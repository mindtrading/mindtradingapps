    <p><strong>REVERSALS &amp; CONTINUATION</strong><br />
        A trend changing its direction is referred to as a reversal. For instance, the market was uptrending until price hit a <br />significant resistance level, then it reversed and became downtrending. Reversal refers to that.</p>
    <p><br /><strong>Where can reversals occur? The main regions where price reversals do occur are as follows: </strong><br /><strong>➢ Fibonacci levels,</strong><br /><strong>➢ Support levels, </strong><br /><strong>➢ Resistance levels</strong></p>
    <p><br />Here is an illustration of a price that reversed from a support level and rose before subsequently breaking it and falling. After the price tested the level again and the price fell, the broken support level is now acting as resistance.</p>

    <p>What then, about continuation? Well, to put it simply, continuation denotes that a major trend, such an uptrend, is still in effect. and you'll see that the
    price slows down, possibly consolidates for a little while, and possibly drops back down a bit. It is comparable to a 
    downswing, which is a tiny downturn in a major uptrend.</p>

<p>
    Therefore, it is referred to as a continuation when that occurs and price resumes moving in the initial upward direction. This idea is illustrated in the chart below.</p>

    <p style="color: red;"><strong>Therefore, the key concern is how to identify trend continuity and place trades at the appropriate time.</strong></p>

<p><br />You will learn more about chart patterns and candlestick patterns in this books section on how to identify precise chart patterns and very specific candlestick patterns.</p>

<p style="color: green;"><br /><strong>3 reasons why understanding reversal points/levels as well as trend continuity patterns and signals is crucial for you:</strong></p>
<p><br />1. Avoid buying at or close to a resistance level.<br />2. You shouldn't sell close or at a support level.<br />3. You need to understand continuation charts and candlestick patterns so that you can trade with the trend. You don't want to purchase when the trend<br />is down and you don't want to sell when the trend is up. (There are instances though, such in trading channels, which would be covered in chapter nine).</p>
