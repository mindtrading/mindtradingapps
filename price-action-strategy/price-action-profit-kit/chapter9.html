    <strong style="color: green;">Profitable Chart Patterns .</strong> <br><br>

    
    Chart patterns and candlestick patterns differ from one another. Chart patterns differ from candlestick patterns, and
    candlestick patterns differ from chart patterns.<br><br>

    ☐ A trader can use chart patterns to understand price activity and predict where the price is likely to go by
    identifying geometric shapes in the price data.<br><br>

    ☐ Candlestick patterns, on the other hand, can involve a single candlestick or a collection of candles that have
    developed sequentially in terms of their body length, opening and closing prices, wicks (or shadows), and other
    characteristics.<br><br>

   <span style="color: red;"> Being unaware of the chart patterns that are developing can be expensive. If that describes you, now is the time
    to change course.</span><br><br>

    Why would something so expensive be a mistake? You take a trade that is absolutely out of line with what the chart
    pattern is signaling or telling you since you have no idea what is developing on the charts and are utterly
    unconscious of it!<br><br>

    <span style="color: green;"> You Will Discover Nine Chart Patterns And They Are As Follows: </span><br><br>
    <strong>
    ☐ Symmetrical, ascending, and descending
    triangle chart patterns (3 patterns)<br>

    ☐ Head-shoulders-and-Shoulders-Inverse (2 patterns) <br>
    ☐ Double Top and Bottom (2 patterns)<br>
    ☐ Tripple Top and Tripple Bottom (2 patterns)<br>    

    I'll start off by discussing triangle chart patterns.</strong><br><br>

    <strong style="color: green;"> Triangle with equal sides (Symmetrical Triangle)</strong> <br><br>

    There are three different triangle chart patterns, and the graphic below clearly illustrates how they differ from one
    another:
<p>
    <img src="images/43.webp"/>


</p>
     <strong>  Let's begin by looking at the
        symmetrical triangular pattern.</strong> <br><br>

        <strong style="color: red;">Are Symmetrical Triangles Bullish Or Bearish Charts Patterns?</strong> <br><br> 
        
        The symmetrical triangle chart pattern can be bullish or bearish because it is a continuation pattern <br><br>

        <p>
            <img src="images/44.webp"/>
    
        </p>

        <strong> So what does this mean? Well, If you notice this pattern during an uptrend, prepare for an upside breakout.
        See an illustration below:</strong> <br><br>

        <p>
            <img src="images/45.webp"/>
        
        </p>

        <strong>    Expect a breakout of this pattern to the downside, as
        demonstrated in the example below, if you observe a symmetrical triangle pattern forming in a downtrend:
    </strong> <br><br>

    <p> <img src="images/46.webp"/> </p>

    <strong style="color: red;">Drawing A Symmetrical Triangle</strong><br><br>
    
    ☐ You'll notice that the price is fluctuating up and down, yet it is actually convergent at one point. <br>
    ☐ For you to construct the two trendlines on both sides, there must be a minimum of two peaks and two troughs. <br>
    ☐ It won't take long for the price to deviate from the pattern and go up or down.<br>

 <p> <img src="images/47.webp"/> </p>

 <strong style="color: green;">Trading the Symmetrical Triangle In Two Simple Method</strong><br><br>
     
   <span style="color: green;"> 1. Trade The Initial Breakout Of The Symmetrical Triangle.</span><br>
    The ideal strategy is to use a candlestick to verify that the breakout actually occurs before placing your symmetrical
    triangles form order. What I do, for instance, is watch<br>
    in the 4 hour charts because I know a breakthrough is about to occur.<br>
    In order to wait for the breakthrough, I then turn to the 1 hour chart. My trade entry signal is a 1 hour candlestick
    that has broken the triangle and closed below or above it. As a result, I'll put in a pending buy/sell stop order to take
    advantage of the breakout from there.<br><br>
    In order to capture the move that occurs and prevent false breakouts while the candlestick is still open, I frequently
    want to wait until the 1 hour candlestick closes outside of the triangle before entering a pending buy stop or sell stop
    order.<br><br>
    The issue with trading triangle breakouts is as follows, as shown in the chart below:

    <p> <img src="images/48.webp"/> </p>

  <span style="color: red;"> Here are several reasons why I don't enjoy trading breakouts like the one above:</span> <br>
  
  <span style="color: green;"> ☐ There is an excessive stop loss distance. I prefer to place trades with
    breakout candlesticks that are near the broken trend lines. <br>
    
    ☐ As shown in the above chart, I frequently observe
    that such breakouts of extremely long candlesticks are not sustainable, and
    the price will frequently tend to turn around after such candlesticks.
    Take note that the price fell for the next four candlesticks after the
    breakout candlestick, which was followed by one bearish green pin
    bar. This is what tends to happened with such long breakout
    candlesticks. So if you entered a buy order using that long breakout
    candlestick above, you would have to wait a while for your trade to
    turn profitable.</span><br><br>

   <span style="color: red;">  2. Trade The Retest Of The Broken Trendline</span><br>
    ● The second method of entry is to wait for a retest of the triangle pattern's broken trendline before buying or
    selling.<br><br>
    ● This may also be useful if your first breakout candlestick was quite long; in that case, your best course of action is
    to wait for a retest of the breakout trendline before entering.<br><br>

   <strong>Options For Placing Stop Losses.</strong> <br><br>
    The following three methods for placing stop losses on triangle patterns which comprises TRIANGLE of
    SYMMETRICAL, ASCENDING, AND DESCENDING PATTERNS are described. Take notice that the stop
    loss  placement methods used here work for all triangle patterns .

    <p> <img src="images/49.webp"/> </p>

  <strong> Chart Patterns Of Ascending Triangle</strong> <br>

    An ascending triangle pattern resembles the chart below:

    <p> <img src="images/50.webp"/> </p>


    <strong> And the appearance of a genuine chart is as follows:</strong>
    <p> <img src="images/51.webp"/> </p>

   <strong> Is The Ascending Triangle a Bullish or Bearish Pattern?</strong><br><br>
    In an ongoing upswing, it is regarded as a bullish continuation pattern. So, when you notice this developing during
    an upswing, prepare for an upside breakout.<br><br>

    When it forms in a downtrend, though, it can also be a powerful reversal indicator (bullish). <br>
    
   <span style="color: red;">Options for Placing Stop Losses</span> <br>
    The tactics listed in the symmetrical triangle can be used.<br><br>

    <span style="color: green;">  Options For Take Profit</span><br>

    I like to set my take-profit target at previous resistance levels.<br>
    You can also set your take-profit goal at the "x" pip distance, as seen on the chart below. Another approach would
    be to choose a distance that is two or three times the "x" pips. That ought to indicate your desired degree of earnings
    (s).
    <p> <img src="images/52.webp"/> </p>

   <strong> Chart Patterns Of Descending Triangle</strong><br><br>
    The descending triangle chart pattern has a few significant points to be aware of:
    Until a breakthrough occurs to the downside, the descending triangle chart pattern is characterized by declining
    resistance levels and reasonably horizontal support levels converging at a point as shown below:
    
    <p> <img src="images/53.webp"/> </p>

    <span style="color: red;">On the chart below, a descending triangle appears as follows:</span> <br>

        <p> <img src="images/54.webp"/> </p>

        <span style="color: red;">  Are Descending Triangle Pattern Bullish Or Bearish?</span><br>

        It develops as a continuation pattern in a downtrend and is a bearish chart pattern.<br><br>

        At the end of an uptrend, this pattern can also appear as a bearish reversal pattern.
      <strong>Therefore, it is a bearish chart pattern regardless of where it develops.</strong>  <br><br>

      <strong> The Descending Triangle Formation Trading Strategy</strong> <br><br>


        The initial breakout can be traded, like with the other 2 triangle formations, or you can wait to see if the price
        reverses to test the broken support level before selling.<br><br>

        Note: When trading a triangular pattern, I frequently choose to hold off until a candlestick breaks out and closes
        outside of the pattern. By doing this, misleading breakout indications are decreased.<br><br>

        However, there are instances when I will just trade the breakout with a pending sell stop order just a few pips below
        the support level to catch the breakout when it occurs. However, when I do this, I sit and watch the 1hr candlestick's
        finish to ensure that it does not close above the support line (if that happens, it may mean a false breakout).<br><br>
        
        The issue of exceptionally long breakout candlesticks is also present, as shown in the following example:<br><br>
        <p> <img src="images/55.webp"/> </p>
      <strong style="color: red;">As was previously stated,</strong><br>
        it is preferable to wait and see if price will reverse and climb back up to the support level that was broken (a retest),
        which will now be acting as a resistance level, before selling when that level is struck when you witness such
        exceptionally extended breakout candlesticks.<br><br>

      <strong style="color: red;">  Profit Taking</strong><br>
        As my take profit target level, I like to use previous support levels, lows, or troughs.<br>
        Measure the height of the triangle; if the height is, say, 100 pips, then that is your take-profit aim. This is another
        classic take-profit technique. You can see exactly how to do it from the chart below:
        <p> <img src="images/56.webp"/> </p>

     <span style="color: red;">   Be aware that the falling triangle on the chart marked the conclusion of an uptrend.</span><br><br>
      
     <strong style="color: green;">Chart Pattern Of The Head and Shoulders</strong><br><br>
    
     A bearish chart pattern is the head and shoulders pattern. A head and shoulders reversal pattern appears as follows:
        
        <p> <img src="images/57.webp"/> </p>

       <span style="color: rgb(121, 121, 121);" >The head and shoulder pattern has the following important considerations:</span><br><br>

        The head and shoulders pattern is a bearish reversal pattern that denotes the conclusion of an uptrend when it
        appears during one.<br><br>

      <strong> THIS IS HOW THE PATTERN DEVELOPS:</strong> <br><br>
        ● Once the market has been rising for a while, it eventually starts to slow down and the forces of supply and demand
        are generally thought to be in balance.<br>

        ● The downside is tested as sellers enter at the highs (left shoulder) (beginning neckline.)<br>
        ● Soon after their return, buyers drove prices up to new highs (head.)<br>
        ● But the fresh highs are rapidly reversed, and the downside is once more challenged (continuing neckline.)<br>
        ● The market rallies once more as tentative buying reappears, but it is unable to surpass the prior high. (This final
        piece is regarded as the right shoulder.)<br><br>

       <span style="color: red;"> Buying stops, and the market once more tries its downside. You should create your trendline for this pattern
        from the starting neckline to the remaining neckline.</span>

        <p> <img src="images/58.webp"/> </p>

        <p>Here's one more:</p>

         <p> <img src="images/59.webp"/> </p>

       <strong> Head and Shoulders Chart Pattern Trading .</strong> <br><br>
        This figure below clarifies it a lot better.<br><br>
        <p> <img src="images/60.webp"/> </p>

      <span style="color: green;" > 1. Go short when price breaks below the neckline, then place a stop loss above the neck peak.<br>

        2. If price comes back to the neckline, go short on a reversal signal and place a stop loss above the resistance
        level.</span><br><br>
       
      <strong> Profit Target Calculation</strong> <br><br>

        ● To determine my take profit target, I use past lows or troughs. <br>

        ● However, you can also set your take profit target
        level as the number of pip between the neckline and the head. Then, if you trade the initial breakout and the distance is 100 pips, you set it
        at the 100 pips take profit target level, as in the chart below with the two blue lines:

        <p> <img src="images/61.webp"/> </p>

        <strong style="color: red;">  The Head And Shoulder Pattern In Reverse (Inverse)</strong><br><br>

        Even though it is less common, you will still encounter this pattern, so keep an eye out for it. The head and
    shoulders pattern's exact opposite, the inverse head and shoulders pattern, is a bullish reversal candlestick pattern<br><br>

    It appears as follows:<br><br>
    Inverted Head and Shoulders as a reversal pattern in a downtrend ( bullish)
    
     <p> <img src="images/62.webp"/> </p>

     And it looks like this on an actual chart:

     <p> <img src="images/63.webp"/> </p>


     <strong style="color: red;">  Trading Technique for the Inverse Head and Shoulders </strong><br><br>
     You can either buy at the neckline's initial breakout or wait until the price has broken out once more and been tested
     at the broken neckline before buying. Use bullish reversal candlesticks as confirmation for your trade entrance if
     you're waiting to buy on a retest.
     <p> <img src="images/64.webp"/> </p>

         I typically set my profit target at previous highs. Your profit target can be established by measuring the separation
        between the head up and the trendline and translating the measurement to pip units. Look at the chart above,
        particularly the two vertical blue lines.<br><br>

     <strong>  Double Bottom Chart Pattern.</strong><br>

        When a double bottom chart pattern appears during a downtrend that is already in place, it suggests that an upward
        trend may be on the horizon. Here's how it appears:

        <p> <img src="images/65.webp"/> </p>

        On a real forex chart, a double bottom pattern appears as follows:

        <p> <img src="images/66.webp"/> </p>

    <strong>  Three methods for Trading Double Bottoms</strong>  
    <strong>   1. Trade The Neckline Breakout:</strong>  <br>
        When a double pattern has developed and the neckline is being tested, many traders jump in as soon as a breakout
        takes place.<br><br>
        <strong>   2. Delay entering the Broken Neckline retest.</strong>  <br>
        Other traders prefer to join when the price reverses back down to touch the neckline, which now serves as a support
        level. When it reaches that particular level, people purchase.<br><br>

        <strong>     3. Buy second-to-last bottom.( bottom 2)</strong>  <br>
        If the neckline is intercepted in this way, you may be able to ride the trade all the way up. Consider buying at bottom
        2 as buying at a support level— because that is exactly what you are doing! For trading entrance signals, look for
        bullish reversal candlestick patterns.<br><br>

        <strong>    Taking Profit Option</strong>  <br><br>

        ● The neckline or any previous highs above that can be used as your takeprofit target levels if you buy at bottom 2
        of the chart.<br>
        ● Use the number of pip intervals between the neckline's bottom and top to determine your profit target if you
        decide to purchase the neckline's breakout. See the example in the chart below:

        <p> <img src="images/67.webp"/> </p>

       <strong>Chart Pattern of a Double Top</strong> <br><br>
        When a double top chart pattern is seen during an uptrend and the neckline is broken, a downtrend is confirmed.
        This pattern is a bearish reversal pattern. The twin tops are incredibly potent patterns, and if you enter a trade at the
        proper time, you might benefit greatly when the negative breakout occurs.<br><br>

      <strong>  Here is an illustration of a double top chart pattern:</strong>

      <p> <img src="images/68.webp"/> </p>

    <span style="color: green;"  >The Double Top Chart Pattern Trading</span><br><br>
        The double top chart pattern can be traded in 3 different ways:<br>
        ● Trade the neckline's initial breakout.<br>
        ● The method I prefer to use when I detect a bearish reversal candlestick is
        to enter a sell trade on Peak. <br><br>
        
        2. And your earnings are significantly increased if the price declines, crosses the
        neckline, and continues to decline.<br><br>
        <p> <img src="images/69.webp"/> </p>

        ● If you want to sell, you can wait for the price to test the broken neckline,
        which is now a level of resistance, and then do so when you see a bearish reversal candlestick pattern, as demonstrated by the example below:<br><br>
        <p> <img src="images/70.webp"/> </p>
        On a live forex chart it appears like the image below

        <p> <img src="images/71.webp"/> </p>

      <strong style="color: green;">  Taking Profit From The Double Top Chart Pattern:</strong><br><br>

        To determine take profit levels, use past lows (support levels). Alternatively, if you are trading the breakout from the
        neckline, you might calculate the distance between the neckline and the highest peak (the range) and use that
        difference in pips as your take-profit target.
        <br><br>

       <strong>  Triple Bottom Chart Pattern </strong><br><br>

        Triple bottoms are not forming as frequently, in my opinion. Whatever the case, you should know what it appears to
        be:
        <p> <img src="images/72.webp"/> </p>
        Note that triple bottoms are bullish reversal chart patterns, therefore if they appear during a downtrend and the price
        moves upward after the neckline is broken, this indicates that the trend is moving upward.<br><br>

       <span style="color: rgb(139, 139, 139);"> Look at this illustration bellow:</span>
       <p> <img src="images/73.webp"/> </p>

       <strong style="color: red;"> Trading The Triple Bottoms </strong><br><br>

       ● Many traders choose to trade the initial breakout only after the neckline has been breached.<br>
       ● Others, upon spotting a bullish reversal candlestick, will hold off placing a buy order until the broken neckline is
       tested again.<br>

       ● I like to watch the price action before entering trades on the third bottom. I purchase when I spot a bullish reversal
       candlestick pattern. Why do I act that way? I would make a lot more money than if I had purchased the neckline
       breakout if the price rose and broke through it.<br><br>

       Profit-taking strategies would resemble the previously mentioned doublebottom chart pattern.<br><br>

     <strong>Charts Patterns of the Triple Top</strong>  <br><br>

       In contrast to triple bottoms, triple tops are bearish chart patterns. Although they are uncommon, it is nonetheless
       wise to be aware of their appearance. When a triple top is discovered during an uptrend, the uptrend is over when the
       neckline is broken and the price starts to fall.
       <p> <img src="images/74.webp"/> </p>

      <span style="color: red;"> The Triple Top Chart Pattern Trading.</span><br><br>
        ● Some cautious traders will only trade a breakout if the neckline is broken. <br>
        ● Some people will probably hold off
        on selling until the neckline is retested. <br>
        ● I like to place trades on Peak 3 because I can make much more money if
        the trade breaks the neckline and goes all the way down. The secret to taking a profitable trade on the 3
        rd peak is by
        keeping an eye out for bearish reversal candlesticks , you can make money.<br><br>
        
        <span style="color: red;">  Going Short Signal </span><br>
        ● If you place a trade at peak 3, the neckline might be your profit goal. <br>
        ● Alternatively, if you decide to trade on the
        breakout of the neckline,
        determine your profit objective by multiplying the distance in pips between the neckline and the highest of the three
        peaks. Alternately, you might use a previous low as your take profit target level.
