    <h2>The Natural Laws of Trading That Nobody Tells You</h2>
    <p>When you throw an Apple, what happens next? Well, it’s only a matter of time before the Apple drops to the ground, right? That’s because the law of gravity is at play here. And it’s the same with trading. Certain laws govern profitable trading, and if you break them, it’s nearly impossible to become a consistently profitable trader. So here are the natural laws of trading you that need to embrace if you want to become a profitable trader.</p>
    <h3>FOLLOWING A CONSISTENT SET OF ACTIONS LEADS TO CONSISTENT RESULTS</h3>
    <p>I know this sounds like a no-brainer, but it’s true. You must follow a consistent set of actions if you want consistent results. This is easier said than done because when you encounter a losing streak, you’ll have the urge to do something about it. You’ll have thoughts like this:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>“Let me remove my stop loss so I don’t get stopped out.”</li>
        <li>“Let me double down so I can recoup my losses quickly.”</li>
        <li>“This strategy is not working anymore, let me find something else.”</li>
    </ul>
    <p>And if you give in to your thoughts, you won’t be consistent in your strategy—which means you won’t get consistent results. The bottom line is this: If you want to become a consistent trader, you must have a consistent set of actions.</p>
    <h3>YOU MUST HAVE AN EDGE IN THE MARKETS</h3>
    <p>Now, even if you are consistent in your actions, this doesn’t mean you’ll be a consistently profitable trader. Why? Because your trading strategy must provide you with an edge in the markets. What do I mean by having an edge?</p>
    <p>Let me give you an example:</p>
    <p>Let’s say I make a bet with you. Every time you toss a coin, and it comes up heads, you win $2. And if it comes up tails, you lose $1. In the long run, you’ll make money with this arrangement because you have an edge over me.</p>
    <p>And it’s the same with trading. If you want to profit from the markets in the long run, your trading strategy must give you an edge. This is because without an edge, even if you have the best risk management, discipline, and psychology, you’ll still be a losing trader.</p>
    <h3>THE LAW OF LARGE NUMBERS</h3>
    <p>This is an important concept to grasp. The law of large number states that in the short run, your results are random, but they’ll align towards its expectancy in the long run.</p>
    <p>I know that sounds confusing so let me give you an example.</p>
    <p>Let’s say you toss a coin 10 times and you get 6 heads and 4 tails. Would you claim the coin has a 60% chance of coming up heads and a 40% chance of coming up tails? Of course not. Intuitively, you understand this because you only tossed the coin 10 times. But if you were to toss the coin 1000 times, it would be closer to 50% heads and 50% tails. And this is what the law of large numbers is about. In the short run, your trading results are random. And it’s only in the long run, after a decent sample size of trades, that your system will align toward its expectancy.</p>
    <p>This is important to understand because if you’re unaware of it, you’ll abandon your trading strategy after a few losing trades without understanding that the results you’ve been observing are actually random.</p>
    <h3>ALWAYS TAKE CARE OF YOUR DOWNSIDE</h3>
    <p>The most important rule of trading is to play great defense, not great offence. — Paul Tudor Jones. Here’s the thing: Your trading strategy can have an edge in the markets, but without proper risk management, you’ll still blow up your trading account.</p>
    <p>Let me give you an example.</p>
    <p>Imagine there are two traders, John and Sally. John is an aggressive trader, and he risks 25% of his account on each trade. Sally is a conservative trader, and she risks 1% of her account on each trade. Both adopt a trading strategy that wins 50% of the time with an average risk-to-reward ratio of 1:2.</p>
    <p>Over the next 8 trades, the outcomes are lose, lose, lose, lose, win, win, win, win.</p>
    <p>Before you think this is an unlikely scenario, remember the law of large numbers? So here’s the outcome for John: -25% -25% -25% -25% = BLOW UP Here’s the outcome for Sally: -1% -1% -1% -1% +2% +2% +2% +2% = +4%</p>
    <p>Are you getting the hang of how important this is? Risk management can be a deciding factor in whether you’re a consistently profitable trader or a losing trader. Remember, you can have the best trading strategy in the world. But without proper risk management, you will still blow up your trading account. It’s not a question of if, but when.</p>
    <h3>YOU NEED MONEY TO MAKE MONEY</h3>
    <p>Sorry to burst your bubble, but you need money to make money in this business. Here’s why.</p>
    <p>Let’s say you make an average of 20%/year. On a $1,000 account, you’ll make $200/year. On a $100,000 account, you’ll make $20,000/year. On a $1M account, you’ll make $200,000/year.</p>
    <p>Now, you might think that 20% a year is too low and that you can make 100% a year. Sure, that’s possible by taking huge risks. But I’m talking about making consistent returns, not “go-big-or-go-home” kinds of returns.</p>
    <p>Don’t believe me? Then ask yourself, why do hedge funds raise millions (or even billions) of dollars? Why don’t they just trade their own money without having anyone to answer to? It’s because they want you to be rich and make this world a better place. Hmm.</p>
    <h3>YOU MAKE BIG MONEY BY COMPOUNDING YOUR RETURNS</h3>
    <p>Sure, you can make a living trading full-time. But if you want to make big money, then you must compound your returns. Let me give you an example.</p>
    <p>Let’s say you make an average of 20% a year with a $100,000 account. Every year, you use all your trading profits to sustain your lifestyle. This means you’re back at $100,000 at the start of the next year. But what if you have a job or business that covers your expenses so you don’t have to withdraw money from your account. How would this change things?</p>
    <p>You make an average of 20% a year on a $100,000 account, but if you don’t withdraw your profits, you can compound your returns over time. After 10 years, your account will be worth $619,173. After 20 years, it will be worth $3,833,759. After 30 years, it will be worth $23,737,631. You get my point.</p>
    <p>But do you know where the biggest money is made? Other people’s money (OPM). Yup, you read me right. The biggest money is made by managing other people’s money. But don’t take my word for it. Just look at the richest finance people on Forbes, and you’ll see that most of them own hedge funds. And what do hedge funds do? They manage other people’s money.</p>
    <h3>THERE’S NO BEST TRADING STRATEGY OUT THERE</h3>
    <p>This is one of the most common questions I get from traders: “Hey Rayner, what is the best trading strategy out there?” I’ll be honest. There’s no such thing as the best trading strategy because it’s not possible to define what “best” means. “Best” could mean many things: highest returns, lowest drawdown, least time required, low capital requirements, the list goes on. Clearly, what’s “best” to you might seem terrible to someone else. So instead of looking for the best trading strategy, you first have to know what your trading goals are. Once you understand that, you can select the “best” trading strategy to meet your goals.</p>
    <h3>NO TRADING STRATEGY WORKS ALL THE TIME</h3>
    <p>Trading strategies seek to exploit certain “patterns” in the markets. If you want a trading strategy to work all the time, market conditions must remain the same. But ask yourself, is this possible? If you’ve traded long enough, you’ll know it’s not because the market is always changing. It can move from an uptrend to a downtrend, low volatility to high volatility, and so on. And if the markets are always changing, then it means no trading strategy works all the time (and this is how a drawdown occurs). So forget about using a single trading strategy to make money every day (or every week). It doesn’t work that way. Instead, you’ll go through a cycle of ups and downs. You want to keep your profits during the good times so you can pay for your losses during the bad. The key is to play good defense so you can survive to experience the good times again.</p>
    <h3>THE SECRET TO MAKING PROFITS EVERY DAY</h3>
    <p>This is the secret to making daily profits: The frequency of your trades. Yes, you read me right. If you want to make money every single day, you need to trade frequently so the law of large numbers can work in your favor (within a short time frame). Confused? No worries, I’ll explain. Imagine the following scenario:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You have a special coin in your hands.</li>
        <li>If it comes up heads, you win $2.</li>
        <li>If it comes up tails, you lose $1.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>But here’s the catch: You can only toss your coin once a day. Do you think you’ll be able to make money every single day doing this? Of course not. Why? Because in the short run, your coin toss results are random—you could get tails many times in a row (and thus lose many days in a row). Now, what if you could toss your coin 1,000 times a day? How would the results change? Well, you’d get close to 50% heads and 50% tails after 1,000 tosses—which means you’d be guaranteed to make money every day because your edge could play out within a short period of time.</p>
    <p>Does this make sense? Great! Because this concept is the same as trading. If you want to make money every day, you must have a high frequency of trades. But is this feasible for a retail trader? In my opinion, the odds are stacked against you because commissions are sky high, and it’s unlikely you’ll be able to (consistently and profitably) spot a sufficiently high number of trading opportunities with your naked eye alone.</p>
    <p>That’s why this field is largely dominated by high-frequency trading firms, and yes, they can make money (almost) every day. One example is Virtu Financial, which according to Bloomberg, had one day of trading losses in 1,238 days (during the 2009–2014 period).</p>
    <p>So does this mean you can’t trade for a living? Nope, it doesn’t mean that. It means you shouldn’t expect to make money every single day—and this isn’t to say that you can’t make money every quarter or every year.</p>
    <h3>TRADING IS A GET-RICH-SLOW SCHEME</h3>
    <p>Many people get involved in trading because they want to make money—and they want to make it fast. But I’m here to tell you trading is a get-rich-slow scheme. Sure, you can make money fast, but you’ll lose it equally as fast (or faster). So if you want longevity in your career, treat trading as a business (not a get-rich-quick scheme). Here’s how it works:</p>
    <p>If you start with a $5,000 account, and you make an average of 20% a year, after 20 years, your account will be worth $191,688. But let’s take things a step further. Let’s add another $5,000 to your account every year. Again, if you make an average of 20% a year, after 20 years, it’ll be worth $1,311,816. How “fast” you can get rich depends on two things: your account size and your percentage return. Sure, you can increase your return by risking more, but the risk of drawdown is larger—and you risk losing everything. So my suggestion is to risk small, add more funds regularly, and compound your way to riches. Yes, it takes time, but the risk of ruin is dramatically reduced.</p>
    <h2>AT THIS POINT…</h2>
    <p>You’ve learned the natural laws of trading and how they work. This will give you a good idea of what profitable trading is about so you can ignore the noise and focus on the stuff that matters. Next, we’ll look at the basics of price action trading. You’ll learn what it is, why it matters, and what its pros and cons are.</p>
    <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>If you want to be a consistent trader, you must be consistent in your actions.</li>
        <li>You must have an edge in the markets because without one, even the best risk management or trading psychology won’t save your account.</li>
        <li>The law of large numbers means your trading results will be random in the short run. In the long run, they’ll align towards its expectancy.</li>
        <li>Always take care of your downside. The best trading strategy is useless if you don’t contain your losses.</li>
        <li>You need money to make money in this business.</li>
        <li>The big money is made from compounding your returns, and the biggest money is made from managing other people’s money (OPM).</li>
        <li>There’s no such thing as the best trading strategy because “best” is subjective.</li>
        <li>No trading strategy works all the time because the markets are always changing.</li>
        <li>Trading frequency matters. Don’t expect to make money every day if you only take two trades per day.</li>
        <li>Trading is a get-rich-slow scheme. If you add funds to your account regularly and compound them over time, you’ll eventually get rich—but it takes time.</li>
