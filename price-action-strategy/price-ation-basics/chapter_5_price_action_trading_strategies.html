    <h3>Price Action Trading Strategies</h3>
    <p>Do you know why the racing horses' eyes are covered with blinkers or
        blinders? These blinders are made up of leather or plastic. These are placed
        on both sides of the horse.
        </p>
 
    <p>It reduces the angle of the horses' vision by over 75%, but still, all the
        riders (especially in the races) use it. Are they crazy?</p>

    <p>The reason is pretty simple and straightforward.</p>

    <p>Horses have eyes at the sides of their face, which means they have
        peripheral vision. It can easily provoke the horse to run in any direction
        unless they are made to remain focused.</p>

        <p>When the riders attach blinders, it will cover the side angle vision and
            focus ahead. With this device's help, racing horses concentrate better on the
            target, and they can run with astonishing speed.
            </p>

     <p>The same logic applies to all traders.
        We have many trading types, such as Swing Trading, Positional Trading,
        Trend Following, etc.
        If I stop at this point, traders will take trades in all possible trading styles
        and lose money. So, I will cover a few critical trading styles, and you can
        pick any one trading style which suits your personality.
        Please note, there is no need to implement all of them in your trading.
        
    
     <h4> Swing Trading</h4>
   <p> Swing trading is a trading technique that seeks to capture a full swing
    when the price goes to a complete sideways zone.</p>
     
     <p><img src="images/44.webp"/></p>
     <p>Image 5.1 – Swing Trading</p>

     <p>The idea is to get out of the trade before the opposing pressure comes in. It means you look to book your profits before the market reverses.</p>

    <p><img src="images/45.webp"/></p>

    <p>Image 5.2 – Swing Trading Strategy</p>

    <p>Identify a range-bound stock or index as the first step.
        For a long trade, look for bullish candlestick patterns such as – Bullish
        Engulfing, Bullish Harami, Hammer, Morning Star.
        If you see the price confirmation, opt for a long trade above the chart
        pattern's high, keeping a stop-loss below the low of the chart pattern.
        You can aim for the next resistance line as your target. Plan the trade
        only if the risk-reward is greater than 1:2.</p>

     <p>Image 5.4 – Swing Trading ‘Long’ trade example-2</p>

     <p>Image 5.3 and image 5.4 are examples for long trades in swing trading
        using candlestick patterns. In both cases, the price is in a sideways trend.
        There was a good support trend line, and the price displayed candlestick
        confirmation (Hammer in 5.3 and Bullish Harami in 5.4).
        Hence, a long trade can be planned above the high of the confirmation
        candle, keeping a stop-loss below the confirmation candle's low.
        The target will be the next resistance zone, as highlighted in the image.
        For a short trade, look for bearish candlestick patterns such as – Bearish
        Engulfing, Bearish Harami, Hanging man, Evening Star, pin bar.
        If you see the price confirmation, opt for a short trade below the chart
        pattern's low, keeping a stop-loss above the high of the chart pattern.
        You can aim for the next support line as your target. Plan the trade only
        if the risk-reward is greater than 1:2.</p>

     <p><img src="images/49.webp"/></p>
     <p>Image 5.6 – Swing Trading ‘Short’ trade example-2</p>

     <p>Image 5.5 and image 5.6 are examples of short trades in swing trading
        using candlestick patterns.</p>
        <p>In both cases, the price is in a sideways trend. There was a good
            resistance trend line, and the price displayed candlestick confirmation (pin
            bar + bearish harami in 5.5 and bearish engulfing in 5.6).
            Hence, a short trade can be planned below the low of the confirmation
            candle, keeping a stop-loss above the confirmation candle's high.
            The target will be the next support zone, as highlighted in the images.</p>

        <h4>Trend Following</h4>

        <p>In this system, ‘Trend’ plays a crucial role as all the trades will come in the direction of the trend.</p>
    <p>For long trades, the prior trend should be on the upside. If the price shows healthy correction and a candlestick pattern, one can plan a long trade.</p>
    <p>For short trades, the prior trend should be down. If the price shows a bounce and a candlestick pattern, one can plan a short trade.</p>
    <h3>Rules for Long Trades:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Price should be in a clear uptrend</li>
        <li>Healthy pullback</li>
        <li>Price should display a bullish candlestick pattern at the support line</li>
        <li>Risk-Reward should be a minimum of 1:1.5</li>
    </ol>

            <p>Image 5.8 – Trend Following ‘Long’ trade in USD-CAD</p>

            <p>Images 5.7 and 5.8 are simple examples for long trades using the trend
                following technique.
                In both the cases, the prior trend is up, there was a healthy pullback, and
                candlestick confirmation occurred exactly at the support trend line
                (‘hammer’ in 5.7 and ‘bullish engulfing’ in 5.8).
                A trader can plan a long trade above the high of the confirmation candle,
                keeping a stop-loss below the low of the confirmation candle.
                The previous swing high is the safe target (as the primary trend is up).
                Hence, we can plan to exit 50-75% of the position at the target and carry the
                remaining position by trailing stop-loss below every swing low.
                Trailing stop-loss is the most critical aspect of the trend following system
                as you never know where the trend will stop. In fact, it is the core logic in
                this trading approach. Sometimes, profits in one trade (using trailing S.L.)
                can absorb the loss of many failed trades.</p>

                <h3>Rules for Short Trades:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Price should be in a clear downtrend</li>
        <li>Healthy bounce</li>
        <li>Price should display a bearish candlestick pattern at the resistance line</li>
        <li>Risk-Reward should be a minimum of 1:1.5</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Image 5.10 – Trend Following ‘Short’ trade in Ryder System</p>
    
    <p>Images 5.9 and 5.10 are the simple examples for short trades under the
        trend following technique.
        In both cases, the prior trend is down, there was a healthy bounce, and
        candlestick confirmation exactly at the resistance trend line (‘bearish
        engulfing’ in 5.9 and ‘pin bar’ in 5.10).
        A trader can plan a short trade below the low of the confirmation candle,
        keeping a stop-loss above the high of the confirmation candle.
        The previous swing low is the safe target (as the primary trend is down).
        Hence, we can plan to exit 50-75% of the position at the target and carry the
        remaining position by trailing stop-loss above every swing high.
        ‘Swing Trading’ and ‘Trend Following’ are the two simple trading
        systems, and we can apply price action strategies directly in them.
        If you are a beginner or an intermediate level trader, mastering any one
        of these strategies is more than enough to taste success in trading.
        The next chapter contains some advanced trading topics and a few
        trading systems based on those concepts. Again feel free to skip it if you are
        a beginner and go to chapter-7 directly.

        <h4>Breakout Trading</h4>

        <p>A breakout trade opportunity is nothing but a stock price moving outside
            a defined resistance level with increased volume.</p>

        <p><img src="images/54.webp"/></p>
        <p>Image 5.11 – Breakout Trading System</p>

       
            <p>A breakout trader enters a long position after the price breaks above the
                resistance level, keeping a stop-loss below the resistance.
                In this process, they either trail their stop-losses or target to exit at higher
                levels to make profits.</p>
