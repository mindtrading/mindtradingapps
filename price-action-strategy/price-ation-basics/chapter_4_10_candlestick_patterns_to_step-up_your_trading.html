    <h3>10 Candlestick Patterns to Step-up Your Trading</h3>
    <p>I will repeat once again. Two things are crucial in price action trading – 1) Identifying key price levels, and 2) Confirmation or Rejection of the price, to look for any profitable trade opportunities.</p>
    <p>In the last chapter, we have covered different aspects of identifying key price levels using trend lines. This chapter focuses on 10 powerful candlestick patterns used for confirmation/rejection of the price at key price levels.</p>
    <p>Please note, we are not supposed to use these patterns independently. We need to check for these patterns only at the key price levels.</p>
    <p>There are 1000s of candlestick patterns present in the world of technical analysis. Do you think studying and memorizing all of them is practically possible?</p>
    <p>Heck, No! isn’t it? Then what is a better way to shortlist them?</p>
    <p>It's better to shortlist the candlestick patterns based on two parameters:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Impact of the Pattern</li>
        <li>Repeated Occurrence of the Pattern</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Because if a candlestick pattern has less impact, then it is not useful. Similarly, if a candlestick pattern is powerful, but if it rarely occurs, then again, it is of no use. Is it?</p>
    <p>Considering these two parameters, below are some powerful patterns that occur very frequently on all the timeframes.</p>

    <h4>Bullish Engulfing</h4>
    <p>Engulfing candles tend to signal a reversal of the current trend/swing in the market. It involves two candles, with the latter candle 'engulfing' the previous candle's entire body.</p>

    <p><img src="images/22.webp"/></p>
    <p>Image 4.1 – Bullish Engulfing Pattern</p>
    <p>In the bullish engulfing pattern, the first candle will be a small bearish
        candle. The second candle opens below the first bearish candle, trades lower
        than the bearish candle, but due to the entry of powerful bulls, it will witness
        a close above the bearish candle. Hence, it engulfs the first bearish candle.
        It is 'bullish' in nature.</p>

    </p>
    <p><img src="images/24.webp"/></p>
    <p>Image 4.3 – Bullish Engulfing Pattern in Jacobs Engineering</p>

    <p>Image 4.2 and 4.3 are examples of Bullish Engulfing. The price is in
        downtrend/swing, and the bullish engulfing pattern appeared at the support
        trend line. The price rallied on the upside after displaying the bullish
        engulfing pattern.</p>
     <h4> Bearish Engulfing</h4>
   <p> Engulfing candles tend to signal a reversal of the current trend/swing in
    the market. It involves two candles, with the latter candle 'engulfing' the
     previous candle's entire body.</p>
     
     <p><img src="images/25.webp"/></p>
     <p>Image 4.4– Bearish Engulfing Pattern</p>
     <p>In the bearish engulfing pattern, the first candle will be a small bullish
        candle. The second candle opens above the first bullish candle, trades higher
        than the bullish candle. Still, due to the entry of powerful sellers, it will
        witness a close below the bullish candle. Hence, it engulfs the first bullish
        candle. It is 'bearish' in nature.</p>

    <p><img src="images/26.webp"/></p>

    <p>Image 4.5– Bearish Engulfing Pattern in SBIN</p>

    <p><img src="images/27.webp"/></p>
    <p>Image 4.6– Bearish Engulfing Pattern in Bank Nifty</p>

    <p>Images 4.5 and 4.6 are examples of Bearish Engulfing. The price was in
        an uptrend/swing, and the bearish engulfing pattern appeared at the
        resistance trend line. The price fell after forming the bearish engulfing
        pattern.</p>

    <h4>Hammer Pattern</h4>

    <p>
        When a stock price trades significantly lower than the open price, it bounces
        back due to the sudden entry of bulls. It closes a little below or above the
        open price, which results in the Hammer pattern.</p>
        
     <p>If it occurs at a critical support level, then there is a high probability of
     reversal in the price chart.</p>
     <p><img src="images/28.webp"/></p>
     <p>Image 4.7 – Hammer Pattern in Bajaj Finance</p>
     <p><img src="images/29.webp"/></p>
     <p>Image 4.8 – Hammer Pattern in Nifty</p>

     <p>Images 4.7 and 4.8 are examples of a hammer pattern. It derived its name
        as the shape looks like a hammer. In this pattern, the lower shadow is at least
        twice the size of the real body.</p>
        <h4>Hanging Man Pattern</h4>

        <p>
            It looks similar to the Hammer pattern. However, it occurs at the end of the
            uptrend and resembles a hanging man from the top. Hence, it's gets its name.
            It indicates the potential reversal of the price from the uptrend.</p>
            
         <p>If it occurs at a critical resistance level, then there is a high probability of
            reversal in the price.</p>
            <p><img src="images/30.webp"/></p>

            <p>Image 4.9 – Hanging Man Pattern in KELLOGG</p>
            <p><img src="images/31.webp"/></p>
            <p>Image 4.10 – Hanging Man Pattern in TATA Power</p>
            <p>In image 4.9, the price was in an uptrend, and the price displayed the hanging man precisely at the resistance line. In image 4.10, the trend was down, but the hanging man appeared at the upswing within the downtrend.</p>
    <p>It indicates that the buyers have lost their strength to push the price to the upside. Hence, there is a higher probability of price reversing from that level.</p>

    <h4>Harami Pattern</h4>
    <p>Like Engulfing, we have two 'Harami’ patterns – 1) Bullish Harami and 2) Bearish Harami.</p>
    <p>The word ‘Harami’ means a pregnant lady in the Japanese language. This pattern appears like a pregnant lady, and hence it got this name.</p>
    <p><img src="images/32.webp"/></p>
    <p>Image 4.11 – Bullish Harami and Bearish Harami
    </p>
    
    <p>Bullish Harami includes a big bearish candle first, followed by a small
        bullish candle in the middle. It indicates that the selling is over, and there is a
        high probability of the price going upward.</p>
      <p>Bearish Harami includes a big bullish candle first, followed by a small
        bearish candle in the middle. It indicates that the buying is over, and there is
        a high probability of price going in the downside direction.</p>

        <p><img src="images/33.webp"/></p>
        <p>Image 4.12 – Bullish Harami in Maruti</p>
        <p><img src="images/34.webp"/></p>
        <p>Image 4.13 – Bearish Harami in DLF</p>

        <p>The images-4.12 and 4.13 show examples for Bullish Harami and
            Bearish Harami pattern respectively.</p>

            <h4>Morning Star Pattern</h4>
            <p>A morning star pattern consists of three candlesticks, which occur in a
                downtrend and often indicate the beginning of the uptrend.</p>
           
                <p><img src="images/35.webp"/></p>
                <p>Image 4.14 – Morning Star Pattern</p>
                <p><img src="images/36.webp"/></p>
                <p>Image 4.15 – Morning Star Pattern in TATA Steel
                </p>

                <p>It consists of 1-2-3 formation in a downtrend, indicating the sign of a
                    change in the trend. The first candle is bearish, and the second candle
                    indicates indecision, and the third candle indicates the bullish behavior of the
                    price.</p>

                    <h4> Evening Star Pattern</h4>

            <p>It is similar to Morning Star but in the opposite direction. Again this
                  pattern consists of three candlesticks that occur in an uptrend and indicate
                  the beginning of the downtrend.</p>

           <p><img src="images/37.webp"/></p>
           <p>Image 4.16 – Evening Star Pattern</p>
           <p><img src="images/38.webp"/></p>
           <p>Image 4.17 – Evening Star Pattern in GBP-USD</p>
           <p>Similar to Morning Star, this pattern also consists of a 1-2-3 formation
            but in the opposite direction. It indicates sign of a downtrend. The first
            candle is bullish, the second candle indicates indecision, and the third candle
            indicates the bearish behavior of the price.</p>

            <h4>Doji Pattern</h4>
            <p>In a Doji pattern, the open and close prices will be nearly equal for the
                selected time period. It is a neutral pattern that indicates indecision.</p>

           <p><img src="images/39.webp"/></p>
           <p>Image 4.18 – Doji Pattern</p>

           <p>The above image shows different variations of Doji. In all three types, the price closed at the open level. However, based on the location of open/close, it is possible to identify the sentiment behind it.</p>
    <p>In Gravestone Doji, the open & price level will be at the bottom. It indicates that buyers attempted to push the price upside in this period, but they lacked the power to drive the price upside. Hence, it closed at the same open level. We can expect only a downside move until the price negates this pattern.</p>
    <p>In Dragonfly Doji, the situation is precisely the opposite. In this case, sellers tried to push the price downside, but they failed, and hence price closed at the top. Therefore, we can expect only an upside move until the price negates this pattern.</p>
    <p>In Normal Doji (also called Long Legged Doji), there is not much clarity in the price. Besides, it also indicates the equal fight between buyers and sellers. Hence, it shows perfect indecision. It’s always better to wait for the next candle completion if we get a normal doji.</p>

    <h4>Pin bar Patterns</h4>
    <p>A pin bar consists of one candlestick bar, and it represents a strong reversal and rejection of the price. Usually, pin bars have a smaller body and a long tail.</p>
    <p><img src="images/40.webp"/></p>
    <p>Image 4.19 – Pin Bar Patterns</p>
    <p>Again this pattern has two types – 1) Bullish pin bars and 2) Bearish pin
        bars.<br>
        Bullish pin bars are similar to the Hammer pattern. In both types of pin
        bars, the color of the body doesn’t matter much. A longer tail is crucial as it
        shows the rejection of prices at key levels.
        </p>
        <p><img src="images/41.webp"/></p>
<p>Image 4.20 – Bearish Pin Bar Pattern in PAYPAL Holdings</p>


    <p>The above image shows an example of a Bearish Pin bar at the resistance trend line. It indicates the explicit rejection of the price to trade above the resistance trend line. After this point, the price didn’t show any signs of recovery and displayed a significant fall.</p>

    <h2>How to use these Candlestick Patterns?</h2>
    <p>Traders should not use these candlestick patterns independently to take trades. These patterns should only be used at predetermined key price levels (either support or resistance).</p>
    <p>Besides, don’t take the trade before the completion of the pattern. For example, if you are using a 1-hour timeframe, and after 30-45 minutes, if it is looking like any of the above-mentioned candlestick patterns, don’t opt for the trade immediately. Because the pattern might negate or change in the remaining time. It’s always better to plan a trade after the completion of the candlestick pattern.</p>
    <p>It’s always better to finalize a trading system and then to apply these candlestick patterns. Otherwise, a trader loses control of trading and ends up with many losing trades every day.</p>
