    <h3>Never Underestimate Support and Resistance</h3>
    <p>As explained earlier, two things play a crucial role in price action trading:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Identification of Key Price Levels</li>
        <li>Confirmation from the price (either through candlestick patterns or through price acceptance/rejection)</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The 'Key Price Levels' can be identified through many methods. But identifying them through Support/Resistance by drawing trend lines is the most effective method.</p>
    <p>Many traders consider support and resistance concepts as basic trading concepts, and hence they look for some complicated analysis. But simple things can create wonders in life as well as in trading. I request you to have an open mind and read this chapter thoroughly. I promise you that your ideas and understanding of support and resistance will change forever.</p>
    <p>A trader who uses an indicator will have a reference level with an indicator to plan a trade. It can be simple concepts like M.A. crossover, Bollinger Band breakout, or overbought/oversold scenario. However, a price action trader doesn't have this luxury as he has only 'Price' and 'Volume' in his arsenal.</p>
    <p>One can only use Volume for confirmation in the trade setup. Hence, a price action trader has to depend entirely on the 'Price' to plan his trades. It appears as a drawback to the price action traders. But in my opinion, it is a boon for them because they have to study the price in-depth, which is where 'Support' and 'Resistance' play a crucial role.</p>
    <h3>How to Draw Trend lines?</h3>
    <p>A Trend Line is a straight line drawn on a chart by connecting two or more price peaks, which reveals the script's trend, support & resistance points, and allows one to spot any excellent trade opportunities.</p>
    <p>Below are some useful references to draw a trend line:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Try to connect more number of Peaks (a minimum of 2 peaks is mandatory)</li>
        <li>The Slope of the Trend Line should be less than 45 degrees (it is the sign of a healthy trend)</li>
        <li>The price should respect the Trend Line</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Image 3.1 – A Valid Trend Line Example in TCS</p>
    <p>The above image shows an example of a valid trend line. It has
        connected around 8 price peaks. The slope of the trend line (w.r.t imaginary
        horizontal line) is less than 45 degrees, and the price has respected the trend
        line from the beginning to the end.</p>
        <p><img src="images/12.webp"/></p>

        <p>Image 3.2 – An Invalid Trend Line Example in USD-JPY</p>
            
        <p>he trend line which is drawn in image 3.2 is invalid. Because, it has not
            respected the trend line.</p>

        <p>The power of a trend line decreases when the price doesn't respect it in
            between. Always look to draw a clear trend line connecting many price
            peaks.</p>


     <p><img src="images/13.webp"/></p>

<p>Image 3.3 – An Invalid Trend Line Example in USD-INR</p>

<p>Once again, the trend line which is drawn in image 3.3 is invalid.
    Because the slope of the trend line is more than 45 degrees (compared to the
    imaginary horizontal line), it is not a sign of a healthy trend. So, it's better to
    ignore such a trend line.</p>
   
   <h3> What is Support?</h3>
   <p> A support is the price level at which demand is strong enough to prevent
    any further fall in the price.</p>

    <p><img src="images/14.webp"/></p>
<p>Image 3.4 – A Support Trend line example in Tesla INC</p>

<p>The above image shows an example of a support trend line. The logic is
 straightforward. People do remember their entry or exit levels either because
 of pleasure or pain. It would have been pleasure to have made profits or pain
 if they had lost money.</p>

 <p> Hence, whenever the price falls towards support and gets cheaper, buyers
 become more inclined to accumulate the stock. By the time the price reaches
 the support level, it is evident that demand will overcome supply and prevent
 the price from falling below support.</p>

 <p> In image 3.4, whenever the price corrected to 58-59 levels, buyers
 accumulated the stock, and hence it bounced from this level.</p>

        <p><img src="images/15.webp"/></p>

        <p>Image 3.5 – A Support Box example in Canara Bank</p>

        <p>The market is dynamic, and we can’t expect that a single price level acts
            as support every time. Sometimes, a small range of price levels will serve as
            support, which can be called a 'Support Box.'
            In image 3.5, the price range between 130-160 acted as a support box.
            </p>

            <h3>What is Resistance?</h3>
            <p>A resistance is a price level at which selling is strong enough to prevent
                the price from rising further.</p>

                <p><img src="images/16.webp"/></p>

                <p>Image 3.6 – A Resistance Trend line example in Intel Corp</p>

                <p>The above image shows an example of a resistance trend line. The price
                    level 53 acted as resistance.<br>
                    As the price moves towards resistance, sellers will be more active, and
                    buyers will be less inclined to buy. By the time price reaches the resistance
                    level, the supply will overcome the demand and stops the price from rising
                    above resistance.</p>

               <p><img src="images/17.webp"/></p>
               <p>Image 3.7 – A Resistance Box example in Canara Bank</p>

               <p>Like a support box, many times, a range of price levels acts as resistance,
                   which can be recognized as a 'Resistance Box.'
                   In image 3.7, the price range between 290-300 served as resistance.</p>

              <h3> Variations of Support and Resistance</h3>

              <p> There is no rule in the market that support and resistance lines are perfect
               horizontal lines. These support and resistance trend lines often come with a
               small angle, which is also acceptable.</p>

               <p><img src="images/18.webp"/></p>

               <p>Image 3.8 – Angled Resistance Trend line example in NVIDIA Corp</p>
               <p>The above image shows an example of an angled resistance trend line.
                Whenever the price bounced towards the angled resistance trend line, sellers
                entered, and their force pushed the price to the downside.</p>
                <p><img src="images/19.webp"/></p>
                <p>Image 3.9 – Angled Support Trend line example in IMPINJ INC</p>

                <h3>The above image shows an example of an angled support trend line.</h3>
    <p>Whenever the price corrected towards the angled support trend line, buyers entered with buying, and their force pushed the price to the upside.</p>
    <p>I am not in a position to give a valid explanation of why and how these angled trend lines work. However, I have seen it works very well with the market. Hence, I have deployed them in my trading.</p>

    <h3>Fatal Mistakes Every Trader should Avoid</h3>
    <p>Do you know why many traders don't get good results with support and resistance trading concepts? Or can you think of any reason why many traders don't believe in or use support & resistance trading concepts in their trading?</p>
    <p>It points to one simple reason. They assume that a support trend line always prevents the fall and a resistance trend line always resists the bounce. Besides, they fail to understand when the price will take support at the support line or break the support line. The same explanation goes with the resistance line.</p>
    <p>Can you think of any better reason? I am sure there is no other reason.</p>
    <p>What if you develop an ability to understand whether the price will take support at a support trend line or not and whether the price will take resistance at a resistance trend line or not? Then you can make profitable trades most of the time, isn't it?</p>
    <p>Chapter-4 and Chapter-5 explain this concept in detail. But it would be best if you came out of the primary assumption about the infallibility of these lines. A support level may not act as support every time, and a resistance level may not act as resistance every single time.</p>

    <h3>Then why to use support & resistance?</h3>
    <p>I am sure the above question has popped-up in your mind now. But the answer is simple. When the price fails to take support at the support trend line, it gives a big move in the opposite direction, and if we can take this trade, it increases our profits!</p>

    <p><img src="images/20.webp"/></p>

    <p>Image 3.10 – Break of Support Line resulted in a big move downside in L.T</p>
    
    <p>The above image shows an example of the failure of the support line.
        There is a good support trend line on the chart. But when the price reached
        the support trend line on 25th and 26th Feb, it failed to take support due to
        the absence of buyers. Hence, it resulted in a big move to the downside.
        What if you could foresee this and opted for a 'short' trade after the
        breakdown of the support trend line instead of waiting to take a long trade?
        You would have made damn good profits, isn't it? It is the reason we need
        support and resistance trend lines for price action trading.</p>
        <p><img src="images/21.webp"/></p>
        <p>Image 3.11 – Break of Resistance Line resulted in a big move upside in CEAT LTD</p>
        <p>The above image shows an example of a failure of the resistance line.
            There is a good resistance trend line on the chart. But when price breached
            the resistance trend line on 14th March, it resulted in a big move to the
            upside.<br>
            Again, what if you knew early on that the price will not take resistance
            this time? One can take a better entry in the right direction, isn't it?</p>

           <h3> Welcome to the exciting world of PRICE ACTION TRADING!</h3>
           
           <p>  The real essence of price action trading starts in the next chapter. But I
            request you to read and understand this chapter thoroughly as this is the core
            foundation for it.</p>
