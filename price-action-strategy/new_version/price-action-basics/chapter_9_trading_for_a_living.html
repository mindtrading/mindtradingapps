    <h3>Trading for a Living</h3>
    <p>There is a vast difference between ‘Trading for Fun’ and ‘Trading for a Living.’ Trading for fun is like a silly fight between siblings on a cozy bed in a bedroom. Trading for a Living is like a fierce fight between you vs. Mike Tyson, Muhammad Ali, Rocky Marciano, Manny Pacquiao, etc. altogether simultaneously. It is because trading is designed in such a manner. Anyone can enter and participate in the game. When you can take a trade, always remember you are fighting with many people who have spent decades in this business!</p>
    <p>Never plan to take up Trading for a Living just because you have tasted some success in trading. Below guidelines are helpful if you are seriously thinking to consider trading as a profession:</p>
    
    <h3>1 - Passive Income</h3>
    <p>
    I learned so many things in my school and college days except one thing,
    which is how to make money without putting in your TIME and MONEY.
    This art is called 'Passive Income.'
    One has to plan a few passive income sources when they have a decent
    job.
    Having a few passive income sources will increase the confidence in
    your life. It will release the pressure to generate some money every month
    through trading to pay your monthly bills.
    I am sure everyone has some talent or passion for some activity. If you
    keep some focus and get little expertise, you can add a passive source of
    income.

    <p>
    I know everybody can't quit their job and become an entrepreneur. But
    most of us can determine to begin something small today, which can't be
    taken away.
    I can give a few hints:
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>If you are good at photography, upload your good photos online. Many
    portals pay for good photos. For more information
    check, <strong style="color: green;">Shutterstock</strong>,
        <strong style="color: green;">FreeImages</strong>,
        <strong style="color: green;">Pixabay</strong>,
        <strong style="color: green;">Getty Images</strong>,
          <strong style="color: green;">iStockphoto</strong>.</li>
    <li>If you are creative, you can try to develop a cover page for eBooks. Do
    you know how ambitious Amazon is with its KDP project? Mark my words,
    you will see a hell of a lot of eBooks in the next few years, and all those
    eBook authors need attractive cover photos (by the way, the cover page of
    this book is also created in a similar way. That's his side hustle!).
    Check <strong style="color: green;">Fiverr</strong> for more opportunities.</li>
    <li>If you are good at video editing, help YouTubers. Many successful
    people want to start their own YouTube channel, but they are biding their
    time as they don't know how to edit the videos.</li>
    <li>If you are good at teaching something, create a course
    in <strong style="color: green;">Udemy</strong> or <strong style="color: green;">UrbanPro</strong>. If the content is
    good, then it will fetch you money, even when you are sleeping!</li>
    <li>Suppose you are good at yoga and meditation. You can start teaching it
    online. The entire world is your target audience, as everyone is working to
    improve their immunity due to COIVD-19. Find one such inspiring success
    story here <strong style="color: green;">Kushi Yogalaya</strong>.</li>
    <li>Like me, you can also write a self-help book. If the content is useful and
    if you do little marketing, you can fetch some money every month.
    Check <strong style="color: green;">Amazon KDP</strong> for more details.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>2 - Zero Debts</h3>
    <p>
    If you have a monthly commitment (EMI) towards any loan, this will
    add extra pressure to your Trading career as you have to generate this
    amount every month.
    Sometimes, there will be no opportunities in the market, or if you fail to
    make money in the market, extra pressure will be created in your mind,
    which impacts trading decisions.
    Hence, it is better to clear all your pending loans before starting to think
    of trading as a full-time business.
    </p>

    <h3>3 - Savings</h3>
    <p>
    One should save enough money to run the family for at least one year.
    Suppose if you need Rs.1,00,000 (or 2000 USD approx.) per month to
    look after all the expenses in your family, then you have to save Rs.
    12,00,000 (or 24,000 USD approx.) before taking up trading as a full-time
    business.
    This amount is excluded from your Trading capital, which you require
    for your trading. In this case, your trading results will not impact your
    mindset, and also, you will not get any emotional pressure from your family
    members.
    </p>

    <h3>4 - Trading Results</h3>
    <p>
    Trading looks very simple when a beginner makes some quick money.
    However, one should realize that the market conditions are always dynamic
    and it requires enormous skills to make consistent money in the market.
    So it is better to measure our trading success before we take the extreme
    step of becoming a full-time trader. It is a good idea to consider yourself as a
    successful trader when:
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>(I) you make at least six months of your current salary from trading
    profits in total, and</li>
    <li>(II) you make profits for three consecutive months in trading.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5 - Trading Capital</h3>
    <p>
    Only the above parameters are not sufficient to enable you to quit your
    current job and jump into trading. One should have adequate Trading capital
    to make profits in the market.
    If you can make 10% returns every month (10% per month is good
    returns as per any trading expert), you need a minimum of Rs. 10,00,000 (or
    20,000 USD approx.) as your trading capital if your monthly expense is
    around Rs. 1,00,000 (or 2000 USD approx.).
    </p>
    <h3>A Small Caution</h3>
    <p>
    One of the most significant advantages and disadvantages of full-time
    trading is 'You are the Boss' in your work, and you don't have to report to
    anybody. Usually, we are used to the 'Reporting' style of work, and this
    freedom may work against you if you don't have serious trading plans and
    goals. One can keep the following points in their mind when they become a
    full-time trader:
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>One should not take breaks in the trading days for any reason. Because
    opportunities may come at any moment, one should be ready to grab these
    opportunities on all trading days.</li>
    <li>Your laziness can cost you dearly in the market. Trading is your
    business, and you should be ready like a business person before the open of
    the market. You have to finish your exercise, meditation, bath, etc., before
    looking at the market open. If you cannot concentrate on the market at home,
    hire a single-seat desk in any office (nowadays, you can hire a single-seat
    desk for monthly rent, including Internet connection, maintenance at the
    desk, coffee, etc.).</li>
    <li>All successful traders maintain a 'Trading Journal', and hence it is a
    good idea to log all your trades with Entry, exit, S.L. price, etc. You should
    review these trades on a periodical basis and evaluate your trading skills.</li>
    <li>Usually, in all other professions, we will have a supporting
    environment. However, in trading, it isn't easy to have such an environment.
    Hence, one should develop a circle of profitable traders and be involved in
    monthly gatherings or other meetings. If possible, attend major events on
    Trading like Trader's Carnival, a seminar conducted by experts, etc.</li>
    </ul>
