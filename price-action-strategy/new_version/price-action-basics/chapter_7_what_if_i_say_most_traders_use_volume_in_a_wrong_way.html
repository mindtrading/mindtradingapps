    <h3>What if I Say Most Traders Use VOLUME in a Wrong Way?</h3>
    <p>In price action trading, only two things are important – 1) Price and 2) Volume.</p>
    <p>Till the previous chapter, we studied ‘price,’ and in this chapter, we will explore ‘volume.’</p>
    <p>I have not used the above title to catch your eye, but I have kept it because that is the fact.</p>
    <p>This chapter has two modules – 1) Volume Analysis Basic and 2) Volume Analysis Advanced.</p>
    <p>I am sharing basic aspects of volume analysis in the beginning because advanced volume analysis will raise many questions in your mind, and it will shake the idea or foundations of volume principles.</p>
    <p>So, beginners and intermediate level traders will benefit from the basic information about volume. More experienced traders will benefit more from the advanced concepts.</p>

    <h3>Volume Analysis Basics</h3>
    <p>‘Volume’ is nothing but the total number of buyers and sellers exchanging shares over a particular period.</p>
    <p>For example, if the volume of XYZ stock on one trading day is 1 million, it means a group of people sold 1 million XYZ shares and another group of people have bought 1 million shares on the same day.</p>
    <p>Traders should use ‘Volume’ as a confirmation tool and should never use it independently to initiate a trade (ignoring the ‘Price’).</p>

    <p>The above table explains the price-volume co-relationship.</p>
    <p>When the price is increasing along with an increase in volume, it is
        bullish in nature. But when the price is increasing with a decrease in volume,
        it is not bullish in nature. That does not mean we should look to short it
        because volume can go up again after the consolidation.</p>

    <p>When the price is falling along with an increase in volume, it is bearish
        in nature. But when the price is falling with a decrease in volume, it is not
        bearish in nature.</p>

     <p>Image 7.1 – Increase in Price and Volume</p>

     <p>The above image shows the case where both price and volume are
        increasing simultaneously. Whenever we see this kind of scenario, there is a
        higher probability of price going upside.</p>

     <p>Image 7.2 – Volume confirmation for a long trade in USD-CAD</p>
     <p>Image 7.2 shows an example of a long trade in the trend following
        technique.</p>
        <p>The prior trend is upside; there is a healthy pullback, and also, the price
    has shown a bullish harami pattern at the support trend line. So from the
    ‘Price’ perspective, it looks good to take a long trade.
    </p>

    <p>Now observe ‘Volume.’ Every increase in price also witnessed an
        increase in the volume, and every decrease in price, followed by a decrease
        in volume. Hence, it looks good for the long trade.</p>

    <p>Image 7.3 – Volume confirmation is missing in USD-JPY</p>


    <p>The above image shows a similar example for a long trade in the trend
        following technique.</p>
    
    <p>The prior trend is up, there is a healthy pullback, and the price has
        displayed a bullish harami pattern at the support trend line.
        However, if you look at the price-volume co-relationship, it tells another
        story. It has witnessed a volume spike during the downswings and not seen a
        surge in volume in upswings.
        </p>
        <p>It indicates the presence of serious sellers. Hence, it is not good to opt for
            a long trade even though the price has shown a bullish harami pattern at the
            support trend line.</p>

    <p>Image 7.4 – Volume confirmation for a Breakout Trade in USD-INR</p>

   <p>Image 7.4 shows an example of a breakout trade in USD-INR.
    Look at the price-volume co-relationship carefully. Every price rise has
    witnessed increased volume, and every correction in price has caught less
    volume. This criteria is good for bulls and acts as confirmation from the
    volume side to opt for a long trade.</p>

     <p>Image 7.5 – Volume confirmation for a Short Trade in TATA Motors</p>

    <p>Image 7.5 shows an example of a short trade in Tata Motors.
        The prior trend is down; there is a healthy bounce, and the price also
        displays a few bearish candlestick patterns such as bearish harami and pin
        bar at the resistance trend line.</p>

        <p>Now carefully look at the price-volume co-relationship. Every fall in
            price has witnessed an increase in volume, and every price rise has shown
            less volume. Hence, the volume indicates the strong presence of bears.
            Therefore, it is a good idea to opt for a short trade.</p>


         <h2>Volume Analysis Advanced</h2>
    <p>I want to give a small caution before I proceed with this part. If you are a beginner, please skip this part and go to the next chapter directly. You can use the concepts from volume analysis basic, and you can read this part after getting some experience.</p>
    <p>The traditional idea or understanding of price-volume co-relationship doesn’t work all the time, and it misses many important aspects.</p>
    <p>For example, traders often say that the ‘price’ will go up only with an increase in ‘volume.’ However, in my opinion, this idea is not entirely correct. The ‘price’ can go up further with more volume, it can go up with medium volume, and it can also go up with less volume.</p>
    <p>Do you think my idea is rubbish? Let’s look at some charts.</p>

            <p>Image 7.6 – Price-Volume co-relationship in USD-CAD</p>
            <p>In image 7.6, the price has gone up from Oct to Dec end. But where is
                the increase in volume? The volume is almost the same as compared to the
                average volume. Isn’t it?<br>
                Do you have a tough time digesting this fact? Let’s look at the below
                chart.
                </p>

            <p>Image 7.7 – Price-Volume co-relationship in USD-INR</p>

            <p>Image 7.7 is a USD-INR chart in which the price has gone up from 64.25
                to 68.75. But look at the volume part; it’s less than the average volume. Isn’t
                it?</p>

          
            <p>It clearly shows that the price can go up even with less volume.</p>

        <p>Image 7.8 – Price-Volume co-relationship in Facebook</p>

       
            <p>Image 7.8 shows one more example in which the price has gone up
                without an increase in volume.<br>
                At least by now, do you agree that the price can go up with more volume,
                or medium volume, or less volume?<br>
                If you still have a tough time accepting and digesting this fact, please
                visit some charts and observe the ‘Volume’ part in the upswings of the price</p>

            <p>Image 7.9 – Price-Volume co-relationship in LIC</p>


            <p>Now a simple chart to test your understanding.</p>
            <p>Observe image 7.9. A resistance trend line, and price opened and closed above the trend line with a significant volume spike.</p>
            <p>What is your view on this chart? Bullish? Bearish? Or no clarity?</p>
            <p>If your answer is ‘Bullish,’ then there is a serious mismatch between your understanding and reality. Let me explain in detail.</p>
            <p>Do you agree that the resistance zone belongs to sellers?</p>
            <p>Besides, sellers should be absent at the resistance zone to give further move on the upside.</p>
            <p>But look at the breakout candle carefully. It has a selling wick that is about 50% of the body. It means 50% of them are sellers.</p>
            <p>You have developed a bullish view after looking at the big green color volume spike. Isn’t it?</p>
            <p>But this volume spike indicates that 50% are sellers. This is where the analysis of many traders goes wrong.</p>
            <p>Let’s study one more example.</p>
        
            <p><img src="https://mindtradingapps.pages.dev/price-action-strategy/new_version/price-action-basics/images/87.webp"/></p>

            <p>Image 7.10 – Price-Volume co-relationship in Tata Motors</p>
            
            <p>Look at image 7.10 carefully; and what is your view on the volume
                spikes ‘A’ and ‘B’?</p>

            <p>The price candle corresponding to the ‘A’ volume spike contains a
                buying wick of 40%; hence there are 40% buyers in the ‘A’ volume spike.
                The price candle corresponding to the ‘B’ volume spike contains a
                buying wick of over 60%; hence there are 60% buyers in the ‘B’ volume
                spike.</p>
            <p>After clearing this major misconception, I can explain how I analyze the
                price-volume relationship.</p>

        <p>Image 7.11 – Price-Volume Advanced Analysis</p>

    <p>Earlier, we have learnt to use ‘price’ to decide whether the support or resistance will hold or not. Now we will explore the same through ‘volume,’ and later, we can combine both ‘Price’ and ‘Volume’ to make a trading decision.</p>
    
    <p>Image 7.11 shows a daily chart of L.T, and now the price is near the support trend line. To decide whether the support will hold or not through ‘volume,’ we need to analyze the significant volume spikes.</p>
    <p>I have marked five significant volume spikes on the chart, and I analyze these spikes as below:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Spike 1</strong> – It looks bullish, but there is a selling wick and also the price fell later. Hence, I mark this spike as bearish.</li>
        <li><strong>Spike 2</strong> – There is no buying wick and also the price fell later. Hence, I mark this spike as bearish.</li>
        <li><strong>Spike 3</strong> – Again there is no buying wick and also the price fell later. Hence, I mark this spike as bearish.</li>
        <li><strong>Spike 4</strong> – Not much selling wick and price has gone up later. Hence, I mark this spike as bullish.</li>
        <li><strong>Spike 5</strong> – This spike is debatable. It has both buying and selling wicks. But the price fell after 2 days. Hence, I mark this spike as Neutral.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Now there are 5 volume spikes in total. Among 5, there are 3 bearish volume spikes, 1 bullish spike, and 1 neutral spike. Hence, there is a high probability of price breaking the support trend line.</p>
    <p>You can look at the result in the below image.</p>
