    <h3 style="color: green;">What is Price Action?</h3>

<p> 'Price Action' means price fluctuations of a stock or index in the given
    market.
    On any trading day, from open to close, the price keeps on changing. This
    variation is nothing but price action.</p>

    <h3 style="color: green;">What is Price Action Trading?</h3>
    <p>'Price Action Trading' is a trading concept in which a trader reads the
    chart, and makes subjective trading decisions based on the price movements,
    rather than relying on technical indicators or any other factors.
    In simple words, traders use only 'Price' and 'Volume' to make any
    trading decision.</p>

    <p>If you look at the above image, only a price chart is used to make trading decisions. Traders can also use 'Volume' information along with the 'Price' chart to plan a trade. It is nothing but 'Price Action Trading.'</p>
    <p>The three essential components of trading are (in the same order):</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Price—it advertises all the opportunities.</li>
        <li>Time—it regulates all the opportunities.</li>
        <li>Volume—it measures the success or failure of all the advertised opportunities.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Volume is essential as 80% of the trading volume is given by 20% of the big players. Hence, 'Price' and 'Volume' information is more than enough to succeed with positional Trading, BTST trading, and long-term trading. One has to master the 'Time' parameter if one is interested in short term trading such as Intraday trading or scalping.</p>
    <h3>How to use Price Action Trading?</h3>
    <p>Traders need to spend some time getting a fair idea on price action trading as it will not generate any buy or sell signals like other indicators.</p>

    <h3>It involves three steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Identify key price levels using any method like drawing trend lines, pivot points, supply-demand zones, round numbers, etc.</li>
        <li>Planning an 'Entry', based on the candlestick patterns at key price levels (for beginners) or using raw price action concepts (for experts).</li>
        <li>Similar to Step-2, planning an 'Exit' based on the candlestick patterns or raw price action at key price levels.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>When 'Left' became 'Right' for a Shooter!</h3>
    <p>Karoly Takacs was born in Budapest and serving the Hungarian Army. From his childhood days, he was interested only in one sport, which is shooting. His main ambition in life was to win an Olympic gold medal for his country.</p>
    <p>By 1936, he was already a world-class shooter. But he didn't get a chance to participate in the 1936 Summer Olympics as he was as a sergeant, and only commissioned officers were allowed to compete in the Olympics games.</p>
    <p>Takacs didn't lose hope, and he kept on practicing his favorite sport. Fortunately for him, after the 1936 Summer Olympics, this restriction on non-officers was removed by the Hungarian army, and hence he was free to participate in the 1940 Tokyo Olympics.</p>
    <p>So, he started practicing even harder this time. He used to spend many hours every day to practice his shooting. But life had other plans for him. In 1938, during a military drill, a grenade exploded in his hand, and he lost half of his forearm.</p>
    <p>Can you imagine his situation now? All his dreams were shattered. He was in the hospital for over a month. When he came back home, he didn't give up practice. He started everything from the beginning, but this time using his left hand!</p>

    <p>Apart from eating and sleeping for some time, he spent most of his time practicing. After a few months of training with his left hand, he turned up for the Hungarian National Championships in 1939.</p>
    <p>All the other shooters assumed he had come to watch the competition and offered their sympathy. But he said, 'I am not here for your sympathetic words, I am here to compete with all of you!'. He secured first place in the competition, to everyone's surprise, and he was automatically eligible for the next Olympics.</p>
    <p>Once again, life had other plans for him. Due to the outbreak of the Second World War, both the 1940 and 1944 Olympics were canceled. He was aged 34 in 1944. For most Olympic athletes, 30s is a retirement age (even today!).</p>
    <p>Surprisingly, Takacs didn't give up his training, and once again, he was eligible for the 1948 London Olympics. He was already 38 at that time.</p>
    <p>During those years, Carlos Enrique Diaz Saenz Valiente was the world record holder, and he asked Takacs why he is here in London. To this question, Takacs's answer is simple and clear – 'I am here to learn!'</p>
    <p>What happened next should be written in golden letters in the history books. Not only Takacs won the Gold medal, but he also bettered the world record by 10 points!</p>
    <p>Takacs appeared again in the 1952 Helsinki Olympics and won the gold medal once again at the age of 42! Valiente (his competitor and previous world record holder) showered compliments on him and said, 'You have learned more than enough; now it's time to teach me!'.</p>
    
    <h3>Now for all traders, who have lost money in trading, there are 2 takeaways from this story:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>There is no such thing as failure in life. There will be difficult situations that test our character. So, if you have lost money in trading, then accept it. If you don't accept it, your mind will not be open to learning. The loss is part of the game, and we are not supposed to make the same mistakes in this business.</li>
        <li>You have lost money because you failed to display persistent effort with one trading concept. A basic understanding of 10 different trading concepts will not fetch the money in trading. But a deep understanding of one trading system, along with proper risk management, can give success in trading.</li>
    </ol>
