   <strong style="color: red;"> FIBONACCI TRADING WITH PRICE ACTION IN CHAPTER</strong><br><br>
    Speaking for myself, one thing I keep noticing in price action is that it follows Fibonacci levels. Not always, but
    when it does, certain market movements can bring you a lot of money quickly. The secret is to employ reverse
    candlesticks to combine Fibonacci with price action.<br>

   <span><h6>But first, here is a quick explanation of the Fibonacci retracement tool in case you've never heard of it.

   <strong style="color: green;"> The Fibonacci Retracement Tool: What Is It?</strong><br><br>


    This tool is a collection or arrangement of numbers that was discovered in the 13th century by a man by the name of
    Leonardo Fibonacci. (He's been long gone.) No need to go into unnecessary detail regarding the calculation of those
    statistics.<br><br>
    In technical analysis, the vertical distance between two extreme points on your forex chart (often a large peak and
    trough) is divided by the important Fibonacci ratios of 23.6%, 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%, and 100%. Horizontal lines are
    drawn after these levels have been determined and are then utilized to determine potential support and resistance
    levels.<br><br>
    The 50% and 61.8% fib levels are the two that I use the most frequently. I truly don't think about the others at all.
    The Fibonacci tool has an icon if you are using the MetaTrader 4 trading platform, as demonstrated in the chart
    below:

   <strong> Three Significant Reason for Fibonacci Retracement Tool</strong><br>
    ● In a downtrend, the price will move back up (upswing, remember?) after having fallen for a while. You can assess
    or forecast potential price reversal locations or levels using the Fibonacci retracement tool.<br>

    ● In a similar vein, when price moves in modest downtrends (downswings) during an upswing, you can use the
    Fibonacci retracement tool to identify prospective price levels or reversal places.<br>

    ● They truly make a potent combo when paired with price action, support and resistance levels, and other factors,
    and they do provide highly profitable trading signals. This explains a phenomenon called "price Confluence." Later,
    I'll expand on that.<br><br>

  <strong>  Using Fibonacci Tool on MT4</strong><br>
    Actually, there are only 3 easy steps to this process:<br>
    Number 1 = Locate the peak (the upswing point/resistance level) and the trough (the downswing point/support
    level)<br>
    Number 2 = On your chart, click the Fibonacci tool icon.<br>
    All of the subsequent procedures involve clicking and dragging.<br>
    Number 3i = To analyze a market in a downtrend, click first on the peak you wish to analyze from, then drag down
    to the low point where the price reversed, and then release.<br>

    Number 3ii = Click and drag on the trough of an uptrending market first, then drag to the high, and then release.
    Drawing Fibonacci retracement levels on your charts is quite straightforward.<br>

    The price produced a peak on the chart below, fell after finding support, formed a trough, and then rose again.

        It begins to gradually show signs of losing the upward momentum at about the 50% fib level. Additionally, you can
        see the bearish spinning top candlestick, which might have provided a hint to sell.<br><br>

       <strong> Can you purchase or sell as soon as the price reaches these levels without price action solely based on fib figures
        like 50% or 61.8%?</strong><br><br>

        Well, I believe that both you and other traders can engage in that activity. But such strategy does not appeal to me
        personally. For trade entry, I prefer to use a combination of Fibonacci and reverse candlesticks, trend lines, support
        & resistance levels, etc.<br><br>

        Let's research the past... Here's an illustration of how to use price action in an upswing and Fibonacci to trade. Take
        note of the spinning top candlestick, which might have served as a buy signal, just at the 50% level:

      <p>You can see that this is not a difficult task, do you not? very basic trading setups. Your risks are negligible in comparison to the potential rewards.</p>
