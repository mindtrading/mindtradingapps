    Let's examine price in greater detail right now. This information is for beginners. Those who already know can skip
    this part to the next chapter. Whats Price?</p>

    <p>
        Price is the value assigned to a specific instrument, typically in monetary terms, and it depends on supply and
demand to maintain its worth.

    </p>

    <p>
        ● If there is a greater demand, prices rise as more merchants begin to buy, pushing up prices.<br><br>
        ● Your price charts show demand zones at support levels; this is where buyers enter to start purchasing and raise
        prices.<br><br>
        ● Price drops when there is an oversupply since there are more sellers than buyers.<br><br>
        ● On your charts, supply zones are on and near resistance levels when sellers enter and force prices down because
        there aren't enough buyers.<br><br>
        You only ever see the dynamics of supply and demand at work when you open up your charts!
        What does a rising market tell you about supply and demand at that point? It implies that there is high demand for
        such instrument.<br>
        Or what if marketing is declining? What would it indicate about supply and demand? There is a large supply and
        little demand.<br><br>
        Price, however, has another aspect—it also includes a temporal component.
        Therefore, a product's price now won't be the same price tomorrow, in a month, or in a year. The price fluctuates
        throughout time according to supply and demand.<br><br>
        But how can you depict the price's worth through time, which in turn reveals the forces of supply and demand?<br><br>
        You require line charts, candlesticks, and price bars. These are graphical and visual representations of pricing over
        time that tell you a tale about the forces of supply and demand over a specific time period, which might range from
        one minute to one month or year.
    </p>
   <strong> Line, Bar, and Candlestick Charts</strong><br><br>
    There are three main visual representations of price over time:<br><br>
    1. Bar Chart (as shown below) 
    <p><img src="https://mindtradingapps.pages.dev/price-action-strategy/new_version/price-action-profit-kit/images/img-7.webp"/></p>

    The bar chart resembles a simple "stick" or bar with two little knobs on either side. The opening price is indicated on
    the left knob, and the closing price is indicated on the right knob.<br>
    The wick is located at both the upper and lower ends. The highest level or point on the upper end of the wick
    represents the highest price that was ever recorded during a specific timeframe or period, while the lowest level or
    point on the lower wick represents the lowest price ever recorded during the same time frame or period.<br><br>
    2. Similar information is presented in the bar chart above and in the candlestick chart below:
    <p><img src="https://mindtradingapps.pages.dev/price-action-strategy/new_version/price-action-profit-kit/images/img-8.webp"/></p>
    Candlestick chart, in a lay mans term: it would be like covering the bar chart's skeleton with a body.
    <p><img src="https://mindtradingapps.pages.dev/price-action-strategy/new_version/price-action-profit-kit/images/img-9.webp"/></p>

    The candlestick chart has a body, but the bar chart has not, and that is the only distinction between the two types of
    charts.<br><br>
    The bearish candlestick is most frequently identified by its red color, which signifies the price opened high and
    ended down. The precise opposite, a green candlestick, is a bullish candlestick.<br><br>
    3. Although not completely transparent, the line chart (as seen below) conveys the same price information over time.
    <p><img src="https://mindtradingapps.pages.dev/price-action-strategy/new_version/price-action-profit-kit/images/img-10.webp"/></p>
    One of the least preferred charts for trading is the line chart. The line on a chart is easily drawn by joining the
    closing, high, or low price, depending on the type of chart.<br><br>
    Line charts can be helpful for determining long-term trends and looking at the "larger picture," but they just are
    unable to provide the same level of detail as a candlesticks chart.<br><br>
    The most common of these three is the candlestick chart, followed by the bar chart. From this point forward, my
    attention will be solely on candlestick charts, however I may accidentally refer to candlestick patterns as "bars"; just
    keep that in mind.<br>
    Since candlestick (charts) is the mainstay of price action traders, I will focus more on it in this book.<br><br>
   <strong>The candlestick</strong> 
    The candlestick chart, sometimes known as the Japanese candlestick chart, has its roots in Japan.<br><br>
    The color of the candlestick chart indicates whether the price was up or down within a specific timeframe, indicating
    whether the candlesticks are <span style="color: green;"> bullish </span>or <span style="color: red;"> bearish</span>.<br><br>
<strong>
    These days, the majority of traders designate <span style="color: green;">green candlesticks</span> as bullish and <span style="color: red;">red candlesticks</span> as bearish. And
    for my own personal benefit, I enjoy it that way.<br><br>
    
</strong>

    Some trading platforms have options that let you pick any color you wish for the candlesticks. You can turn a bullish
    candlestick pink if you're a lady! And to Purple, a bearish candlestick! (But since I was born and now that I am
    getting old, I have never seen a purple and pink candlestick.)<br><br>
    
    A bullish candlestick is demonstrated by the one below.
    <p><img src="https://mindtradingapps.pages.dev/price-action-strategy/new_version/price-action-profit-kit/images/img-11.webp"/></p>

    ● A bullish candlestick merely indicates that the price opened lower and closed higher after a predetermined amount
    of time, such as one minute, five minutes, an hour, or a day.<br><br>
    ● The candle body displays the price movement between the opening and closing prices. The lengthier the body, the
    greater the upward movement of the price since opening. The exact opposite is true the shorter the candle body.<br><br>
    ● The high represents the highest price that was realized at that point in time.<br><br>
    ● The low represents the lowest value that was obtained at that point in time.<br><br>


   <span style="color: green;"> These candlesticks below, which are all bullish in nature and reflect an overall rise in the timeframe each
    candlestick was created. This means that their initial (opening) prices were lower than their closing values.</span>
    <p><img src="https://mindtradingapps.pages.dev/price-action-strategy/new_version/price-action-profit-kit/images/img-12.webp"/></p>
    A bearish candlestick merely denotes an opening price that was high and a closing price that was lower.
    <p><img src="https://mindtradingapps.pages.dev/price-action-strategy/new_version/price-action-profit-kit/images/img-13.webp"/></p>
    These subsequent candlesticks are all bearish candlesticks, indicating a downtrend as the opening price was higher
    than the closing price.

   <strong style="color: green;"> Knowing the Selling and Buying Pressure on Candlesticks</strong><br><br>
    Are you aware that some bullish candlesticks are considered to be bearish and vise versa? You must comprehend
    purchasing and selling pressure in order to fully grasp this idea.<br><br>
    Each candlestick that forms gives you a tale about the conflict between the bulls and the bears—who was dominant,
    who prevailed in the end, who is waning, etc. Any candlestick you see is a reflection of everything. You can learn
    about the pressure on buying and selling from the candlestick's body length and its shadow (or wick).<br><br>
    Take a look at the two chart below, for instance:
    <p><img src="https://mindtradingapps.pages.dev/price-action-strategy/new_version/price-action-profit-kit/images/img-15.webp"/> <img src="https://mindtradingapps.pages.dev/price-action-strategy/new_version/price-action-profit-kit/images/16.webp"/></p>

    Observe the first green candlestick on the left chart; you'd say that one represents a bullish signal. Yes?. However, it
    has a very short body and a very long wick (tail) as is evident.<br><br>
    It indicates that the sellers (bears) were in control. Despite being a bullish candlestick, if this one were to appear
    after reaching a resistance level, it would be viewed as a negative indicator.<br><br>

   <strong> Now you may use the same reasoning to read the stories being told by each of the other candlesticks up top.</strong><br><br>
    ● If the length of the upper wick is very long, it simply denotes that there is strong selling pressure. It indicates that
    after the price opened and was driven upward by buyers, sellers entered the market and drove the price back down.<br>
    ● If the lower wick is particularly long, it indicates strong purchasing pressure. The price was lowered by the sellers,
    but when buyers entered, the price was raised.<br>
    ● The lower wick's shortness indicates that there isn't much purchasing pressure.<br>
    ● If the upper wick is short, there is very little selling pressure, according to this rule.<br><br>

   <strong style="color: green;"> What About The Candlesticks' Body Length?</strong><br><br>

    The lengthier the candle's body, the stronger the purchasing or selling pressure.<br><br>

    A candlestick with a short body shows limited price movement and thus less buying or selling pressure.

    <p><img src="https://mindtradingapps.pages.dev/price-action-strategy/new_version/price-action-profit-kit/images/17.webp"/></p>

    ● The candles will occasionally have very lengthy bodies but no upper or lower shadows. Although these are a
    stronger indicator of bullish or bearish market emotion than ordinary candlesticks, they are nevertheless understood
    in the same way.<br><br>
    ● When a candle is bullish, prices never fall below the open. Price never trades higher than the open when a bearish
    candle is present. See image below:<br><br>
    ●<img src="https://mindtradingapps.pages.dev/price-action-strategy/new_version/price-action-profit-kit/images/18.webp"/>
    We have just examined individual candlesticks up to this point. What happens if you mix multiple candlesticks?
    What does it demonstrate?<br><br>
    ● Well, one crucial thing that collection of candlesticks can demonstrate to you is the strength or weakness of a
    bullish or bearish swing.<br><br>
    ● They can also indicate whether a bullish or bearish move is losing strength.<br><br>
    ● Momentum is the term used to characterize such a circumstance.<br><br>
    The chart below displays three bearish candlesticks in a downtrend, each with a dwindling body and length an. When this occurs during a downward trend, it is one indication that the trend may be waning. You should pay
    attention if this occurs around support levels, and you should also keep an eye out for bullish reversal candlesticks,
    which will give you the courage to buy!<br><br>
   
   <strong> Bearish Momentum Decreasing</strong>

   <p><img src="https://mindtradingapps.pages.dev/price-action-strategy/new_version/price-action-profit-kit/images/18.webp"/></p>
   You can see an illustration of decreased downward momentum when price approaches a support level in the chart
   below. As price approaches the support level, the candlesticks start to get shorter, as opposed to the earlier
   candlesticks' tendency to be longer:<br><br>
   The following chart displays three bullish candles, each with a dwindling length, in an uptrend. When this occurs
   around resistance levels during an uptrend, you should pay attention. Bearish reversal candlestick patterns should
   also be on the lookout for. Your ability to sell will increase as a result.<br><br>

   <strong> Bullish Momentum Decreasing</strong><br><br>
   <p><img src="https://mindtradingapps.pages.dev/price-action-strategy/new_version/price-action-profit-kit/images/19.webp"/></p>

   <span style="color: red;"> Here is an illustration of a bullish momentum decline in an upswing
    followed by a price decline:</span><br><br>
    On the chart above, did you see how the bullish candlesticks started out with increasing lengths, then gradually
    shrank as the price rose before making a significant downward move?<br><br>
    Price momentum is exactly that. You must keep this in mind each time you look at your charts. Very significant!<br><br>
    <strong style="color: red;"> Wicks of candlesticks</strong><br><br>
    Candlestick wicks and bodies both convey a narrative. A line that runs above and below the candlestick's body is
    referred to as a wick and is also known as the shadow or tail of the candlestick.<br><br>
   
    <span style="color: green;"> What Do Candle Wicks, Shadows, And Tails Mean, And How Do They Form?</span><br><br>

    ● Well, a shift in market attitude is what causes them to form. ● For an upper wick, price is rising before traders
    alter market perception and sellers push price downward before the open. The higher shadow is created in this
    manner.<br><br>
    ● For the lower shadow, the price is declining, but as the market sentiment shifts, the bulls push the price up toward
    the close. A lower wick or shadow is created in this manner.<br><br>

   <span style="color: red;"> Greater changes in market sentiment are indicated by longer wicks.</span>
   <p><img src="https://mindtradingapps.pages.dev/price-action-strategy/new_version/price-action-profit-kit/images/20.webp"/></p>

   <span style="color: green;"> a long tail on the bottom part of a candlestick tells us that the market made a significant fall then quickly
    retreated from this price level. This is often seen as a bullish signal.</span>
    <p><img src="https://mindtradingapps.pages.dev/price-action-strategy/new_version/price-action-profit-kit/images/21.webp"/></p>

    <span style="color: red;"> a long tail on the top part of a candlestick tells us that the market made a significant rise then quickly
    retreated and fell from this price level. This is often seen as a bearish signal.</span><br><br>

   <strong> What Function Do Candlestick Wicks Serve?</strong><br><br>
    ● Candlestick wicks with protracted upper shadows are sometimes seen when an uptrend is waning.<br><br>
    ● Long lower shadows appear as the downturn begins to wane.
