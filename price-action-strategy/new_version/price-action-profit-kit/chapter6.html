 <strong style="color: green;"> Understanding market Waves (Swings)</strong>  <br><br>
    Market price fluctuates in waves. A price swing occurs when the market behaves like a wave.
    Therefore, during an uptrend, price will experience higher highs and lower lows, as demonstrated in the following 
    chart:<br><br>

    <p>Therefore, during an uptrend, price fluctuates just like the chart below: Additionally, price will be making lower
        highs and lower lows during a downtrend:</p>

            Why is Understanding Market Price Swing Is So Important<br><br>

            You must comprehend this idea of how price moves in swings if you want to become a really excellent price action 
            trader. This is especially true if you trade using a swing or trend strategy.<br><br>

          <strong>  Because if you don't comprehend how pricing fluctuates in swings, you'll wind up doing the following: 
        </strong><br><br>
            
            ➢  You'll place your trade at the exact incorrect time! For instance, if the
            market is in a slump, you would sell when it was just starting to rise! This is bad!<br><br>

            ➢  Which indicates that you will be stopped out or that you need to place a significant stop loss. If you size your 
            positions depending on the stop loss distance, a large stop loss does not necessarily translate into a large risk. 
            However, if you don't, you are taking a big risk.<br><br>

            ➢  If your stop loss is quite high, it will take some time for the market to move down before you can start making 
            money on your trade.<br><br>

          <strong> Here's an illustration of what I mean: </strong> </p>

          <P>It's not a great scenario to be in, in all honesty. Every trader wants their trades to start making money as soon as they
            place it. However, as far as we are aware, the market is not like that; occasionally, things like that do occur but often
            it doesn’t. That is how the market operates.<br><br>
            
            In an uptrend, you should therefore try to buy when the market is in downswing. In a downtrend you ought to be
            trying to sell at an upswing.<br><br>

           <strong> Utilizing price action (reversal candlesticks) is the best strategy for doing that:</strong></P>
