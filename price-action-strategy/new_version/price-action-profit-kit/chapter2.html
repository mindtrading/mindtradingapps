    Price action, in this
    regard, represents a mass psychology or collective human behavior.<br><br>
   <p style="color: red;"> I'll explain. </p>
    All humans have evolved to react in particular ways to specific situations. Additionally, this can be observed in the
    world of trading:<br><br>
    The way that many traders think and act results in recurring price patterns that may be seen and then predicted with
    some degree of accuracy as to which direction the market will most likely go.<br><br>
    For instance, if you notice a significant resistance level, price may hit it and form a bearish reversal candlestick
    pattern known as a "shooting star." After that, you can predict that Price would decline with more certainty.<br><br>
    <p style="color: red;"> Why ?</p>
    
    Because so many traders are keeping an eye on that resistance level, they are all aware that price has previously
    rejected it on one or two occasions, indicating that it is a resistance level, and they can also see the bearish reversal
    candlestick formation... and what do you suppose they'll be waiting to do?<br><br>
    1. They will be ready to sell when they arrive. thousands of sell orders, some
    tiny and others large, instead of just one.<br><br>
    2. However, the trader who bought at a low price and now that the price is rising toward the resistance level, that is
    where most of their take profit levels are, is on the other side of the coin. Therefore, whenever they take their profits
    around resistance levels, there will be more sellers than buyers. The price is forced back down from a resistance
    level when the balance shifts in favor of the sellers.<br><br>
    Since price movement is a reflection of general psychology. The actions of traders affect the markets.
    Price action trading is therefore about utilizing those patterns to gain an understanding of the psychology of the
    market and turn a profit as a result.<br><br>
    Price action trading can be divided into two categories: 100 percent Pure Price Action Trading and Not So Pure
    Price Action Trading. I'll explain.<br><br>
   <strong>Price Action Trading (Pure)</strong> <br><br>
    Trading exclusively on price action is referred to as pure price action trading. No clues other than pure price activity.<br><br>
    <strong>  Price Action Trading (Not Totally Pure)</strong> <br><br>
    When this occurs, price action trading is utilized in conjunction with other indications, and these additional
    indicators are a part of the price action trading system. These indicators might be oscillators like the stochastic
    indicator and CCI or trend indicators like moving averages. (Please refrain from searching for stochastic indicators
    and CCI!)<br><br>
    <strong>  Birth of Price Action Trading</strong> <br><br>
    Charles Dow was accorded to be the founder of Technical Analysis. He birthed the Dow Theory.
    The Dow Theory helps to understand the market behaviour and market trends. The first part of the theory speculates
    that market prices discredit everything. Hence, technical analyst utilize chart patterns and price chart to understand
    markets and are less concerned about the fundamental analysis of what makes the market move.<br><br>
    <p style="color: red;"> In chapter Four I will talk more about it where I will be discussing how trends starts and end and what trends
        are.</p><br><br>
