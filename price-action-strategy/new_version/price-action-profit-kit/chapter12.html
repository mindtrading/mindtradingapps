  <strong> Trendlines Trading with Price Action.</strong> <br><br>
    When the market is declining, it continuously travels lower while forming downward and upward swings.
    Similar to this, when the market is moving up, it will experience upswings and downswings as it does so.
    Trendlines can be created by connecting the peaks created by upswings and the troughs created by downswings.<br><br>

    ● And to draw a downward trendline for a market that is in a downtrend, you need at least two peaks.<br>

    ● And for a market in an uptrend, you need two troughs to draw an upward trendline.<br><br>
  
   <strong> DownTrendLines</strong><br><br>
    You may now draw a line connecting the peaks in a market that is downtrending to create a downward trendline.
    In other to enter a short trade, you must wait for the price to rise again and contact the trendline. If it happens, it may
    signal the beginning of a down swing.<br>
    With this trading strategy, bearish reversal candlesticks are strongly advised to be used as trade confirmation.

  <strong>  Upward TrendLines</strong><br><br>
    Connecting two troughs together will create an upward trendline when the market is in an uptrend. You may have a
    purchase setup later on when the price touches it.
    The live example of a long trade I made on the AUDNZD pair is shown in the chart below.

    I set my take profit target level at the 1.1290 level since I thought there would be a rise up to that price. This trade
    was obviously entered based on the setup in the daily timeframe, so if the market makes a nice move up, it might
    take a week or two before the profit target is reached. On the other hand, if price breaks the trendline and I get
    stopped out, I might be able to walk away with some profits when my trailing stop is hit.<br><br>


    However, the price breached that upward trendline the following day, and I was stopped out at a loss. However,
    there is a problem with a trade like that. With a possible payout of more than three times what I risked for this trade, my stop loss is set very close. Here is the timeline of events:

    You should execute your buy/long trades using the signal of bullish reversal candlesticks, which I highly advise.
    Here, I'm not trying to glorify price action trading. Losses similar to what I've shown you will occur.<br><br>
 
 <strong> But consider this...<br>
    I would have gained far more profits than losses had the price gone in the direction I predicted. The benefit of
    price action trading is that you might potentially make more money while taking on less risk.</strong>  <br><br>

  <strong>  What occurs if the trendline crosses itself?</strong><br><br>
    When a trendline intersects, there are a few points to keep in mind:<br>
    ● The first is that it might indicate a shift in the trend.<br>
    ● (The second possibility is that the break may just be a false one, and price will quickly turn back in the original
    direction.


    There is one more thing to know about trendlines: if one of them is broken, you need to see whether you can draw
    another one above (or below) it. On
    any chart in any timeframe, there might be two or more upward trendlines or two or more downward trendlines at
    once. Therefore, even if the price moves past the first trendline, it still has to pass through the second, third and so
    on.<br>
    If price is currently moving toward the second trendline above after you entered a sell trade on the first trendline but
    were stopped out with a loss, you should also consider selling if you see a bearish reversal candlestick signal.
    Here is an example of a trade I made on the AUDUSD pair in a comparable circumstance. see the chart (click to

    You'll see that I entered the first trade at the intersection of the first downward trendline and the second downward
    trendline based on a bearish harami and a spinning top pattern.<br>

    I made another short trade after spotting a shooting star. Clearly, a shooting star indicates how the price responded to
    the trendline. I had received a strong enough signal to go short.<br><br>
   <strong> These trendlines are important to be aware of on both the buy side and the sell side.</strong>
