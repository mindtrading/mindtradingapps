   <strong style="color: green;"> 9 Powerful Must Known Profitable Candle Stick Pattern</strong><br><br>

    There are many candlesticks, but only nine of them are essential for you to know. Why? Because they are extremely
    powerful and well-liked, why waste time on the others?<br>
    These candlesticks are excellent trade entry indications when they appear at support and resistance levels or
    Fibonacci levels.<br><br>

    1. The Doji Candlestick Pattern is the first: The doji candlestick patterns are made up of just one (single)
    candlestick. As seen below, there are 4 different varieties of doji candlesticks:  
    <p><img src="https://mindtradingapps.pages.dev/price-action-strategy/new_version/price-action-profit-kit/images/75.webp"/></p>

 <h5>   A. Depending on where it appears, the DOJI CROSS can be seen as either a bullish or bearish signal<br>
    B. When the GRAVESTONE DOJI forms in an uptrend or at a resistance level, it is regarded as a bearish
    reversal candlestick.<br>
    C. The DRAGONFLY DOJI candlestick pattern is seen as bullish when it appears during a decline or at a
    support level.<br>
    D. The LONG-LEGGED DOJi represents a period of indecision on the part of both bulls and bears, and it can be
    interpreted as either a bearish or a bullish signal depending on where it occurs (uptrend/resistance level=bearish
    signal, downtrend/support level=bullish signal).</h5>

 <strong style="color: green;">  2. Engulfing candlestick patterns are number two.</strong> <br><br>

    Two candlestick patterns form the engulfing patterns. In a bullish engulfing pattern, the initial candle will be bearish,
    followed by a second candle that is extremely bullish and that fully engulfs the previous candle.
    <p><img src="https://mindtradingapps.pages.dev/price-action-strategy/new_version/price-action-profit-kit/images/76.webp"/></p>
  <strong>  A = Bullish Engulfing.<br>
    B = Bearish Engulfing</strong><br><br>

    ● A bullish engulfing can indicate that a downtrend may be coming to an end when it forms near a downtrend or
    support level.<br>
    ● A bearish engulfing is a hint that an uptrend may be coming to an end when it forms during an uptrend or near a
    resistance level.<br>

  <strong style="color: red;">  3. Harami Candlestick Patterns</strong><br><br>

    Two candlestick patterns form the engulfing patterns.<br><br>

   <strong>Bullish Harami</strong> <br>

    This is a pattern made up of two candles. A extremely bearish candlestick forms the first candlestick, which is
    followed by a short, bullish candle that is entirely obscured by the previous candle's shadow. This will be your
    bullish (buy) indication if you observe it during a decline or in a zone of support.<br><br>
   
   
   <strong> Bearish Harami</strong><br>
    This pattern may be a bearish reversal signal that the uptrend is ending and that you should go short when it appears
    at a resistance level or during an uptrend (sell). It is also an opposite of bullish harami,

<p><img src="https://mindtradingapps.pages.dev/price-action-strategy/new_version/price-action-profit-kit/images/77.webp"/></p>

   <strong>   A = Bullish Harami <br>
        B = Bearish Harami</strong>  <br><br>

        The harami patterns are most easily recalled by picturing a pregnant woman with a kid in her womb:
        <p><img src="https://mindtradingapps.pages.dev/price-action-strategy/new_version/price-action-profit-kit/images/78.webp"/></p>


        <strong style="color: red;">  4. Candlestick pattern covered in dark clouds</strong><br><br>
        <p><img src="https://mindtradingapps.pages.dev/price-action-strategy/new_version/price-action-profit-kit/images/79.webp"/></p>

        The dark cloud is made up of 2 candlestick and it is a bearish reversal candlestick pattern. When the second candle
        forms, it tells a completely different story. Its bearish and it closes at around the same point as the first candlestick.
        The first candlestick is a bullish one, displaying a strong upward momentum.<br><br>

        Dark cloud cover candlestick patterns are a bearish reversal indication, and you should consider going short (sell)
        when you observe them in an uptrend or at a level of resistance.<br><br>

        <strong style="color: red;">  5. Candlestick Pattern With Piercing Line</strong><br><br>
     
        <p><img src="https://mindtradingapps.pages.dev/price-action-strategy/new_version/price-action-profit-kit/images/80.webp"/></p>

        Dark cloud cover is the opposite of the piercing line. This could be forming at a support level or during a downturn.
        The first candlestick offers a very gloomy story, but when the second candle forms, it provides a highly bullish
        story. This indicates that the bulls are strengthening and that the bears are losing momentum, which could lead to a
        rise in the market price.<br><br>

        The second bullish candlestick should end up near where the previous candlestick's mind-point was.
        Consider going long (buying) if you notice the piercing line pattern emerging at support levels or in a market that is
        downtrending because this could be a bullish reversal signal.<br><br>
        <strong style="color: red;">  6. Shooting Star Pattern</strong><br><br>
        <p><img src="https://mindtradingapps.pages.dev/price-action-strategy/new_version/price-action-profit-kit/images/81.webp"/></p>

        Given that they are so simple to identify on any chart, this is one of the most trustworthy
        candlesticks as well as one of the most widely used.<br><br>

        The shooting star is a single candlestick pattern that indicates a bearish reversal when it appears during an uptrend or
        at a level of resistance. As a result, you should aim to sell if it does so.<br><br>

      <span style="color: red;">  The shooting star is most time refereed to as the Bearish Hammer, Inverse Hammer Bearish Pin Bar or Inverted
        Hammer. They are all similar to the shooting star.</span><br><br>


       <strong style="color: red;"> 7. Pattern Of The Hammer Candlestick</strong><br><br>
        The hammer candlestick is a single candlestick design that is the reverse of the shooting star candlestick pattern and
        is seen as a bullish reversal candlestick pattern.<br>
        It has a short or no upper wick and a very long tail.
        <p><img src="https://mindtradingapps.pages.dev/price-action-strategy/new_version/price-action-profit-kit/images/82.webp"/></p>
        You should pay attention when it forms in a downturn or near support levels. Considering that this is a very likely
        bullish reversal candlestick pattern, you should be observing to buy long.<br><br>

        <strong style="color: red;">  8. Hanging Man Pattern </strong><br><br>

        What happens, then, if a candlestick that resembles a hammer appears during an uptrend? Is this signal still bullish?
        Anyways, this candlestick is a hanging man and does not indicate a bullish signal.
        This is how it appears:
        <p><img src="https://mindtradingapps.pages.dev/price-action-strategy/new_version/price-action-profit-kit/images/83.webp"/></p>
        The sole distinction between the hangging man and the hammer is that the latter must develop during an upward trend.
        <p><img src="https://mindtradingapps.pages.dev/price-action-strategy/new_version/price-action-profit-kit/images/84.webp"/></p>

        You should look to go short (sell) when it forms in an uptrend or at resistance levels because it signals that the
        uptrend may be ending.<br><br>

        <strong style="color: red;"> 9. The Railway Tracks Pattern</strong><br><br>

        There are bearish and bullish railway track candlestick patterns and it’s a twocandlestick pattern. One distinguishing
        quality of this pattern is that they resemble parallel railroad tracks and the candlesticks should practically be mirror
        images of one another in terms of length and body.
        <p><img src="https://mindtradingapps.pages.dev/price-action-strategy/new_version/price-action-profit-kit/images/85.webp"/></p>
        ● For a bearish railway track, the initial candle is bullish and is followed by a second candlestick with almost
        precisely the same length and body. This indicates that bears have gained dominance and bulls are losing ground.
        Therefore, you should look to sell when you see the bearish railway track pattern in an uptrend or in a zone of
        resistance because it may be a hint that the downtrend is about to begin.<br><br>

        ● The bullish railway track layout is analogous but in the other direction. Take note if you observe this in a
        downtrend or a support area it may be a sign that the market is about to move upward and your signal to purchase.
        <br><br>

        <strong style="color: red;">  10. The Spinning Top Pattern</strong><br><br>
        Spinning tops can be either reversal or continuation candlestick formations. Small bodies and longer upper and
        lower shadows are characteristics of spinning tops. Spinning tops represent uncertainty. A single candlestick pattern
        called a spinning top can be either bullish or bearish.

        <p><img src="https://mindtradingapps.pages.dev/price-action-strategy/new_version/price-action-profit-kit/images/86.webp"/></p>

     <span style="color: red;">  Come with me let me explain</span> <br><br>
        When you observe a bearish spinning top in a support region or in a downtrend, this can be
        interpreted as bullish reversal signal if the high of the bearish spinning top pattern is broken by
        the upside<br>
        Similar to this, when the low is broken to the downside, a bullish spinning top pattern in an uptrend or at a resistance
        level might be interpreted as a bearish signal.<br><br>
       <strong> The image below shows what am talking about :</strong>
       <p><img src="https://mindtradingapps.pages.dev/price-action-strategy/new_version/price-action-profit-kit/images/87.webp"/></p>
       When compared to other candlesticks, spinning
        tops are noticeably shorter in length, and their body length is a few steps wider than that of doji candlesticks.
        The wicks on both sides of a spinning top should be almost the same length, which is another important feature.
        The formation of spinning tops on support or resistance levels simply indicates to me that the market's bulls and
        bears are unsure of where to push the price, and the move in that direction is usually indicated when the next candle
        that forms breaks through the spinning top's low or high!<br><br>
