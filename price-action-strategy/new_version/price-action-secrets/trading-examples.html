    <h2>TRADING EXAMPLES</h2>
    <p>When I was in the army, I met an interesting guy named James during my demolition course. During the course, we had to pass both a theory and a practical exam before we could qualify as demolition men. At that time, my impression was that if you did well on your theory test, then your practical test should be a breeze. So when James did badly on his theory test, I thought his practical test would be a disaster. Boy, was I wrong. James came out on top for his practical test even though his theory was crap. That’s when I realized different people have different modes of learning. And for most people, the best way to learn is through practical examples so they can see how everything comes together. So here's how it works...</p>

    <p>I’ll break down the thought process behind each trade, discuss my entries, stop losses, and exits. I won’t reveal the outcome of each trade because it’s not important (and it’s random). Now, I don’t expect you to trade like me, so take what’s useful to you, ditch what’s irrelevant, and use this to develop your own trading plan. Ready? Then let’s kick things off with breakout trades…</p>
    
    <h2>NZDJPY DAILY – BREAKOUT</h2>
    <img src="https://mindtradingapps.pages.dev/price-action-strategy/new_version/price-action-secrets/images/67.webp" />
    <p>NZDJPY is in a potential accumulation stage, and it’s approaching resistance at 70.00. You can see a series of higher lows approaching resistance—and a buildup formed right now. This is a sign of strength because it tells me the buyers are willing to buy at higher prices—even at resistance. Also, if you overlay the 20 MA, you’ll notice it has caught up with the lows of a buildup, which signals that the market is getting ready to break out.</p>
    
    <p>So my plan is to have a buy stop order placed above the highs of resistance and have a stop loss of 1 ATR below the lows of the buildup. Now, if the breakout is real, this could transit into stage two, the advancing stage, and I want to ride the trend as long as it lasts. Thus, I’ll adopt a trailing stop loss of 3 ATR if the trade moves in my favor.</p>
    
    <p>I hope you’ve realized this is actually the MBEE formula you learned earlier. The only difference is that we’re doing this example as close to “real-time” as possible. So use this formula and ask yourself how else you could tweak this for your own needs.</p>
    
    <h2>EURNZD DAILY – BREAKOUT</h2>
    <img src="https://mindtradingapps.pages.dev/price-action-strategy/new_version/price-action-secrets/images/68.webp" />
    <p>EURNZD is in a range market. This isn’t an accumulation or distribution stage because if you zoom out, the market is still in a range. Nevertheless, there’s still a trading opportunity because the market broke below support and is now forming a buildup at previous support, which has now become resistance. Again, if you overlay the 20MA, you’ll notice it has caught up with the highs of the buildup, signaling that the market could make a move soon.</p>
    
    <p>My plan is to place a sell stop order below the lows of the buildup and have a stop loss of 1 ATR above the highs of the buildup. If you’re looking to ride a trend, you can use a trailing stop. Alternatively, if you want to capture a swing, 1.6600 is an area where you'll want to consider taking profits because it’s a major swing low, and buying pressure could step in.</p>
    
    <p>Now, a common question I get is “Rayner, why do you set your stop loss 1 ATR above the highs of a buildup. Why not 0.5 ATR or 2 ATR?” Yes, you could do that. But remember, the idea is to give your stop loss “room to breathe” so you don’t get stopped out by a sudden spike that takes out the highs. So the amount of “breathing room” you’ll want to give it is determined by the multiple of your ATR. The higher your multiple, the larger your stop loss (and vice versa).</p>
    
    <p>Don’t bother trying to figure out the best parameter, the best moving average, the best trailing stop loss, the best settings, or any other best choice because there’s no best out there. Instead, work on understanding the concept behind what you’re trying to achieve, and then use the appropriate tools to move towards that. This is the way you should approach trading.</p>
    
    <h2>BITCOIN DAILY – BREAKOUT</h2>
    <img src="https://mindtradingapps.pages.dev/price-action-strategy/new_version/price-action-secrets/images/69.webp" />
       
    <p>Bitcoin is in an accumulation stage, and it’s near resistance at $4200. You can see a series of higher lows as it moves into resistance (also known as an ascending triangle), which is a sign of strength because buyers are willing to buy at high prices. And if you overlay this chart with the 20 MA, you’ll see it has come into contact with the price and is “supporting” it higher into resistance.</p>
    <p>The plan is simple. I’m looking to place a buy stop order above the highs of resistance and have my stop loss set 1 ATR below the previous minor swing low. If the price moves in my favor, I’ll use 3 ATR to trail my stop loss. In this type of market condition, I always ride the trend with a trailing stop loss because the transition from accumulation to the advancing stage is where new trends are born.</p>
    
    <h2>EURCAD Daily - Reversal</h2>
    <img src="https://mindtradingapps.pages.dev/price-action-strategy/new_version/price-action-secrets/images/70.webp" />
    <p>EURCAD is in a declining stage with a series of lower highs and lows. Right now, the price made a swing into resistance, followed by a bearish engulfing pattern. This is a rejection of higher prices and buyers who bought at the breakout of resistance are now in the red.</p>
    <p>Since this market is in a downtrend and at resistance (area of value), I intend to short this market on the next candle’s open. My stop loss is 1 ATR above the bearish engulfing pattern. As for target profit, you can choose the nearest swing low at 1.4550 or the one that is further away at 1.4450 (I suggest having your target profit a few pips above the swing low because the price might not re-test the exact level).</p>
    <p>In terms of trade management, you can exit half of your position at target one and the remaining half at target two. Of course, you can adjust how much you want to exit at target one or two. Generally, however, you’ll want to keep at least 50% of your position for target two, or else the gains will not be meaningful. One last thing, I’d classify this as a weak trend. And in this type of market condition, I’d prefer to capture one swing, the reason being that in a weak trend, the pullback is steep and having a trailing stop loss would erode most of my open profits. Thus, I’d go with capturing a swing instead.</p>
   
    <h2> WTI DAILY – REVERSAL</h2>
    <img src="https://mindtradingapps.pages.dev/price-action-strategy/new_version/price-action-secrets/images/71.webp" />

    <h2>WTI (Western Texas Oil) - Range Market</h2>
    <p>WTI is in a range market, and the price made a power move into support. Next, the price traded below support at 51.15, only to make a sudden reversal—closing near the high of the day. At this point, traders who short the breakdown (of support) are in the red.</p>
    <p>To profit from this group of trapped traders, my plan is to go long on the next candle’s open with a stop loss 1 ATR below the low. As for target profit, I’m looking at 58.00 and 63.00 because that’s where selling pressure could step in.</p>
    <p>Now, let’s talk a little bit about trade management. It’s easy to have your entries, stop loss, and target profit defined. But what if the price moves in your favor, let’s say to 57.5—just shy of your first target— and it starts to reverse lower. What would you do? Do you hold onto your trade until it hits your stop loss? Or do you shift your stop loss to break even? Or do you exit part of your position? Clearly, there are no right or wrong answers, but you must take this into consideration (something most traders neglect).</p>
    
    <h2>GBPUSD Daily - Breakout</h2>
    <img src="https://mindtradingapps.pages.dev/price-action-strategy/new_version/price-action-secrets/images/72.webp" />
    <p>GBPUSD is in a declining stage, also known as a downtrend. Next, the price made a clean move into the swing low, only to be rejected strongly as the price closed higher (and formed a bullish hammer). Clearly, the traders who shorted the breakdown are in the red now.</p>
    <p>My plan is to go long on the next candle’s open with a stop loss of 1 ATR below the low of the candle. As for target profit, I’ll set it before the recent swing high around the 1.2290 area, where selling pressure could step in.</p>
    <p>Now, unlike the earlier examples where the MAEE formula is trading with the trend or in a range market, this is counter-trend trading, and I know that if I’m wrong, the market could reverse quickly against me. So for trade management, I’ll trail my stop loss below the previous candle low. This means if the price breaks and closes below the previous day’s low, I’ll manually exit the trade even if it hasn’t hit my target stop loss. This example highlights the flexibility of the MAEE formula. You can trade with the trend, in a range, or even against the trend.</p>
    <p>Up next, I’ll talk about when I stay out of the markets and why. Let’s go.</p>
    
    <h2>USDINR DAILY – STAY OUT</h2>
    <img src="https://mindtradingapps.pages.dev/price-action-strategy/new_version/price-action-secrets/images/73.webp" />   

    <p>USDINR is in a range market. As you can see, the price re-tested support and reversed strongly back into the middle of the range. At this point, I have no interest in buying or selling. Why?</p>
    <p>If you look at where the price is right now, it’s in the middle of nowhere. If I were to go long at this level, my stop loss has to go 1 ATR below support (where my trade gets invalidated), and my target is around $72 just before resistance. So if you were to calculate the risk-to-reward ratio, I’m risking $1.3 (entry at $71.4, stop loss at $70.1) to make $0.6 (target at $72)—not a trade I’m interested in making.</p>
    <p>You might be thinking, “So Rayner, what’s the minimum risk-to-reward ratio to aim for?” Recall that your risk to reward is only one part of the equation. The other is your winning rate. So if you have a high winning rate, you can get away with a risk-to-reward ratio of less than 1 to 1 (and vice versa). Personally, I want a minimum of 1 to 0.8 before the price hits the first “obstacle.”</p>

    <h2>S&P 500 Daily - Stay Out</h2>
    <img src="https://mindtradingapps.pages.dev/price-action-strategy/new_version/price-action-secrets/images/74.webp" />

    <p>The S&P 500 is in a strong uptrend. One way to tell is to overlay it with the 20 MA because in a strong uptrend, the price will tend to stay above it for a sustained period. So why stay out of this market even though it’s in an uptrend? There are two reasons:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The price is in no man’s land. It’s not near an area of value nor is there a buildup forming (so the MAEE and MBEE formula requirements have not been met).</li>
      <li>Even if you were to buy, there’s no logical place to set your stop loss since the nearest structure of the market is at $3150 (where previous resistance could become support).</li>
    </ol>
    <p>So given these two factors, I’d rather stay out of the market. My thought process here is based on the daily time frame. However, if you look at a lower time frame (for instance, the 15-minute time frame), there will be opportunities for you to trade because the market structure is different. So the takeaway is this: Even if there are no trading opportunities in your time frame, it doesn’t mean there are no opportunities for other participants because their time frames might be different.</p>

    <h2>US Treasury Bond Daily - Stay Out</h2>
    <img src="https://mindtradingapps.pages.dev/price-action-strategy/new_version/price-action-secrets/images/75.webp" />

    <p>US T-Bond futures is in an uptrend, and if you were to classify this further, it’s a healthy trend (because the price has “bounced off” multiple times). You might be thinking, “Why stay out of this market?” I’ll explain.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>As you can see, the price is “overextended” beyond the 50MA. If you were to buy right now, your stop loss would likely be triggered on the pullback if it isn’t wide enough.</li>
      <li>To set a proper stop loss, it has to go below the 50MA. This wide stop loss requires a smaller position size (if you want to keep your risk constant), which offers you a poor risk-to-reward ratio.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The solution? Let the market come to you because it’s better to trade near an area of value than to chase the breakout (and get stopped out on the pullback).</p>

    <h2>GOLD Daily - Stay Out</h2>
    <img src="https://mindtradingapps.pages.dev/price-action-strategy/new_version/price-action-secrets/images/76.webp" />

    <p>Gold is in an advancing stage after the price broke and closed above resistance. As you already know, just because the price is in an uptrend doesn’t mean you should immediately buy. Why? Because there’s no nearby price structure you can lean against to set your stop loss. So what now? You let the price come to you. Here are two possibilities for how this can play out:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The price re-tests the $1350 area (where previous resistance could become support) and forms a bullish price rejection. Then you can enter on the next candle’s open and have your stop loss 1 ATR below support.</li>
      <li>Alternatively, the price might not re-test previous resistance turned support. Instead, it might consolidate and form a buildup. Now, you don’t want to jump the gun here and enter the breakout too early, so what you want to do is let the 20MA “catch up” with the lows of the buildup. When that happens, you can place a buy stop order above the highs of the buildup and go long on the breakout, and your stop loss can go 1 ATR below the lows of the buildup.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>So yes, you’re staying out of gold for now, but this doesn’t mean you can go chill and watch Netflix. Instead, you must plan how the different scenarios could play out and how you could take advantage of these trading opportunities.</p>

    <h2>AT THIS POINT…</h2>
    <p>I’ve shared the thought process behind my trades with you. This includes my entries, exits, trade management—and most importantly, the why behind my decisions. Although we’re approaching the end of this book, that doesn’t mean it’s the end of your price action trading journey, because you’re always a student of the markets. Don’t forget that. And as you grow as a trader, you’ll discover new trading strategies, techniques, and nuances that you can adopt for your own trading. Now, I’ve got one last thing for you…</p>
