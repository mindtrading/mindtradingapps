    <h2>Final Words</h2>

    <p>Look at the picture below. This was me when I was 16 years old. This was near my peak weight of 108kg.</p>

    <p>Fast forward three years: I had lost all the extra weight and even gained some muscle.</p>

<p>
    But that’s not all. Because if you look at the picture
    below, you’ll see that not only was I fat, I was also the
    worst student in the class.</p>

    <p>Fast forward 10 years: I graduated with First Class
        Honours and even finished second in my cohort.</p>

            So why am I sharing this with you? To brag? To impress you? To let the world know how great I am?
            Nope, none of it. The first lesson I want to share with you is this…
        </p>
        <p>
            Your past (or present) does not equal to your future. It doesn’t matter if you’re someone who always screws
            things up, or you hate your job, or you’ve been fat all your life, or you’ve been a consistent loser in trading,
            or you’ve been a horrible husband/son/daughter/friend, or whatever you think is wrong. It doesn’t matter because
            your past does not equal your future. You have the power to change—it’s in you.
        </p>
        <p>
            You’re probably thinking: “So Rayner, how did you
            do it?” Well, the secret is this: It’s not the how, but
            the why. After I lost 30kg in about 10 months, people
            started asking me: “Hey Rayner, how did you lose
            all that weight and even maintain it?” Guess what?
            That’s the wrong question. The right question should
            be, why did you lose all those weight? Aha! Now we’re
            talking!
        </p>
        <p>
            I was a very self-conscious person when I was fat. I
            recall taking the bus and wondering if I was taking up so much space such that it was affecting the person
            next to me. When I raised my hands, I wondered
            if people were noticing the sweat stains under my
            armpits. When I came across a T-shirt I really liked,
            I wondered if there’s the right size for that would fit
            me (and more often than not, there isn’t).But wait, that’s not all. Because when you’re fat, you
            get attention no matter how much you try to avoid
            it. For example, when you’re with a group of friends
            having a meal at a restaurant and the bill is sky high,
            who do you make fun of? The fat guy because he
            eats the most. Or how about when you do a group
            project with your peers and you get a poor grade?
            Who do you blame? The fat guy because he’s lazy.
            And if you step into a shop, and a glass object
            breaks, who do you look at? The fat guy because he’s
            clumsy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now when you put all these things together, it’s
            tiring being fat. I decided enough was enough. So,
            for the first time ever, I stepped foot into a gym
            because the pain of being fat was greater than the
            pain of losing weight—and the rest is history.
        </p>
        <p>
            As you can see, the how isn’t as important as the
            why. Because when you find your why, the how will
            take care of itself. Now what about my studies? How
            did I go from being an F student to graduating with
            First Class Honours? By now you should know, it’s
            not the how, it’s the why. And here’s the why…
        </p>
        <p>
            My father was a solopreneur who sold cleaning
            products (like detergents, liquid soaps, and so on) to
            supermarkets. These goods are sold by the carton,
            and they’re heavy, weighing in at anywhere from 10
            to 20kg. So each day, he had to load these cartons
            (about 60 of them) into his truck and deliver them to
            various supermarkets around Singapore.
        </p>

        <p>
            When he was done, he would go back to his
            warehouse and load up the goods for the next day.
            Now, if you do the math, 60 x 10kg is around 600kg.
            And he would carry them twice, first during the loading phase and then again during the delivery
            phase. That’s a total of 1200kg per day! At the time
            my father was not a young man; he was in his 50s.
            Obviously, my father could have taken the easy way
            out, but no. He took the path less travelled for me.
            He did this just so I could study at a university. Just
            so I could have a competitive advantage when I
            joined the workforce. Just so I could have a better
            quality of life. When I realized this, I knew I couldn’t
            let him down. I had to make him proud no matter
            what it took, otherwise I couldn’t justify his sacrifice.
        </p>
        <p>
            So what did I do?
            I had to learn how to study. So I attended lectures,
            used Google for answers, YouTube for explanations,
            and so on. Was it easy? Of course not. I remembered
            the greatest hurdle came during my final year of
            exams. I was studying 12 hours a day in my room,
            looking at papers from doing past year papers,
            learning to understand important concepts, and
            doing math calculations. After a few weeks, I got
            really burned out and excuses started popping up in
            my head. “Why study so hard when you might not
            get First Class Honours? Why not settle for second
            upper? It’s good enough. Besides, a First Class
            Honours doesn’t guarantee that you’ll get a job you
            really want.” So how did I overcome these thoughts?
            I remembered my why. I was doing it for my father,
            who was out in the sun working his butt off, having
            to skip lunch just to meet deadlines and sometimes
            not even having enough time to pee. I must make
            him proud of all the sacrifices he’s making. I must
            justify his efforts. I must get my First Class Honours
            because the pain of not getting my First Class
            Honours is greater than the pain of studying.
        </p>
        <p>
            And trust me, your why will be tested along the way.
            You’ll encounter excuses, obstacles, and people who
            try to pull you down. But if you find your why, you
            will find a way because your why trumps all excuses.
        </p>
        <p>
            So before I go, here are two important lessons to
            remember:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Your past does not equal to your future</strong><br>
            You may feel like a loser right now, you may feel like
            people are looking down on you and like there’s no
            light at the end of the tunnel. But it doesn’t matter
            because you can grow and learn new things—and
            change your future. You have what it takes. You
            have the power to change. You are powerful beyond
            measure.</li>
            <li><strong>Your why is more important than the how</strong><br>
            Don’t focus on the how-tos, tactics, or strategies,
            because when times are tough, you’ll abandon
            everything you’ve learned. But if you find your why,
            you will persevere when times are tough, when
            the world seems against you, and when your back
            is against the wall. So find your why and the how
            will take care of itself because your why trumps all
            excuses.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            So, that said, I wish you all the very best. Good luck
            and good trading!
        </p>
