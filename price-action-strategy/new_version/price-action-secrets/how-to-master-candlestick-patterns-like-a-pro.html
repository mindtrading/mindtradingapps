    <h1>How to Master Candlestick Patterns Like a Pro</h1>

    <p>Back in my army days was when I was first learning about the financial markets, I had a lot of free time, and I didn’t want to waste it playing “Monster Hunter,” so I studied books that seemed interesting to me. At that time, I was reading stuff on value investing, financial markets, fundamental analysis, etc. However, things took a turn when one day, my army buddy was reading a book called Japanese Candlestick Charting Techniques by Steve Nison. Wow, what a game changer! It went against everything I’ve learned about speculation and the markets. And because it’s more “appealing” than reading numbers and ratios, I was hooked! I started memorizing every single candlestick pattern in the book. You know, stuff like the hammer, the shooting star, three black crows, harami, the bullish engulfing pattern, and so on. Eventually, I got burned out trying to cram all these patterns into my head. And the worst thing was, I still couldn’t make profits from any of them. So in this chapter, you’ll learn all about candlestick patterns, what they are, how they work, some information on reversal candlestick patterns, and why you don’t need to memorize a single pattern (if you follow what I’m about to teach you). Let’s begin.</p>
    
    <h2>WHAT IS A CANDLESTICK PATTERN AND HOW DOES IT WORK?</h2>
    
    <p>It’s said that Japanese candlestick patterns originated from a Japanese rice trader called Munehisa Homma during the 1700s. Almost 300 years later, this concept was introduced to the Western world by Steve Nison, in his book, Japanese Candlestick Charting Techniques. Now, it’s likely the original ideas have been modified somewhat, leading to the candlestick patterns you see today. Anyway, that’s the brief history behind Japanese candlestick patterns. So now the question is, how do you read a Japanese candlestick chart? Let’s begin by understanding that every candlestick pattern has four data points:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Open: the opening price.</li>
      <li>High: the highest price over a specific time period.</li>
      <li>Low: the lowest price over a specific time period.</li>
      <li>Close: the closing price.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Here’s an example:</p>
    
    <img src="images/16.webp" alt="Candlestick Chart Example"/>
    
    <p>Note: For a bullish candle, the open is always below the close. And for a bearish candle, the open is always above the close.</p>
    <h2>BULLISH REVERSAL CANDLESTICK PATTERNS</h2>

    <p>Bullish reversal candlestick patterns signify that buyers are momentarily in control. However, this doesn’t mean that you should buy immediately when you spot such a pattern because you must take the market conditions into consideration (more on that later). For now, these are five bullish reversal candlestick patterns we’ll be discussing:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Hammer.</li>
      <li>Bullish engulfing pattern.</li>
      <li>Piercing pattern.</li>
      <li>Tweezer bottom.</li>
      <li>Morning star.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Now, there are many more bullish reversal candlestick patterns out there. But you don’t need to know them all since the key focus here is just to get the gist of how to read candlestick patterns (and not to memorize any of the specific patterns). So let’s get started.</p>
    
    <h3>Hammer</h3>
    
    <p>A hammer is a (one-candle) bullish reversal pattern that forms after a decline in price. Here’s how to recognize it:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Little or no upper shadow.</li>
      <li>The price closes at the top ¼ of the range.</li>
      <li>The lower shadow is about two or three times the length of the body.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <img src="images/17.webp" alt="Hammer Candlestick Pattern"/>
    
    <p>And this is what a hammer means:</p>
    
    <ol>
      <li>When the market opened, the sellers took control and pushed the price lower.</li>
      <li>At the selling climax, huge buying pressure stepped in which pushed the price higher.</li>
      <li>The buying pressure was so strong that it closed above the opening price.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>In short, a hammer is a bullish reversal candlestick pattern that shows rejection of lower prices.</p>
    
    <h3>Bullish Engulfing Pattern</h3>
    
    <p>A bullish engulfing pattern is a (two-candle) bullish reversal pattern that forms after a decline in price. Here’s how to recognize it:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>The first candle has a bearish close.</li>
      <li>The body of the second candle completely “covers” the body of the first candle (without taking into consideration the shadow).</li>
      <li>The second candle closes bullish.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <img src="images/18.webp" alt="Bullish Engulfing Pattern"/>
    
    <p>And this is what a bullish engulfing pattern means:</p>
    
    <ol>
      <li>On the first candle, the sellers are in control because they closed lower for the period.</li>
      <li>On the second candle, strong buying pressure stepped in and the close was above the previous candle’s high, which tells you that buyers have won the battle for now.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>In essence, a bullish engulfing pattern tells you that the buyers have overwhelmed the sellers and they’re now in control.</p>
    
    <h3>Piercing Pattern</h3>
    
    <p>A piercing pattern is a (two-candle) reversal pattern that forms after a decline in price. Unlike the bullish engulfing pattern which closes above the previous open, the piercing pattern closes within the body of the previous candle. Thus, in terms of strength, the piercing pattern isn’t as strong as the bullish engulfing pattern. Here’s how to recognize it:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>The first candle has a bearish close.</li>
      <li>The body of the second candle closes beyond the halfway mark of the first candle.</li>
      <li>The second candle closes bullish.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <img src="images/19.webp" alt="Piercing Pattern"/>
    
    <p>And this is what a piercing pattern means:</p>
    
    <ol>
      <li>On the first candle, the sellers are in control because they closed lower for the period.</li>
      <li>On the second candle, buying pressure has stepped in and the close was bullish (more than 50% of the previous body), which tells you there is buying pressure present. Next....</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tweezer Bottom</h2>

<p>When I say tweezer, I don’t mean the tool you use to pick your nose hairs (although it sure looks like one). Instead, a tweezer bottom is a (two-candle) reversal pattern that occurs after a decline in price. Here’s how to recognize it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The first candle shows rejection of lower prices.</li>
  <li>The second candle re-tests the low of the previous candle and closes higher.</li>
</ul>

<img src="images/20.webp" alt="Tweezer Bottom Candlestick Pattern"/>

<p>This is what a tweezer bottom means:</p>

<ol>
  <li>On the first candle, the sellers pushed the price lower and were met with some buying pressure.</li>
  <li>On the second candle, the sellers again tried to push the price lower but failed and were finally overwhelmed by strong buying pressure.</li>
</ol>

<p>In short, a tweezer bottom tells you the market has difficulty trading lower (after two attempts) and the price is likely to head higher.</p>

<h2>Morning Star</h2>

<p>A morning star is a (three-candle) bullish reversal pattern that forms after a decline in price. Here’s how to recognize it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The first candle has a bearish close.</li>
  <li>The second candle has a small range.</li>
  <li>The third candle closes aggressively higher (at more than 50% of the first candle).</li>
</ul>

<img src="images/21.webp" alt="Morning Star Candlestick Pattern"/>

<p>And this is what a morning star means:</p>

<ol>
  <li>On the first candle, the sellers are in control since the price closes lower.</li>
  <li>On the second candle, there is indecision in the markets because both selling and buying pressure are in equilibrium (that’s why the range of the candle is small).</li>
  <li>On the third candle, the buyers have won the battle and the price closes higher.</li>
</ol>

<p>In short, a morning star tells you that the sellers are exhausted and the buyers are momentarily in control.</p>

<h2>BEARISH REVERSAL CANDLESTICK PATTERNS</h2>

<p>Bearish reversal candlestick patterns signify that sellers are momentarily in control. However, this doesn’t mean you should sell immediately when you spot such a pattern because you must take the market conditions into consideration (more on that later). For now, these are the five bearish reversal candlestick patterns that we’ll be discussing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Shooting star</li>
  <li>Bearish engulfing pattern</li>
  <li>Dark cloud cover</li>
  <li>Tweezer top</li>
  <li>Evening star</li>
</ul>

<h3>Shooting Star</h3>

<p>A shooting star is a (one-candle) bearish reversal pattern that forms after an advance in price. Here’s how to recognize it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>There is little or no lower shadow.</li>
  <li>The price closes at the bottom quarter of the range.</li>
  <li>The upper shadow is about two or three times the length of the body.</li>
</ul>

<img src="images/22.webp" alt="Shooting Star Candlestick Pattern"/>

<p>And this is what a shooting star means:</p>

<ol>
  <li>When the market opened, the buyers took control and pushed the price higher.</li>
  <li>At the buying climax, huge selling pressure stepped in and pushed the price lower.</li>
  <li>The selling pressure was so strong that it closed below the opening price.</li>
</ol>

<p>In short, a shooting star is a bearish reversal candlestick pattern that shows rejection of higher prices.</p>

<h3>Bearish Engulfing Pattern</h3>

<p>A bearish engulfing pattern is a (two-candle) bearish reversal pattern that forms after an advance in price. Here’s how to recognize it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The first candle has a bullish close.</li>
  <li>The body of the second candle completely “covers” the body first candle (without taking into consideration the shadow).</li>
  <li>The second candle closes bearish.</li>
</ul>

<img src="images/23.webp" alt="Bearish Engulfing Pattern"/>

<p>And this is what a bearish engulfing pattern means:</p>

<ol>
  <li>On the first candle, the buyers were in control since they closed higher for the period.</li>
  <li>On the second candle, strong selling pressure stepped in and the price closed below the previous candle’s low, which tells you that the sellers have won the battle for now.</li>
</ol>

<p>In essence, a bearish engulfing pattern tells you the sellers have overwhelmed the buyers and are now in control.</p>

<h3>Dark Cloud Cover</h3>

<p>A dark cloud cover is a (two-candle) reversal pattern that forms after an advance in price. Unlike the bearish engulfing pattern that closes below the previous open, the dark cloud cover closes within the body of the previous candle. Thus, in terms of strength, dark cloud cover isn’t as strong as the bearish engulfing pattern. Here’s how to recognize it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The first candle has a bullish close.</li>
  <li>The body of the second candle closes beyond the halfway mark of the first candle.</li>
  <li>The second candle closes bearish.</li>
</ul>

<img src="images/24.webp" alt="Dark Cloud Cover Candlestick Pattern"/>

<p>And this is what a dark cloud cover means:</p>

<ol>
  <li>On the first candle, the buyers are in control because they closed higher for the period.</li>
  <li>On the second candle, selling pressure stepped in and the price closed bearishly (more than 50% of the previous body), which tells you there is some selling pressure. Next…</li>
</ol>
<h2>Tweezer Top</h2>

<p>A tweezer top is a (two-candle) reversal pattern that occurs after an advance in price. Here’s how to recognize it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The first candle shows rejection of higher prices.</li>
  <li>The second candle re-tests the high of the previous candle and closes lower.</li>
</ul>

<img src="images/25.webp" alt="Tweezer Top Candlestick Pattern"/>

<p>This is what a tweezer top means:</p>

<ol>
  <li>On the first candle, the buyers pushed the price higher and were met with some selling pressure.</li>
  <li>On the second candle, the buyers again tried to push the price higher but failed and were finally overwhelmed by strong selling pressure.</li>
</ol>

<p>In short, a tweezer top tells you the market has difficulty trading higher (after two attempts) and it’s likely to head lower.</p>

<h2>Evening Star</h2>

<p>An evening star is a (three-candle) bearish reversal pattern that forms after an advance in price. Here’s how to recognize it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The first candle has a bullish close.</li>
  <li>The second candle has a small range.</li>
  <li>The third candle closes aggressively lower (more than 50% of the first candle).</li>
</ul>

<img src="images/26.webp" alt="Evening Star Candlestick Pattern"/>

<p>And this is what an evening star means:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The first candle shows the buyers are in control as the price closes higher.</li>
  <li>On the second candle, there is indecision in the markets because both the selling and buying pressure are in equilibrium (that’s why the range of the candle is small).</li>
  <li>On the third candle, the sellers won the battle and the price closed lower.</li>
</ol>

<p>In short, an evening star tells you the buyers are exhausted, and the sellers are momentarily in control.</p>

<h2>How to Understand Any Candlestick Patterns Without Memorizing a Single One</h2>

<p>All you need to do is ask yourself these two questions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Where did the price close relative to the range?</li>
</ol>

<p>Look at this candlestick pattern:</p>

<img src="images/27.webp" alt="Candlestick Pattern Example 1"/>

<p>Who’s in control? Well, the price closed near highs of the range, which tells you the buyers are in control. Next, look at this candlestick pattern:</p>

<img src="images/28.webp" alt="Candlestick Pattern Example 2"/>

<p>Who’s in control? Although it’s a bullish candle, the sellers are actually the ones in control. Why? Because the price closed near the lows of the range and shows rejection of higher prices. So remember, if you want to know who’s in control, ask yourself, “Where did the price close relative to the range?”</p>

<ol start="2">
  <li>What’s the size of the candlestick pattern relative to the earlier ones?</li>
</ol>

<p>This question will help you determine if there’s any strength (or conviction) behind the move. So what you want to do is compare the size of the current candle to the earlier ones. If the current candle is much larger (like two or more times larger), this tells you there’s strength behind the move.</p>
<img src="images/29.webp" alt="Candlestick Pattern Example 3"/>
<p>If there’s no strength behind the move, the size of the current candle is about the same as the earlier ones. This is what I mean:</p>

<img src="images/30.webp" alt="Candlestick Pattern Example 3"/>

<p>Does this make sense to you? Great! You can now read and understand any candlestick patterns like a pro. It doesn’t matter if it’s a doji, a spinning top, a harami, three white soldiers, or any other kind of pattern. You have what it takes.</p>

<h2>Purpose of Candlestick Patterns</h2>

<p>Well, candlestick patterns are useful as entry triggers to help you time your entry. Recall that market structure tells you what to do. Support and resistance (or the area of value) tells you where to trade. And candlestick patterns tell you when to enter. I hope you’re starting to see the picture I’m trying to paint. But before we dive into trading strategies, there’s one more critical component I must cover, so read on.</p>

<h2>SUMMARY</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Candlestick patterns give you an idea of who’s currently in control of the markets.</li>
  <li>There are three types of candlestick patterns: reversal, indecision, and continuation.</li>
  <li>If you want to know who’s currently in control of the markets, ask yourself, “Where did the price close relative to the range?”</li>
  <li>If you want to know if there’s strength behind a move, ask yourself, “What’s the size of the candlestick pattern relative to the earlier ones?”</li>
  <li>Candlestick patterns are useful as entry triggers to time your entries.</li>
  <li>Don’t trade candlestick patterns in isolation. You must take into account the context of the markets (and aspects like market structure and area of value).</li>
</ul>
