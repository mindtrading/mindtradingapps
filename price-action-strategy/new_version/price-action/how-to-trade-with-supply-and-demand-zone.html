    <p>In this article, I will discuss&nbsp;<strong>Supply and Demand Zone Trading&nbsp;</strong>in detail. Please read our previous article discussing&nbsp;How to Trade with Smart Money. As part of this article, we are going to discuss the following pointers, which are related to Supply and Demand Zone Trading.</p>
    <ol>
    <li><strong>Structure of the Market.</strong></li>

    <h4><strong>STRUCTURE OF MARKET</strong></h4>
    <p>The price goes through the following phases</p>
    <ol>
    <li>ACCUMULATION</li>
    <li>REACCUMULATION</li>
    <li>UPTREND</li>
    <li>DISTRIBUTION</li>
    <li>REDISTRIBUTION</li>
    <li>DOWNTREND</li>

    <p><strong>ACCUMULATION&nbsp;</strong>Smart money removes the floating supply of stock by buying. This process is called accumulation.</p>
    <p><strong>TREND UP&nbsp;</strong>Smart money aggressively moves prices up</p>
    <p><strong>DISTRIBUTION&nbsp;</strong>SM will take advantage of the higher prices obtained in the rally to take profits by beginning to sell the stock back to the uninformed traders/investors</p>

    <h4><strong>LAWS OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND Trading</strong></h4>
    <p>All financial markets work on the universal law of Supply and Demand.</p>
    <p><strong>Law of Demand</strong>&ndash; The higher the price of an item, the less the demand (buyers don&rsquo;t want to buy at a higher price), and the lower the price, the higher the demand (buyers want to buy at a low price)</p>
    <div class="default-creative-container">&nbsp;</div>
    <p><strong>The Law of Supply-</strong>&nbsp;The higher the price, the higher the supply (sellers want to sell at a higher price), and the lower the price, the lower the supply(sellers don&rsquo;t want to supply at a lower price.</p>
    <h4><strong>What are Supply and Demand Zones</strong></h4>
    <p>Supply-demand is nothing but the border area of support or resistance</p>
    <div class="default-creative-container">&nbsp;</div>

    <p>In the chart above, you can see a demand zone (broad support level) and a supply zone (broad area of resistance).</p>
    <p>What we want to find at the price zones where supply overwhelms demand and supply overwhelms supply.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>The former is known as SUPPLY ZONES. When the market bumps into SUPPLY ZONES, the price will drop. Then, you can make money by shorting the market.</li>
    <li>The latter is the market DEMAND ZONE. With the support of demand, the price will rise. Then, you can profit in a long position.</li>
    <li>If the supply zone is broken, it becomes a demand zone. pullback test from the demand zone, you can go long.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4><strong>How to Find Supply and Demand Zones in Trading</strong></h4>
    <p>&nbsp;Two steps to identify the supply and demand zones.</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Look at the chart and try to spot large successive candles. It is important that the price moves a lot.</li>
    <li>Establish the base (usually sideways price action area) from which the price started the quick move.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4><strong>Different Types of Supply and Demand Formations</strong>&nbsp;</h4>
    <p>There are different supply and demand zone patterns. Some of the more popular ones are shown below:</p>
    <p>TREND CONTINUOUS BASE</p>
    <ol>
    <li>RALLY BASE RALLY(RBR)</li>
    <li>DOWN BASE DOWN (DBD)</li>
    </ol>
    <p>TREND REVERSAL BASE</p>
    <ol>
    <li>RALLY BASE DROP (RBD)</li>
    <li>DOWN BASE RALLY (DBR)</li>
    </ol>
    <p>And</p>
    <p>FLIP ZONE</p>

    <h4><strong>STRENGTH OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND ZONE</strong></h4>
    <h4><strong>How did the price leave the level? STRENGTH OF THE MOVE</strong></h4>
    <div class="default-creative-container">&nbsp;</div>
    <p>The Logic: The stronger the price moves away from a zone, the more out-of-balance supply and demand are at that zone. A heavy order is placed by smart money.</p>

    <h4><strong>How much time did the price spend at the zone? TIME AT LEVEL</strong></h4>
    <p><strong>The Logic:</strong>&nbsp;The less time the price spends at a zone, the more out-of-balance supply and demand are at the price level. Smart money aggressively entering</p>
    <div class="default-creative-container">&nbsp;</div>
    <p>At price levels with supply and demand zones more out of balance, the price will spend the least amount of time at the level</p>

    <h4>How far did the price move away from the zone before returning to the zone?</h4>
    <p><strong>The Logic:</strong>&nbsp;The farther the price moves away from a zone before returning to that zone, the greater the reward to risk and probability.</p>
    <div class="default-creative-container">&nbsp;</div>
    <p>When the price returns to that supply level for our short entry, we have a good idea of where the buyers are (the demand) and, just as importantly, where they are not.</p>

    <h4><strong>When does Supply/Demand break?</strong></h4>
    <p>After a zone is tested many times or during a strong move, Supply and Demand levels eventually break. Due to the remaining orders being triggered and gradually removed or an overwhelming amount of orders in the opposite direction breaking the level.</p>
    <h4><strong>Price action</strong></h4>
    <ul>
    <li>If the price stays near or at these zones &amp; doesn&rsquo;t fall much, then there is a high probability that they will break the zone</li>
    <li>A strong move to the zone may break the zone</li>
    <li>low volume test confirms the zone</li>
    </ul>
    <h4><strong>HOW TO ENTER DEMAND AND SUPPLY USING PRICE ACTION?</strong></h4>
    <ol>
    <li>Find the SD zone on HTF(HIGHER TIME FRAME), then wait for the price to come to this level</li>
    <li>See any acceptance or rejection from this zone on trading time frame(TTF)</li>
    <li>Any reversal price action signal on TTF</li>
    <li>Entry in the direction of the dominant trend</li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
    <li>Suppose context downtrend, price rally to the supply zone on TTF, then any bearish reversal PA signal for an entry short</li>
    <li>Also, notice the volume on these reversals. A low-volume test is a good sign &amp; they are highly probable trades.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>TIPS&nbsp;</strong>for day trading: The previous day&rsquo;s high and the previous day&rsquo;s low are the supply and demand zones. Look for price action around there for acceptance or rejection of these zones</p>
    <p><strong>Let&rsquo;s do an example</strong></p>
    <h4><strong>Find the supply and demand zone in a higher time frame</strong></h4>
    <p>In an hourly time frame, we find the zone</p>
    <div class="default-creative-container">&nbsp;</div>

    <p>1. whether the trend is up or down &ndash; determines which side we want to be on</p>
    <p>2. Where are the big-picture support and demand levels?</p>
    <p>We don&rsquo;t want to be long below the supply zone</p>
    <h4><strong>WHEN THE PRICE APPROACHES DEMAND ZONE</strong></h4>
    <p>WE WANT TO SEE SIGN OF STRENGTH PRICE ACTION FOR CONFIRMATION OF THE ZONE</p>
    <div class="default-creative-container">&nbsp;</div>

    <h4><strong>Supply and Demand Zone Trading Summary:</strong></h4>
    <p>Supply and Demand Zone trading is a popular technical analysis and trading strategy. It is based on the principles of supply and demand, which are fundamental factors that affect the price of assets in financial markets. This trading strategy seeks to identify key levels where supply and demand imbalances occur and then make trading decisions based on those levels.</p>
    <p>So, Supply and Demand Zone Trading is a method used in financial markets to identify areas on a price chart where the price has previously made a strong move away. These zones are essentially the price levels with a potential imbalance between buyers and sellers&mdash; a surplus of demand over supply (demand zones) or supply over demand (supply zones). This approach is rooted in the basic economic principles of supply and demand and is widely used in various markets, including forex, stocks, and commodities.</p>
    <p>Here&rsquo;s a breakdown of how Supply and Demand Zone trading works:</p>
    <h4><strong>Demand Zones:</strong></h4>
    <p>These are price levels where buyers have previously entered the market aggressively, causing the price to rise sharply. If the price returns to this area, buyers will likely be interested again, and the excess demand will push the price upward.</p>
    <div class="default-creative-container">&nbsp;</div>
    <p><strong>Characteristics of Demand Zones:</strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li>They are typically located above the current price.</li>
    <li>They are identified by a noticeable upward move away from a price level.</li>
    <li>The entry point for a long position is often when the price re-enters this zone.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4><strong>Supply Zones:</strong></h4>
    <p>Conversely, supply zones are areas where sellers have overwhelmed buyers, resulting in a sharp price decline. If the price returns to this level, the same imbalance could happen again, pushing prices lower.</p>
    <p><strong>Characteristics of Supply Zones:</strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li>They are usually found below the current price.</li>
    <li>They are identified by a significant move downward away from a price level.</li>
    <li>The entry point for a short position is when the price revisits this zone.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4><strong>Trading Using Supply and Demand Zones:</strong></h4>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Identification:</strong>&nbsp;Traders use historical price data to identify these zones. The zones are often marked by a series of candles on a chart that shows a strong move away from a particular price level.</li>
    <li><strong>Confirmation:</strong>&nbsp;Many traders wait for confirmation before trading these zones that the price reacts to these levels. Confirmation can come from price patterns, candlestick formations, or other technical indicators.</li>
    <li><strong>Entry Points:</strong>&nbsp;Traders may enter the market when the price returns to a supply or demand zone and shows signs of moving in the expected direction again.</li>
    <li><strong>Stop Loss and Take Profit:</strong>&nbsp;A common practice is to place a stop loss just outside the opposite side of the zone to minimize potential losses. The take-profit levels are often set based on key support and resistance levels or a certain risk-reward ratio.</li>
    <li><strong>Risk Management:</strong>&nbsp;Traders must manage their risk when trading supply and demand zones. This means not risking more than a small percentage of their trading capital on any single trade.</li>
    <li><strong>Timeframe:</strong>&nbsp;Supply and demand zones can be identified on various timeframes. However, zones identified on higher timeframes (like daily, weekly, or monthly charts) are often considered more significant.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4><strong>Advantages:</strong></h4>
    <ul>
    <li>Based on straightforward and fundamental market principles.</li>
    <li>Zones can be visual and relatively easy to identify.</li>
    <li>It can be used in conjunction with other forms of analysis for better results.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></h4>
    <ul>
    <li>Zones may not always be respected by the market, especially in the presence of significant news or events.</li>
    <li>Identifying true supply and demand zones requires practice and experience.</li>
    <li>Over-reliance on zones without confirmation can lead to poor trade.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Supply and demand zone trading is just one of many strategies traders use, and, like any strategy, it is not foolproof. It requires a good understanding of market behavior, patience to wait for the right setups, and strict discipline to follow a pre-determined trading plan.</p>
