<p class="article">

   Bullish Rectangle Chart Pattern is a continuation chart pattern that forms during an uptrend. 
   It shows that the buying and selling pressure is equal and that the direction of the trend 
   is not likely to change. The pattern is defined by a period of consolidation within a trend, 
   which is bounded by a parallel support and resistance level.<br><br>

   Traders generally look to enter a long position (buy) after the price breaks above the resistance 
   level of the rectangle. The rectangle's height can be added to the point of breakout to set a 
   target for the price move after the breakout.<br><br>

   It's always recommended to look for confirmations with other technical analysis tools 
   before making a trade decision based on this pattern.<br><br>
