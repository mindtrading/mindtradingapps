<p class="article">

   <strong>Implication</strong><br><br>

   A Triple Top is considered a bearish signal, indicating a possible reversal of the current 
   uptrend to a new downtrend.<br><br>
   
   <strong>Description</strong><br><br>
   
   A Triple Top is a reversal pattern. It marks an uptrend in the process of becoming a downtrend.<br></br>
   
   The Triple Top pattern is comprised of three sharp peaks, all at the same level. 
   While the three peaks should be sharp and distinct, the lows of the pattern can 
   appear as rounded valleys. The pattern is complete when prices decline below the 
   lowest low in the formation. The lowest low is also called the "confirmation point".<br></br>
   
   The three peaks are well separated and are not part of a congestion pattern. 
   The peaks do not have to be precisely at the same level.<br></br>

   There is a hybrid variation that appears to be a cross between a Double and Triple Top. 
   The middle peak is slightly lower than the left and right peaks. 
   This is still a valid reversal pattern.<br></br>

   It is also possible for the pattern to display a fourth peak before reversal occurs.<br></br>

   Generally, volume in a Triple Top tends to be downward as the pattern forms. 
   Volume is lighter on each rally peak. Volume then picks up as prices fall 
   under the confirmation point and break into the new downward trend. 
   Volume is higher on the peaks than at the lows. <br></br>

   <strong>Important Characteristics</strong><br></br>

   Following are important characteristics for a Triple Top.<br></br>

   <strong>Duration of the Pattern</strong><br></br>

   This pattern can take upwards of several months to form. 
   In addition, experts agree that the longer the pattern takes to form, 
   the greater the significance of the price move once breakout occurs. 
   The three highs do not need to be equally spaced from one another. <br></br>

   <strong>Need for an Uptrend</strong><br></br>

   The Triple Top is a reversal pattern marking the transition period between an 
   uptrend and a downtrend in prices. This pattern must begin with an uptrend of prices.<br></br>

   <strong>Volume</strong><br></br>

   It is typical to see volume diminish as the pattern progresses. 
   This should change, however, when breakout occurs. 
   A valid breakout should be accompanied by a burst in volume. 
   Some experts are less concerned by seeing a steadily diminishing 
   trend in volume as the pattern progresses through its three highs. 
   All agree, however, that an investor will want to see a definite 
   increase in volume at the time of the break through the confirmation point.<br></br>

   <strong> Rally after Breakout</strong><br></br>

   A high percentage of Triple Tops have rallies back to the point of the breakdown 
   more often than not.<br></br>

   <strong>Trading Considerations</strong><br></br>

  <strong>Duration</strong> <br></br>

   Consider the duration of the pattern and its relationship to your trading time horizons. 
   The duration of the pattern is considered to be an indicator of the duration of the 
   influence of this pattern. The longer the pattern the longer it will take for the price 
   to move to its target. The shorter the pattern the sooner the price move. If you are 
   considering a short-term trading opportunity, look for a pattern with a short duration. 
   If you are considering a longer-term trading opportunity, 
   look for a pattern with a longer duration.<br></br>

   <strong>Target Price</strong><br></br>

   The target price provides an important indication about the potential price 
   move that this pattern indicates. Consider whether the target price for this 
   pattern is sufficient to provide adequate returns after your costs (such as commissions) 
   have been taken into account. A good rule of thumb is that the target price must 
   indicate a potential return of greater than 5% before a pattern should be considered useful. 
   However you must consider the current price and the volume of shares you intend to trade. Also, 
   check that the target price has not already been achieved.<br></br>

   <strong>Inbound Trend</strong><br></br>

   The inbound trend is an important characteristic of the pattern. 
   A shallow inbound trend may indicate a period of consolidation 
   before the price move indicated by the pattern begins. Look for an 
   inbound trend that is longer than the duration of the pattern. 
   A good rule of thumb is that the inbound trend should be at least 
   two times the duration of the pattern.<br></br>

   <strong>Criteria that Support</strong><br></br>

   Support and Resistance<br></br>

   Look for a region of support or resistance around the target price. 
   A region of price consolidation or a strong Support and Resistance 
   Line at or around the target price is a strong indicator that the 
   price will move to that point<br></br>

   <strong>Location of Moving Average</strong><br></br>

   The Triple Top should be above the Moving Average. Compare the location of the pattern 
   to a Moving Average of appropriate length. For short duration patterns use a 50 day Moving Average, 
   for longer patterns use a 200 day Moving Average.<br></br>

   <strong>Moving Average Trend</strong><br></br>

   The Moving Average should change direction within the duration of 
   the pattern and should head in the direction indicated by the pattern. 
   For short duration patterns use a 50 day Moving Average, for longer 
   patterns use a 200 day Moving Average<br></br>

   <strong>Volume</strong><br></br>

   A strong volume spike on the day of the pattern confirmation is a 
   strong indicator in support of the potential for this pattern. 
   The volume spike should be significantly above the average of the 
   volume for the duration of the pattern. In addition, the volume 
   within the duration of the pattern should be declining on average.<br></br>

   <strong>Other Patterns</strong><br></br>

   Other reversal patterns (such as Bullish and Bearish Engulfing Lines and Islands) 
   that occur at the peaks and valleys indicate strong resistance at those points. 
   The presence of these patterns inside a Triple Top is a strong indication 
   in support of this pattern. <br></br>

   <strong>Criteria that Refute</strong><br></br>

   No Volume Spike on Confirmation<br></br>

   The lack of a volume spike on the day of the pattern confirmation is an 
   indication that this pattern may not be reliable. In addition, 
   f the volume has remained constant, or was increasing, over the 
   duration of the pattern, then this pattern should be considered less reliable.<br></br>

   <strong>Location of Moving Average</strong><br></br>

   The Triple Top should be above the Moving Average. Compare the location of 
   the pattern to a Moving Average of appropriate length. For short duration patterns 
   use a 50 day Moving Average, for longer patterns use a 200 day Moving Average. 
   If the Triple Top is below the Moving Average then this pattern should be 
   considered less reliable.<br></br>

   <strong>Moving Average Trend</strong><br></br>

   A Moving Average that is trending in the opposite direction to 
   that indicated by the pattern is an indication that this pattern is less reliable. 
   Look at the direction of the Moving Average Trend. For short duration patterns 
   use a 50 day Moving Average, for longer patterns use a 200 day Moving Average.<br></br>

   <strong>Short Inbound Trend</strong><br></br>

   An inbound trend that is significantly shorter than the pattern duration 
   is an indication that this pattern should be considered less reliable.<br></br>

   <strong>Underlying Behavior</strong><br></br>

   A Triple Top occurs when prices are in an uptrend. Prices rise to a resistance level, 
   retreat, return to the resistance level again, retreat, and finally, 
   return to that resistance level for a third time before declining. In a 
   classic Triple Top, the decline following the third peak marks the beginning of a downtrend.
