<p class="article">
   <strong>Description</strong><br><br>
   
   A Descending Continuation Triangle features two converging trendlines. 
   The bottom trendline is horizontal and the top trendline slopes downward. 
   The pattern illustrates lows occurring at a constant price level, with highs 
   moving constantly lower. The pattern displays two highs touching the upper 
   trendline and two lows touching the lower trendline.<br></br>
   
   This pattern is confirmed when the price breaks out of the triangle 
   formation to close below the lower trendline.<br></br>

   Volume is an important factor to consider. Typically, volume follows a 
   reliable pattern: volume should diminish as the price swings back and forth 
   between an increasingly narrow range of highs and lows. However, when breakout occurs, 
   there should be a noticeable increase in volume. If this volume picture is not clear, 
   investors should be cautious about decisions made based on this pattern.<br></br>


   <strong>Important Characteristics</strong><br></br>

   Following are important characteristics about this pattern.<br></br>

   <strong>Occurrence of a Breakout</strong><br></br>

   Technical analysts pay close attention to how long the Triangle 
   takes to develop to its apex. The general rule is that prices should break out - 
   clearly penetrate the lower trendline - somewhere between threequarters and 
   two-thirds of the horizontal width of the formation. The break out, in other words, 
   should occur well before the pattern reaches the apex of the Triangle. 
   The closer the breakout occurs to the apex the less reliable the formation.<br></br>

   <strong>Duration of the Triangle</strong><br></br>

   The Triangle is a relatively short-term pattern. It may take from one to three months to form.<br></br>

   <strong>Shape of Descending Triangle</strong><br></br>

   The horizontal bottom trendline need not be completely horizontal.<br></br>

   <strong>Volume</strong><br></br>

   Investors should see volume decreasing as the pattern progresses toward the apex of the Triangle. 
   At breakout, however, there should be a noticeable increase in volume<br></br>

   <strong>Trading Considerations</strong><br><br>

   <strong>Duration of Pattern</strong><br><br>
   
   Consider the duration of the pattern and its relationship to your trading time horizons. 
   The duration of the pattern is considered to be an indicator of the duration of the influence 
   of this pattern. The longer the pattern the longer it will take for the price to reach its target. 
   The shorter the pattern the sooner the price moves. If you are considering a 
   short-term trading opportunity, look for a pattern with a short duration. 
   If you are considering a longer-term trading opportunity, look for a pattern 
   with a longer duration.<br></br>
   
   

   <strong>Target Price</strong><br></br>

   The target price provides an important indication about the potential price move that this 
   pattern indicates. Consider whether the target price for this pattern is sufficient to 
   provide adequate returns after your costs (such as commissions) have been taken into account. 
   A good rule of thumb is that the target price must indicate a potential return of greater 
   than 5% before a pattern should be considered useful. However you must consider the current 
   price and the volume of shares you intend to trade. Also, check that the target price 
   has not already been achieved.<br></br>

   <strong>Inbound Trend</strong><br></br>

   The inbound trend is an important characteristic of the pattern. 
   A shallow inbound trend may indicate a period of consolidation before 
   the price move indicated by the pattern begins. Look for an inbound trend 
   that is longer than the duration of the pattern. A good rule of thumb is 
   that the inbound trend should be at least 2 times the duration of the pattern.<br></br>

   <strong>Criteria that Support</strong><br></br>

   Look for a region of support at the bottom trendline and a line of resistance 
   at the highest high of the Triangle..<br></br>

   <strong>Moving Average</strong><br></br>

   Compare prices to the 200 day Moving Average. When prices are close to or touch the 200 day Moving Average this signal is considered stronger.<br></br>

   <strong>Volume</strong><br></br>

   A strong volume spike on the day of the pattern confirmation is a strong indicator in 
   support of the potential for this pattern. The volume spike should be significantly 
   above the average of the volume for the duration of the pattern. In addition, the 
   volume during the duration of the pattern should be declining on average.<br></br>

   <strong>Criteria that Refute</strong><br></br>

   No Volume Spike on Breakout<br></br>

   The lack of a volume spike on the day of the pattern confirmation is an 
   indication that this pattern may not be reliable. In addition, if the volume has 
   remained constant, or was increasing, over the duration of the pattern, 
   then this pattern should be considered less reliable.<br></br>

   <strong>Short Inbound Trend</strong><br></br>

   An inbound trend that is significantly shorter than the pattern duration 
   is an indication that this pattern should be considered less reliable.<br></br>

   <strong>Underlying Behavior</strong><br></br>

   This pattern with its increasingly lower highs and constant lows indicates that sellers are more aggressive than buyers.
