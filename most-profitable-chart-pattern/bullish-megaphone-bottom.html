    <p><strong>Implication</strong></p>
    <p>A Megaphone Bottom also known as a Broadening Bottom is considered a bullish signal, indicating that the current downtrend may reverse to form a new uptrend.</p>
    <p><strong>Description</strong></p>
    <p>This rare formation can be recognized by the successively higher highs and lower lows, which form after a downward move. Usually, two higher highs between three lower lows form the pattern, which is completed when prices break above the second higher high and do not fall below it.</p>
    <p>The pattern is completed when, usually on the third upswing within the pattern, prices break above the prior high but fail to fall below this level again.</p>
