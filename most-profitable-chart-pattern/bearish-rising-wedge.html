A bearish rising wedge is a technical chart pattern that signals a potential downward 
trend reversal following an upward trend. It's essentially a triangle-like formation 
where the price oscillates within a channel formed by two converging trendlines, one 
drawn connecting the higher highs and the other connecting the lower lows. As the pattern progresses, 
the highs and lows become closer together, visually resembling a tightening wedge. 
This indicates a loss of upward momentum and a growing pressure to break down.<br><br>

Here's a breakdown of the key characteristics of a bearish rising wedge:<br><br>

<ol type="a">
<li><strong>Converging trendlines:</strong> The two trendlines, one drawn along the higher highs and the other along the 
   lower lows, should converge as the pattern progresses. This creates the visual 
   effect of a tightening wedge.</li>

   <li><strong>Decreasing volume:</strong> As the price oscillates within the wedge, trading volume typically 
      tends to decrease. This suggests that buyers are losing interest and 
      sellers are gaining control.</li>

      <li><strong>Breakout:</strong> The breakout, which confirms the pattern, occurs when the price breaks below the 
         lower trendline with significant volume. This signifies a potential downward trend continuation.</li>

</ol>

Here are some additional points to remember about bearish rising wedges:
<ol type="a">
   <li>While rising wedges are generally considered bearish, they can sometimes act as 
      continuation patterns within a downtrend.</li>
   
      <li> The reliability of the pattern increases with the presence of 
         strong confirmation signals, such as high volume on the breakout or 
         bearish divergence with a technical indicator like the Relative Strength Index (RSI).</li>
   
         <li>Bearish rising wedges are not foolproof indicators and should be used in conjunction with other 
            technical analysis tools and fundamental analysis to make informed trading decisions.</li>
   
   </ol>
