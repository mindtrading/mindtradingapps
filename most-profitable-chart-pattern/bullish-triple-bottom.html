<p><strong>Implication</strong></p>
<p>A Triple Bottom is considered a bullish signal, indicating a possible reversal of the current downtrend to a new uptrend.</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>The Triple Bottom is composed of three sharp lows, all at about the same price level. Investors should note that the three lows tend to be sharp. While the three lows should be sharp and distinct, the highs of the pattern can appear to be rounded. The pattern is complete when prices rise above the highest high in the formation. The highest high is called the "confirmation point".</p>
<p>The highs should be fairly rounded in shape, although it is not absolutely necessary for the validity of the pattern.</p>
<p>The Triple Bottom is a reversal pattern and illustrates a downtrend in the process of becoming an uptrend. It is, therefore, vital to the validity of the pattern that it commence with prices moving in a downtrend.</p>

<p>Generally, volume in a Triple Bottom tends to trend downward as the pattern forms. Volume tends to be lighter on each successive low. Volume then picks up as prices rise above the confirmation point and break into the new upward trend.</p>
<p>An investor should not dismiss a Triple Bottom if volume does not display this pattern. The pattern can take several months to form and, during that time, volume can be irregular and unpredictable. Volume should be higher at the lows than on the days leading to the lows.</p>
<p><strong>Important Characteristics</strong></p>
<p>Following are important characteristics that should be noted for a Triple Bottom.</p>
<p><strong>Duration of the Pattern</strong></p>
<p>The Triple Bottom usually takes longer than other patterns to develop. The longer the pattern takes to form, the greater the significance of the price move once breakout occurs. Need for a Downtrend The Triple Bottom is a reversal pattern. This means it is essential to the validity of the pattern that it begins with a downward trend in a stock's price.</p>
<p><strong>Volume</strong></p>
<p>It is typical to see volume diminish as the pattern progresses. This changes however, when breakout occurs. A valid breakout will be accompanied by a burst in volume. Certain experts are less concerned by seeing a steadily diminishing trend in volume as the pattern progresses through its three lows.</p>
<p><strong>Pullback after Breakout</strong></p>
<p>It is very common in the Triple Bottom to see a pullback after the breakout.</p>
<p><strong>Symmetry</strong></p>
<p>Investors looking for a valid Triple Bottom should be wary of a pattern that shows a lot of white space as it is developing. The pattern should display a fairly regular progression among the three, well-separated lows. The symmetry of this pattern is something that should catch your eye.</p>
<p><strong>Trading</strong></p>
<p><strong>Considerations Duration</strong></p>
<p>Consider the duration of the pattern and its relationship to your trading time horizons. The duration of the pattern is considered to be an indicator of the duration of the influence of this pattern. The longer the pattern the longer it will take for the price to move to its target. The shorter the pattern the sooner the price move. If you are considering a short-term trading opportunity, look for a pattern with a short duration. If you are considering a longer-term trading opportunity, look for a pattern with a longer duration.</p>
<p><strong>Target Price</strong></p>
<p>The target price provides an important indication about the potential price move that this pattern indicates. Consider whether the target price for this pattern is sufficient to provide adequate returns after your costs (such as commissions) have been taken into account. A good rule of thumb is that the target price must indicate a potential return of greater than 5% before a pattern should be considered useful. However you must consider the current price and the volume of shares you intend to trade. Also, check that the target price has not already been achieved.</p>
<p><strong>Inbound</strong></p>
<p>Trend The inbound trend is an important characteristic of the pattern. A shallow inbound trend may indicate a period of consolidation before the price move indicated by the pattern begins. Look for an inbound trend that is longer than the duration of the pattern. A good rule of thumb is that the inbound trend should be at least two times the duration of the pattern.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Criteria that Support</strong></p>
<p><strong>Support and Resistance</strong></p>
<p>Look for a region of support or resistance around the target price. A region of price consolidation or a strong Support and Resistance Line at or around the target price is a strong indicator that the price will move to that point.</p>
<p><strong>Location of Moving Average</strong></p>
<p>The Triple Bottom should be below the Moving Average. Compare the location of the pattern to a Moving Average of appropriate length. For short duration patterns use a 50 day Moving Average, for longer patterns use a 200 day Moving Average.</p>
<p><strong>Moving Average Trend</strong></p>
<p>The Moving Average should change direction within the duration of the pattern and should head in the direction indicated by the pattern. For short duration patterns use a 50 day Moving Average, for longer patterns use a 200 day Moving Average.</p>
<p><strong>Volume</strong></p>
<p>A strong volume spike on the day of the pattern confirmation is a strong indicator in support of the potential for this pattern. The volume spike should be significantly above the average of the volume for the duration of the pattern. In addition, the volume within the duration of the pattern should be declining on average.</p>
<p><strong>Other Patterns</strong></p>
<p>Other reversal patterns (such as Bullish and Bearish Engulfing Lines and Islands) that occur at the peaks and valleys indicate strong resistance at those points. The presence of these patterns inside a Triple Bottom is a strong indication in support of this pattern.</p>
<p><strong>Criteria that Refute</strong></p>
<p><strong>No Volume Spike on Confirmation</strong></p>
<p>The lack of a volume spike on the day of the pattern confirmation is an indication that this pattern may not be reliable. In addition, if the volume has remained constant, or was increasing, over the duration of the pattern, then this pattern should be considered less reliable.</p>
<p><strong>Location of Moving Average</strong></p>
<p>The Triple Bottom should be below the Moving Average. Compare the location of the pattern to a Moving Average of appropriate length. For short duration patterns use a 50 day Moving Average, for longer patterns use a 200 day Moving Average. If the Triple Bottom is above the Moving Average then this pattern should be considered less reliable.</p>
<p><strong>Moving Average Trend</strong></p>
<p>A Moving Average that is trending in the opposite direction to that indicated by the pattern is an indication that this pattern is less reliable. Look at the direction of the Moving Average Trend. For short duration patterns use a 50 day Moving Average, for longer patterns use a 200 day Moving Average.</p>
<p><strong>Short Inbound Trend</strong></p>
<p>An inbound trend that is significantly shorter than the pattern duration is an indication that this pattern should be considered less reliable.</p>
<p><strong>Underlying Behavior</strong></p>
<p>The Triple Bottom pattern is composed of three sharp lows, all at about the same price level. When prices hit the first low, sellers become scarce, believing prices have fallen too low. If a seller does agree to sell, buyers are quick to buy at a good price. Prices then bounce back up. The support level is established and the next two lows also are sharp and quick.</p>
