<p class="article">

   Bearish rectangle pattern is a trend continuation chart pattern of a downtrend, 
   formed by a temporary consolidation between two down movements. This pattern typically 
   appears as a rectangle, thus the name.<br><br>
    
   The bearish rectangle pattern signals a strong downtrend, and traders often use it as an 
   opportunity for trading. To enter the pattern, traders usually look to break the lower support 
   level of the rectangle.<br><br>
    
   The height of the rectangle is the distance between the rectangle's edges. The width of the 
   rectangle is the distance of the time duration across both sides of the rectangle.<br><br>
   
   The bearish rectangle pattern is not a reliable trading pattern, but it indicates a strong 
   downtrend and traders generally use it as an opportunity for trading.
