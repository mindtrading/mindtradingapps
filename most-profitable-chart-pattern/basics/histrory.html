    <strong>History of the candlestick</strong><br><br>
    
    Candlestick charts were first used by rice traders in Japan during the 1700s to 1800s. 
    They then made their way to America in the 1990s and gradually became popular in stock 
    markets worldwide among traders and investors<br><br>

    <strong>Let's delve a bit more into candlestick patterns.</strong><br><br>


    Candlestick charts were developed in Japan, a full century before the invention of bar 
    charts and point-and-figure charts in Western countries. In the 1700s, a Japanese man 
    named Homa recognized the relationship between rice prices, supply and demand, and traders' 
    emotions, resulting in a profound impact on markets.<br><br>

    A daily candlestick chart presents the opening, highest, lowest, and closing price of 
    a share for a particular day. The "real body," which is the broad or rectangular part 
    of the candlestick, marks the range between the opening and closing prices. It gives a 
    clear representation of the price range for that day's trading.
