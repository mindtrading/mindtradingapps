   <strong>Implication</strong><br><br>

   A Diamond Top is considered a bearish signal, indicating a possible reversal of the 
   current uptrend to a new downtrend.<br><br>
   
   <strong>Description</strong><br><br>
   
   Diamond patterns usually form over several months in very active markets. 
   Volume remains high during the formation of this pattern. The Diamond Top 
   indicates a reversal to a downtrend.<br></br>
   
   The Diamond Top pattern occurs because prices create higher highs and lower lows in a broadening pattern. 
   Then the trading range gradually narrows after the highs peak and the lows start trending upward. 
   The Technical Event occurs when prices break downward out of the diamond formation.<br></br>

   <strong>Trading Considerations</strong>


   <strong>Duration of Pattern</strong><br></br>

   Consider the duration of the pattern and its relationship to your trading time horizons. 
   The duration of the pattern is considered to be an indicator of the duration of the 
   influence of this pattern. The longer the pattern the longer it will take for the price 
   to move to its target. The shorter the pattern the sooner the price move. If you are 
   considering a short-term trading opportunity, look for a pattern with a short duration. 
   If you are considering a longer-term trading opportunity, 
   look for a pattern with a longer duration.<br></br>

   <strong>Target Price</strong><br></br>

   The target price provides an important indication about the potential price move that this 
   pattern indicates. Consider whether the target price for this pattern is sufficient 
   to provide adequate returns after your costs (such as commissions) have been taken into account. 
   A good rule of thumb is that the target price must indicate a 
   potential return of greater than 5% before a pattern should be considered useful. 
   However you must consider the current price and the volume of shares you intend to trade. 
   Also, check that the target price has not already been achieved. <br></br>

   <strong>Inbound Trend</strong><br></br>

   The inbound trend is an important characteristic of the pattern. 
   A shallow inbound trend may indicate a period of consolidation before 
   the price move indicated by the pattern begins. Look for an inbound trend that 
   is longer than the duration of the pattern. A good rule of thumb is that 
   the inbound trend should be at least 2 times the duration of the pattern. <br></br>

   <strong>Criteria that Support</strong><br></br>
   <strong>Support and Resistance</strong><br></br>

   Support can be found at the turning point of the lows and resistance at 
   the top peak of the Diamond.<br></br>

   <strong> Moving Average</strong><br></br>

   Watch for the 200-day Moving Average to flatten out. Then watch for the 50-day Moving 
   Average to cross below the 200-day Moving Average. This should signal the breakout.<br></br>

   <strong>Criteria that Refute</strong><br></br>
   <strong>No Volume</strong><br></br>

   A lack of a volume throughout the pattern is an indication that this pattern may not be reliable.<br></br>

   <strong>Short Inbound Trend</strong><br></br>

   An inbound trend that is significantly shorter than the pattern duration is an 
   indication that this pattern should be considered less reliable.<br></br>
