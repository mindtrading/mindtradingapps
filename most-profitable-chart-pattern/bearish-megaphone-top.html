    
 <p><strong>Implication </strong></p>
 <p>A Megaphone Top also known as a Broadening Top is considered a bearish signal, indicating that the current uptrend may reverse to form a new downtrend.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><strong>Description</strong></p>
 <p>A Megaphone Top is a relatively rare formation and is also known as a Broadening Top. Its shape is opposite to that of a Symmetrical Triangle. The pattern develops after a strong advance in prices and can last several weeks or even a few months.</p>
 <p>A Megaphone Top is formed because the prices make a series of higher highs and lower lows. The Megaphone Top usually consists of three ascending peaks and two descending troughs. The signal that the pattern is complete occurs when prices fall below the lower low.&nbsp;</p>

 <p>Volume in the Megaphone Top usually peaks along with prices. It is usual to see trading volumes increase or remain high during the formation of this pattern. The eventual breakout and reversal can be difficult to identify at the time of its occurrence because volume does not appear unusual.</p>
 <p><strong>Trading Considerations</strong></p>
 <p>Target Price</p>
 <p>The target price provides an important indication about the potential price move that this pattern indicates. Consider whether the target price for this pattern is sufficient to provide adequate returns after your costs (such as commissions) have been taken into account. A good rule of thumb is that the target price must indicate a potential return of greater than 5% before a pattern should be considered useful, however you must consider the current price and the volume of shares you intend to trade.</p>
 <p><strong>Criteria that Support</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Volume</strong></p>
 <p>Volume in the Megaphone Top usually peaks along with prices. A strong volume spike on the day of the pattern confirmation is a strong indicator in support of the potential for this pattern.</p>
 <p><strong>Underlying</strong></p>
 <p>Behavior The creation of the pattern reflects a period of time when bulls and bears are battling to gain control of the stock. The pattern occurs after the bulls have been charging and driving the stock price appreciably higher. During the formation of the Megaphone Top, however, bears are exerting increasing influence on the price and causing it to set a series of lower lows. The increasing volatility eventually creates a sense of uncertainty, leads to profit-taking, and deters some of the bulls from making any further commitments. The bears eventually triumph.</p>
