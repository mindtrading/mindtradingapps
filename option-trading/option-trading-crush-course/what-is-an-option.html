    <h3>What is an Option?</h3>
    <p>
        Let’s start out with a basic overview of what options are. An option is a
contract that confers upon you the right to buy or sell an underlying stock at
what’s known as a “specified strike price.” It comes with a deadline—a date
by which you must buy or sell in order to attain that price.
    </p>
    
  
    <p>
        You are not obligated to buy or sell by that date— hence, it is called an
“option” rather than a “demand.” However, the cost of purchasing that
possibility is set at a premium.

    </p>
    

    <p>
        There are two contract types on offer: one allows you to buy a stock at a
        specified price, which is known as a “call,” and the other allows you to sell
        a stock at a specified price, which is called a “put.”
    </p>
    
    <p>

        In order to start options trading, you first need to select a broker and open a
        “margin account.” Those accounts usually have a minimum starting amount
        attached to them that is often set at around $5,000.<br><br>

        Those are the basics of options trading, but what does it actually mean and
        why would you want to do it? That is where the risk comes in because
        options trading is all about predicting what a certain stock is going to do in
        the near future.<br><br>

        To illustrate, let’s use an example that’s easily familiar from everyday life
        such as buying a car. You’ve been saving up for a few months, but you’re
        not quite ready to head to the dealership—except, one day, you drive past a
        local salesroom and spot the hatchback of your dreams.<br><br>
        
        Because you want to buy that car, you decide to speak with the dealer and
        negotiate. You work out a deal that will allow you to buy the vehicle from
        him in two months for the price of $10,000. Because the dealer is agreeing
        to keep the car for you and fix the price, you will also be paying $300 to
        secure that option for yourself.
        


    </p>
    <h3>The two months start to pass and one of two things might happen:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            The dealer opens the hood of the vehicle and discovers it has an
engine system that’s completely one of a kind and was a test by
the manufacturer. That makes the car ultra-valuable as a
collector’s item. Under normal circumstances, the dealer would
instantly double its asking price—but, because he made an
agreement with you, he can’t. He is obligated to sell that car to
you as long as you buy it before the two months are up.
Obviously, you’re keen to exercise that right, so, you purchase
the car for $10,000 and decide to sell it for $20,000—doubling
your money in the process.
        </li>
        <li>
            The dealer opens the trunk of the vehicle and discovers that it
contains a dead body. It’s removed and the car is cleaned but the
police investigation causes quite a bit of damage. The value of
the vehicle halves and, under normal circumstances, the dealer
would slash the asking price to $5,000. However, because you
entered into the agreement, the dealer must still sell you that car
at the agreed price of $10,000. On the other hand, because you as
the buyer are not obligated to make the purchase, you can always
decide to walk away and see what the Toyota dealer has in stock
instead. You won’t have lost because of the $5,000 value, but the
dealer will get to keep the $300 you paid to create the
opportunity for yourself in the first place.

        </li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>That, in a nutshell, is how options trading works. As the buyer of an option,
        you are in exactly the same position as you would be if you had gone out to
        buy that car. You cannot know what the future will bring—and it does have
        a habit of throwing out the unexpected—but you can make a decent
        prediction.
        </p>

<p>Now, let’s zoom in a little bit closer. Though options trading really is as
    simple as the example we just looked at, there are a few more things you
    need to know in more detail before we move on.    
    </p>


    <h3>First, as mentioned above, there are two types of options:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Calls:</strong> They give the right to BUY an asset at a specified price
            before the time limit expires. You’d do this, for example, if you
            felt confident that a certain stock was going to continue rising in
            price for a period of time. The call allows you to purchase that
            stock at a lower price at a time when it has risen to a much
            greater value.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Puts:</strong> They give the right to SELL an asset at a specified price
                before the time limit expires. You’d do this, for example, if you
                felt confident that a certain stock was going to continue dropping
                in price for a period of time. That would allow you to sell that
                stock at a higher price at a time when it is worth a whole lot less.
                </li>
    </ol>


    <p>Let’s translate what we know into a trading example so that you can see
        how options trading works in the real world. This time, we’ll look at a put
        because, as you are now aware, the example of purchasing a vehicle was an
        illustration of a call—you obtained the right to BUY before the deadline.<br><br>

        This time, we’ll look at what might happen if you purchased a put option
        which would give you the right but not the obligation to SELL before a
        deadline. We’ll assume you’re looking at a particular stock in your portfolio
        that is currently trading at $1. Knowing the market, you have predicted that
        it is going to drop to $0.50 within the next three months.<br><br>

        You purchase an option with a trader that will allow you to sell the stock in
        three months at $0.75. If, during the interim, it turns out you are correct and
        the stock drops to $0.50 you have made a profit of $0.25 on the sale. If, on
        the other hand, you were wrong in your prediction and the stock climbs to
        $1.20 you have no obligation to sell it and lose that $0.20 profit.<br><br>

        To understand this example fully, it’s important to know the difference
        between a buyer and a seller as it’s likely that you’ll end up filling both
        roles over the course of your options trading experience.
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>A buyer is NOT OBLIGATED to actually buy or sell the stock
                when the deadline arrives. What he or she has bought is the right
                to make that purchase or sale but it is not an obligation.</li>
                <li>A seller is OBLIGATED to buy or sell the stock when the
                    deadline arrives. As the seller, you made a promise when the
                    contract was agreed to and you must fulfill it when the time
                    comes no matter what the consequences might be.<br>
                    If follows, therefore, that you could find yourself in four very different
                    situations during an options trading event. Let’s outline them for your
                    reference as that is often where it can start to seem confusing.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Call buyer—</strong>you have the choice to buy a stock at the deadline
                        but you are not obligated to do so.</li>
                     <li><strong>Put buyer—</strong>you have the choice to sell a stock at the deadline
                            but you are not obligated to do so.</li>
                    <li><strong> Call seller—</strong> you are obligated to sell a stock at the deadline and
                        you will keep the premium that was included to secure the deal.
                        </li>
                    <li><string>Put seller—</string>you are obligated to buy a stock at the deadline and
                        you will keep the premium that was included to secure the deal.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>There are more intricacies to options trading but we’ll cover those in more
            detail later. First, make sure you have a full understanding of the basics—
            they are the essence of options trading and the heart of your experience as a
            trader.</p>
