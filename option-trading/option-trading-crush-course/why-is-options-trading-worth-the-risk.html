   <h3> Why is Options trading Worth the Risk?</h3>
  <p> So, what’s the point of all this horse trading? If, while reading the previous
    chapters, it seemed that options trading involves a lot of risk and an
    uncertain gain, you might be interested to know that that’s not necessarily
    the case. It all depends how you go about trading your options.<br><br>

    While, yes, you can place your focus on a whole slew of risky ventures and
    you would stand to either lose a fortune or gain even more, that’s not the
    only way to trade options. Let’s take a look at the advantages of options
    trading.</p> 
    <ol>

    
    <li>When you trade in options, the uncertainty lessens. You create an
    option that tells you exactly how much you will either lose or
    gain once the deadline arrives—unlike trading in stocks, you are
    not at the mercy of the markets. You have confirmation from the
    outset as to what you will either receive or spend on a particular
    date.</li>

   <li> Generally, options are more versatile than stocks and that means
    you can make money no matter what the state of the market is. It
    doesn’t matter if stocks are dropping, as it would if you were
    simply trading in stocks. With an option strategy, you can take
    advantage of what’s happening in the markets in either direction.</li>

    <li> You can also use options trading as a form of security to protect
    your investments. That might sound strange, but it’s actually a
    very common strategy known as “hedging.” If, for instance, you
    are concerned that a stock you own a large amount of is set to
    drop, but you’re not completely sure, you can use an options
    trade to protect yourself against that possibility. You would
    simply buy a put that would allow you to sell that stock at a
    greatly reduced loss at the deadline—you wouldn’t be obligated
    to make that sale if you turned out to be wrong but you can do so
    if your fears prove to be well founded.</li>

    <li>  You can also “hedge” to protect yourself against risk altogether.
    If it seems that the market as a whole is set to drop over the
    coming months, you can hedge your entire portfolio by buying
    exchange-traded funds. Those will actually gain value as the
    market drops in value—it’s a very common strategy among the
    experts.</li>

    <li>  The opposite of “hedge” is to “speculate” and it’s one of the
    most profitable ways to invest if it’s done properly. Beware,
    however, that it is also the strategy that carries the most risk. By
    speculating, you can leverage the investments you have made
    and you have the chance to make a lot of money in the process—
    all for a relatively small cost.</li>

    <li> Finally, arguably the most important advantage of options
    trading is that you don’t need to know the complicated and
    advanced strategies in order to prevail. Actually, it’s the simple
    strategies that are very often the best. That means you can dive
    into options trading with the confidence that you can learn as
    you go without sacrificing your potential for profit.</li>
</ol>
