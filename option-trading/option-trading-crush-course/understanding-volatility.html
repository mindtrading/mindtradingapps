        <h3>Understanding Volatility</h3>
      <p> There’s one final factor that affects the prices of contracts on a fundamental
        basis and it’s not really something we’ve touched on so far. The volatility of
        a contract is, however, an incredibly important concept to grasp for an
        options trader.<br><br>
        Volatility refers to the movement of the underlying stock. Some stocks will
        slowly wend their way up and down in a predictable manner and those
        stocks are not very volatile. Others change up and down on a day-to-day
        basis.<br><br>
        To sum up the effect of volatility in a single sentence—the more volatile the
        stock, the more that an options trader is willing to pay for it. A volatile
        stock has a better chance of reaching a strike price and perhaps shooting far
        beyond it before the expiration date.<br><br>
        However, volatility is also the most dangerous of the factors that you need
        to bear in mind because it’s arguably the most likely one to force you into a
        bad decision. A volatile stock, for example, can lead to a much higher
        premium and, therefore, a higher contract price. Unless that stock shoots
        through the roof, you could actually end up losing money even when you
        should be making it.<br><br>
        One way to estimate the volatility of a stock is to take a look at what it has
        done in the recent past. That tells you how much it has moved up and down
        already, which is what some use as an indicator of how much it will move
        up and down in the future.<br><br>
        Unfortunately, it’s not always true that the past repeats itself and you can’t
        predict the future based on what’s already happened. Instead, options
        traders use “implied volatility” to make their guesses and that is the value
        that the market believes the option is worth.</p> 


        <p>   You can see that reflected in the activity on the options for that stock.
        Buyers will be keen to get their hands on options before a certain event
        takes place, such as the announcement of a new product or a release about
        the company’s earnings. Because of that, options increase in price because
        there is implied volatility. The market thinks the stock is going to shoot up.<br><br>

        You’ll see lower demand on a stock that’s flat or moving gently because
        there is no implied volatility and, therefore, no hurry to get in on the action.
        You’ll also see correspondingly low prices for options on that stock.<br><br>

        Volatility is obviously a good thing. As a buyer, you want the stock to be
        volatile because you need it to climb to the strike price and beyond.
        However, there is also such a thing as too much volatility. It’s at that point
        that contracts become popular, the prices rise, and you stand to pay more for
        a contract than you will ultimately profit from.<br><br>

        Your broker will likely be able to provide you with a program that will help
        you determine implied volatility by asking you to enter certain factors and
        then calculating it for you. However, it’s only with experience that you’ll
        learn how to spot a stock that’s just volatile enough to justify its higher
        price. Again, practice is key.<br><br>

        It’s also worth noting that a lot of the risk in options trading comes from
        volatility largely because it’s impossible to be accurate in your estimates.
        What happens if an earthquake destroys a company’s headquarters? That
        stock will plummet and you had absolutely no way to see it coming.<br><br>

        That’s why options traders are forced to accept that their fancy formulas are
        not going to be perfect predictors. They will help but you should still be
        conservative in your trading and avoid the temptation to sink everything
        into a trade that you believe could make your fortune thanks to its volatility.
