<h3>Stepping Up a Tier: Buying Calls</h3>
<p>We’re ready to move on to the more sophisticated areas of options trading.
    You have tested the waters, made a little cash, and you feel comfortable
    with the mechanics of the market. Now, you can start actually buying calls
    and begin to hopefully make some real money.<br><br>

    It’s actually simple to buy a call in terms of physically going ahead and
    doing it. However, it’s not quite so easy to make a profit. You’re going to
    need to start small and dedicate yourself to a learning curve—and you need
    to understand that there is a risk involved in buying calls, so, you don’t
    want to stake your life savings on your efforts.<br><br>

    My advice is that you build up slowly over time rather than jumping
    straight in with several buys in a single day. Be circumspect about your
    actions. A small profit is better than no profit at all. Save your riskiest ideas
    for when you’ve set up a nest egg with your sells and you feel confident
    enough in your own judgment that you’re as sure as it’s possible to be that
    your risk will pay off.<br><br>

    As a reminder, what you are actually doing when you buy a call is
    purchasing the right to buy the underlying stock if it reaches the strike price
    before the deadline. You aren’t obligated to buy it. If you choose not to, all
    you have lost is the premium you paid for that right.<br><br>

    The best-case scenario for you, as the buyer, is that the stock suddenly starts
    rising at a high speed before the expiration date arrives. You want it to go
    beyond the strike price so that, when it comes time to exercise your right,
    you are purchasing your stock at a lower price than it is now worth.
    Obviously, you then have the option to instantly list that stock as a covered
    sell, which would allow you to realize more profit in real money.<br><br>

    That final piece of the puzzle is the important one. As an options trader, you
    are not in the business of building a stock portfolio. You don’t really want
    to actually own shares—you want to make a profit on them as they pass
    through your hands. You want to buy them for less than they are worth and
    then sell them for more than they are worth if you are lucky. It’s within
    those transactions that your money will be made.</p>

    
   <h3>Buying calls has several advantages for you as an options trader.</h3> 

    <li> It doesn’t cost much to get involved in the movement of a
    particular stock. You only need fork out the amount for the
    premium. You can sit back and wait to see what the stock does
    before making your purchase decision based on actual
    information rather than on speculating what the market will do.</li>

   <li> It allows you to make use of the kinds of “tips” that market
    experts have a bad habit of swearing by. You read the news,
    you’re watching the markets, and you have information that
    makes you think a certain stock is about to rise fast and hard.
    You want to take advantage of that, obviously, and options
    trading allows you to do so in a safe way rather than simply
    buying the stock. If you’re wrong, you’ll only lose your
    premium and you may even make a small profit. If you
    purchased the stock and then it plummeted rather than rose, you
    stand to lose a whole lot more cash.</li>

    <li> Buying calls also allows you to consider shares that would
    ordinarily be out of your price range. You can play around with
    the big boys, like Walmart and Apple without putting a second
    mortgage on the house. Buying options on those stocks is a
    whole lot less expensive than buying the stocks themselves, so,
    if you see something on the horizon that makes you think the
    trade would be worthwhile—like a new product or service, for
    instance, or a change in leadership—you can use call buying to
    get in on the game. That is called “leverage” which is the ability
    to control thousands of dollars in stock for just hundreds of
    dollars in premiums.</li>
    
    <p>One thing to note before you start buying calls is that you’ll want to wait for
        the right time. You are no longer interested in a flat market. This time, you
        want a bull market where stock prices are rising.</p>


        <p><img src="img/3.webp"/></p>

        <p>What you are looking for is an underlying stock you have faith in. You
            think it’s going to rise in value over the next few months. Let’s say you’ve
            found a stock that’s currently at $40 and you believe it will continue to rise
            steadily. Predicting the rate of its growth, you think it will be at $80 in two
            months’ time.<br><br>

            What you would be looking for in that scenario is a call contract that would
            allow you to purchase shares for LESS than the $80 you think they will rise
            to in two months. You must also juggle the math to make sure that you will
            not be paying a premium that would wipe out the profit you would make.<br><br>

            Using the profit and loss diagram as an example, if you are bullish on stock
            ABC trading at $35 per share, you might buy calls thirty days from
            expiration with a strike price of $40 and a cost of $0.20 per share or $20 per
            contract. Let’s do the math and remember that one option contract equals
            100 shares.<br><br>

            Purchasing 100 shares of ABC at $35 would cost $3500. However, for the
            same $3500 you could buy 175 contracts of $40 calls and control 17,500
            shares.<br><br>

            Imagine ABC hits $42 within the next thirty days and the $40 calls trade at
            $1.05 just prior to expiration. You’d make about $29,921.10 in a month,
            theoretically.<br><br>
        
        
            If ABC finishes less than the $40 strike price, the loss is limited to the price
            paid for the call option ($200 maximum loss in the diagram).<br><br>


            Bear in mind, of course, that you won’t walk away from a call option with
            cash in hand. The profit we are talking about in this case is “intrinsic
            value.” You can now take that stock and write a covered call on it,
            hopefully selling it, and making a tangible profit in the process. That was
            what we were discussing in the previous chapter. As an options trader,
            you’re not looking to hold a stock portfolio. You’re purchasing stocks with
            call contracts in order to turn around and sell for a profit.</p>
