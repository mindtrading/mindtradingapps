    Walking you through the learning curve of options trading will always start
    with the most basic move you’ll need to make—setting yourself up in a
    position to actually be able to trade.<br><br>

    To trade in options, you’re going to need an options account. Don’t worry,
    we’re going to talk a whole lot more in the coming chapters about what to
    do with your account once you have it. For now, it’s important that you
    know your starting point and just how easy it is to reach it.<br><br>

    One thing to know before you pick your firm is that times have changed
    considerably over the last couple of decades when it comes to options
    trading. Back before the internet became such a constant part of our lives,
    your brokerage firm—or, at least, your personal representative at the firm—
    would make your options trades on your behalf and you paid a hefty price
    for their services. Nowadays, however, you’ll be doing most of your trades
    yourself.<br><br>

    Commissions for your representative is, thus, a whole lot lower than it used
    to be which means it won’t cost you an arm and both legs to rely on your
    rep in the early days of your experience with options. While you are
    learning, feel free to make use of your firm’s services to place and confirm
    your trades if it helps you to feel more comfortable getting to know the
    process.<br><br>

    With that in mind, there are going to be certain things to look for when you
    select your firm.
</p>
<ol>

    <li>Compare commission prices to make sure you’re getting a great
        deal.</li>
       <li> Make sure the firm has up-to-date software and is capable of
        setting up trades quickly and reliably to make sure you get the
        trades you want at the best prices.</li>
        <li>Check out the hours of service to ensure the firm is compatible
            with your needs. In these days of online firms, you could be
            dealing with a firm that’s across the ocean from the markets you
            have an interest in. Or you might find that a firm only makes its
            reps available for the length of the working day and that might
            not suit your own timing.
            </li>
         <li>Speak personally with the reps at the firm because these are the
                people who are going to help you during the process of setting
                up your strategy. You want someone who is personable and
                knowledgeable—and, most importantly, who speaks in terms
                that you personally find easy to comprehend.</li>
           <li>
                Take a look at the additional services the firm supplies. Many
                will offer learning materials, guides, and even classes or
                webinars to help you hone your strategies. Even if you feel that
                you already know what you need to know, there’s no harm in a
                refresher course or a little nugget of inspiration every once in
                awhile.
          </li>
</ol>

<p>Once you select a firm, you’ll then need to consider signing a “margin
    agreement” with that firm. That agreement allows you to borrow money
    from the firm in order to purchase your stocks, which is known as “buying
    on margin.”<br><br>

    Understandably, your brokerage firm is not going to allow you to buy on
    margin if you don’t have the financial status to pay them back. They will,
    therefore, run a credit check on you and ask you for information about your
    resources and your knowledge.<br><br>

    A margin account is not a necessity for options trading—you don’t actually
    use margin to purchase an option because it must be paid for in full.
    However, a margin account can be useful as you graduate to more advanced
    strategies and, in some cases, it will be obligatory. If you opt to sign a
    margin agreement, talk it through thoroughly with the firm as there are
    certain restrictions on the type of money you can use that may apply to you.</p>

    <p>Next, you’ll need to sign an “options agreement.” This time, it’s an
        obligatory step. That agreement is designed to figure out how much you
        know about options and how much experience you have with trading them.
        It also aims to ensure that you are absolutely aware of the risks you take by
        trading options and it is to make sure that you are financially able to handle
        those risks.<br><br>
        By ascertaining those things, your firm can determine what level of options
        trading you should be aiming for. It will, therefore, approve your “trading
        level” and there are five levels.
        </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Level 1: You may sell covered calls.
        </li>
        <li>Level 2: You may buy calls and puts and also buy strangles,
            straddles, and collars. You may also sell puts that are covered by
            cash and by options on exchange-traded funds and indexes.</li>
           <li> Level 3: You may utilize credit and debit spreads.</li>
           <li> Level 4: You may sell “naked puts,” straddles, and strangles.
            Level 5: You may sell “naked indexes” and “index spreads.”</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Don’t worry if you’re not sure yet what each of those things means. You
        will understand them by the time you finish reading this book. For now, all
        you need to be aware of is that your firm will determine what level is
        appropriate for you. As a beginner, don’t be surprised if you only reach the
        first two levels.<br><br>
        Once you’ve signed the option agreement, you’ll be handed a booklet that
        contains a mine of information about the risks and rewards within options
        trading. Right now, if you were to read that booklet, it would seem to be in
        a foreign language. By the time you finish this crash course, it will be a lot
        more understandable—and it’s very important for your success that you do
        read it.</p>
        <p>Finally, your firm will present you with a “standardized option contract.”
            It’s the same for every trader, which means you stand the same chance of
            success as every other person out there in the options market.<br><br>

            By trading an option, you are entering into a legal agreement that is insured
            by the Options Clearing Corporation, which guarantees the contract will be
            honored in full. Make sure you read that contract to be aware of not only
            the rights you have as a trader, but also the obligations you must follow in
            the same role.</p>
            <p>Congratulations, you now have an options account. That is the conduit
                through which you will create and implement your strategies and begin
                your adventure in options trading</p>
