        <h3>Strategies for New Options Traders</h3>
        <p>Options strategies are divided in two in terms of how they are constructed.
            We have the single-leg and the multi-leg options strategies. Single calls and
            puts are the building blocks for every possible options strategy you might
            use in the market. An example is buying one put or selling one call. Those
            single-leg options strategies are more than fine to use. When you start
            combining options of different types and strikes, however, you have the
            ability to create a multi-leg strategy that profits from whatever assumptions
            you have about a stock. More importantly, you can both define risk and
            increase your profit potential by using multi-leg strategies.</p>
            <p>Now, for some of those all-important strategies you’ve been waiting for.</p>
        
        <li><strong>Straddling a Stock:</strong><br>
        <img src="img/5.webp"/><br>
        If you are good at spotting market trends, this strategy is for you.
        Let’s say that you think a company is about to have a big event or
        release an announcement, but you don’t know exactly what that will
        do to its shares. You just think that it’s bound to affect them. You
        could use a straddle strategy to purchase both a put and a call option
        at the same strike price, setting the expiration shortly after the date of
        the event in question. <br><br>
        The market outlook for that strategy is to look for a major move,
        either up or down, in the underlying stock before expiration. That
        market-neutral strategy is specifically designed for highly volatile
        conditions where stocks are swinging wildly back and forth.
        To set up that trade, buy one at-the-money call and one at-the-money
        put at the same strike price.
        <li>The maximum potential profit for that strategy is unlimited
            and it occurs if the underlying stock keeps going up or it
            goes down.<br><br>
            Your breakeven point on that is going to need to factor in
            both trades. You need to be doubling your profit, in other
            words, to justify the spend on two contracts.
            The maximum loss occurs if the underlying stock remains
            between the strike prices until expiration. For example, in
            the diagram above, maximum loss occurs if the stock price
            remains at $40.<br><br>
            Therefore, you’ll need to include that thought in your
            choice of strike price and you’ll need to watch out for
            volatility. You need higher implied volatility for that to
            work. That strategy is best used with extremely volatile
            stocks. Since we want a big move in either direction, an
            increase in implied volatility would have a very positive
            impact on the strategy. Time decay or theta works
            negatively and impacts the strategy. You should also be
            aware that you won’t be the only one who sees the change
            coming, so, the contracts could be pricey</li>
        </li>

        <li><strong>The Strangle:</strong><br>
            <p><img src="img/6.webp"/></p>
            That can be a better way to tackle the situation we just looked at. It’s
            the same idea except that the call and the put are set to different prices
            with the put strike price usually lower.<br><br>
            The short strangle could possibly be the ultimate strategy for options
            traders. Though it requires more capital in the form of margin with
            naked options on either side, those strategies offer the highest
            probability of success for any trade and, generally, the highest longterm P&L.
            The trade is best used when implied volatility is high and when you
            are looking for the stock to move in a defined range over the trading
            timeline.<br><br>
            To set up the trade, sell one out-of-the-money put and sell one out-ofthe-money call at far out strike prices. The result of both sales is a net
            credit, or premium received, which is the maximum potential profit
            for the strategy.<br><br>
            If the stock goes higher than the call strike price or lower than the put
            strike price, your losses could be substantial and theoretically
            unlimited.<br><br>
            All else being equal, falling volatility will generally help such a
            position while rising volatility will generally hurt the position.
            Time decay or theta works positively for you as part of such a
            position.<br><br>
            When you do that, you will break even if the stock rises above a
            certain price OR drops below a certain price, “strangling” the
            possibilities from both ends.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Bull Spreads:</strong></li>
            <p><img src="img/7.webp"/></p>
            <p>That strategy again tackles the question of, “What is going to happen
                to this stock?” It gives you a sure-fire way to see some cash but with
                the possibility of trading away a serious profit. Again, it’s all about
                flexibility. In an example, for a stock that’s now trading at $42, you
                could buy a call with a strike price of $40 and sell a call with a strike
                price of $45. You’ll likely pay more to buy your call than you gain
                from selling the second call. Let’s say it was $0.25 for the $40
                contract and $0.60 for the $45, leaving you paying $0.35 in total to
                set your position. For this to work best, you’re hoping that the stock
                will end up somewhere between $40 and $45 at the deadline because
                the second contract will not be exercised and you will make a profit.
                If it rises above the $45, you’ll still make a profit but it will be capped
                at that exact profit if your buyer exercises their right to purchase the
                stock. The downside is that your stock could skyrocket to $50 and
                you won’t see a profit above the $50 but that can be acceptable if
                you’re looking to cut down your costs and still make a profit. The
                example above is a bull spread.<br><br>

                To setup that trade, buy one in-the-money call and sell one out-of-themoney call at a higher strike price. The combination should result in a
                net debit. Entering those trades thirty to sixty days until expiration is
                preferred. Since option pricing is generally low, you’ll want to
                increase the trade duration and give yourself ample time for the stock
                to move into a profitable zone.<br><br>
                Because you’re both buying and selling a call, the potential effect of a
                decrease in implied volatility will be somewhat neutralized.
                The risk is limited to the net amount paid for the options. The time
                decay or theta on that strategy is neutral as the eroding value of the
                options purchased and sold cancel each other out.
                That can also work on a bear spread if you reverse the trades and sell
                your call lower than you buy your call.</p>

                <li><strong>Bear Spreads:</strong></li>
                <p><img src="img/8.webp"/></p>
                <p>This strategy is the direct opposite of the bull spread. To set up the
                    trade, buy one out-of-the-money call at a higher strike price and sell
                    one in-the-money call. The combination of options should result in a
                    net debit. Entering the trade thirty to sixty days until expiration is
                    preferred in order to give the stock time to move into a profitable
                    zone. Volatility is also neutral for that spread. The maximum potential
                    loss is limited to the amount paid for the options.</p>
                <li><strong>Iron Condor:</strong></li>
                <p><img src="img/9.webp"/></p>
                <p>A lot of options traders love the iron condor. It's a great marketneutral option strategy that you can employ any time the market gets
                    a little bit tilted and starts trading in a sideways fashion. The diagram
                    above is the profit and loss diagram for the iron condor. It has two
                    legs or two sides to it and is the combination of the bull and bear
                    spread. The iron condor is a strategy that's based on selling options
                    and collecting a premium up front for the trading month and then
                    hoping that those options expire worthless at the end of the expiration
                    cycle, allowing you to keep the full profit. It has a limited risk feature.
                    From the diagram above, here's what would happen if a stock were to
                    trade or were to close right at $35. You'd see, if the stock closed at
                    $35, that we'd actually lose $300. And if it closed anywhere below
                    $35, we'd actually lose $300.
                    </p>
                    <p>Now, you can see here that if the stock were to trade higher than $55,
                        then we would actually lose that same amount of money, that same
                        $300. If the stock were to actually close anywhere between those
                        values, however, let's say anywhere between $40 and $50, then we
                        would actually keep our $200 premium.
                        </p>
                        <p>You can think of that trade as bracketing the market and determining
                            two areas, an upper boundary and a lower boundary of where the
                            market will not trade, and then profiting and positioning to make
                            money if the market trades sideways.
                            </p>
                            <p>To set up that trade, sell one out-of-the-money put, buy one out-ofthe-money put at a lower strike price, sell one out-of-the-money call
                                and buy one out-of-the-money call at higher strike.
                                Entering those trades thirty to sixty days until expiration is preferred
                                and should allow you to collect enough premium after commission
                                costs to make the trade worth placing. Time decay or theta works
                                positively for as part of that position. Falling implied volatility will
                                generally help the position while rising implied volatility will
                                generally hurt the position. It is a great market-neutral strategy. You
                                don't have to guess and hope and pray that the stock rallies or falls. It
                                just has to stay within a wide range for you to keep your premium.</p>

                                <li><strong>Call (Ratio) Backspread:</strong></li>
                                <p><img src="img/10.webp"/></p>
                                <p>This is really a great strategy and an easy way to take a long position
                                    in a stock without taking the extra risk of a long option. The market
                                    outlook here is that you want to see a pretty significant upside move
                                    in the underlying stock. What you want to do with this is that you also
                                    want to keep your downside risk limited. The strategy has more
                                    limited downside risk as opposed to just a regular call option. The
                                    whole idea of the call backspread is to make one point the maximum
                                    loss point ($45 on the diagram). You actually might end up not
                                    making any money beyond that point but at least you won’t lose any
                                    money. 
                                    </p>
                                <p>To set up that strategy, sell one at-the-money call and buy two out-ofthe-money calls at a higher strike price. The combination of options
                                    should result in a net debit.<br><br>

                                    For example, you could sell one in-the-money $40 strike call and buy
                                    two out-of-the money $45 strike calls. You just want to sell twice as
                                    many. If you want to do the spread as selling two and buying four, or
                                    selling ten and buying twenty, you can do that. As long as you have
                                    that 1:2 ratio, you should be in good shape as far as building the
                                    strategy</p>

                              <p> The maximum loss would occur should the stock close right at the
                                upper strike price. If the stock closed right at $45, that would create
                                the maximum loss of $500 in the above case.<br><br>

                                That is actually a pretty good strategy for a market that is pretty
                                volatile and highly volatile in either direction. It’s not a good strategy
                                for sideways or neutral markets and it’s flat out horrible for those
                                types of markets. The profit potential for the strategy is technically
                                unlimited to the topside. Entering those trades sixty to ninety days
                                until expiration is preferred. Since option pricing is generally low,
                                you’ll want to increase the trade duration and give yourself ample
                                time for the stock to move into a profitable zone. That can also work
                                in a bearish situation if you reverse the trades and that will be
                                discussed next.</p> 

                    <li><strong>Put (Ratio) Backspread:</strong></li>
                     <p><img src="img/11.webp"/></p>

                     <p>The Put Backspread is the exact opposite of the Call Ratio
                        Backspread and it is used when you are bearish on the market
                        outlook. To set up the strategy, sell one at-the-money put and buy two
                        out-of-the-money puts at a lower strike price. The combination of
                        options should result in a net debit.<br><br>
                        Entering those trades sixty to ninety days until expiration is also
                        preferred. Since option pricing is generally low, you’ll want to
                        increase the trade duration and give yourself ample time for the stock
                        to move into a profitable zone. The profit potential for the strategy is
                        technically unlimited to the downside.</p>

                        <li><strong>Cash Secured Puts:</strong></li>
                     <p><img src="img/12.webp"/></p>

                     <p>That can be used as a way of purchasing a particular stock at a
                        discount. It only works if your account has enough money to actually
                        buy the stock because you will be obliged to do so if the option is
                        exercised. If it isn’t, you’ve made some money because it will expire
                        without forcing you to buy but you’ll still bank the premium in the
                        process. Either way, assuming you really do want that stock, you win.
                        In that strategy, you’ll set the strike price at the exact price you’re
                        looking to obtain that stock for. The only downside is that it could
                        drop a lot lower and at that point you really won’t feel like you got
                        the best bargain. Out of the money puts have a better chance of
                        expiring without being exercised. If you’re only looking to make
                        profit on the premium or you’re not desperate to own the underlying
                        stock, that can often be your best bet. If you do end up owning the
                        stock, your usual hope is that it will change direction and you can
                        trade it to make another profit.</p>
        <li>Married Puts: To do that, purchase stock and a put at the same
    time. That provides an insurance for you and a “floor” to protect
    you if that stock suddenly plunges. It will make sure you don’t
    lose the clothes on your back if the stock does plummet but it
    also has the chance to make a little money if your timing is good
    and the stock price rises.</li>

    <li>Rolling Your Positions: We covered that briefly but, just as a
        reminder, rolling your position can help you increase your profit
        over time. When you do that, you simply set up a new call as
        soon as the old one expires in the hope that the stock will
        continue to move in the same direction it has been doing until
        now. You will be looking to go up in strike price and out in time
        to an expiration date. It can be risky because there is no
        guarantee that the stock will continue to do what it has been
        doing, so, it’s only worth taking the risk if you think there is a
        reasonable chance the stock will continue to move in the same
        direction. If you roll a put, on the other hand, you’re going down
        in strike price and out in time to deadline because you want to
        avoid actually selling the stock. For both those alternatives,
        you’ll be entering a buy to close order and initiating a new
        contract.</li>
