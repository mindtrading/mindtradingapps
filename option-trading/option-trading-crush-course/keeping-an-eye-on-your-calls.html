<h3>Keeping an Eye on Your Calls</h3>
<p>Once you’ve purchased a call contract, your job is not over. In fact, it has
    only just begun. From now until the expiration date, you need to keep an
    eye on what your stock is doing to see whether it goes up, down, or
    nowhere at all.</p>

    <li><strong>Down:</strong> If the stock unexpectedly begins to move down, it’s
        moving further and further away from the strike price. If that
        trend continues, it’s going to mean that you can’t exercise your
        right to buy at the expiration date and you’ve lost out. You could
        choose to try to sell your option to regain some of that potential
        loss if there’s still time value enough to justify someone taking it
        off your hands. If you choose to keep it, remember that you don’t
        actually have to buy the stock. You are only going to lose the
        premium on the expiration date.</li><br>

        <li><strong>No Movement:</strong> The stock is hovering around the strike price
            and is losing time value as it does. Again, you may want to think
            about selling the call option to reap back some of the premium.
            However, if you think there’s a chance that things will change
            before the expiration date and the stock will start moving up,
            that’s not always a good idea. It’s a tough call to make because
            you could end up losing out on a tidy profit if you don’t give the
            stock breathing room to start moving. Again, remember you’ll
            only lose the premium if it doesn’t reach the strike price or you
            decide not to buy.</li><br>

    <li><strong>Up:</strong> Here’s where options traders have a habit of getting antsy.
        You’re watching the stock rise and it’s gone far beyond the strike
        price. Naturally, you want to call in the contract right away and
        you hit the “sell to close” button so you can sell it and bank that
        profit. If the stock has indeed reached the top of its curve and is
        about to start dropping again, that can indeed be the right call.
        However, you also have the option to “roll up” your call by
        closing out your position and moving it to one with a higher
        strike price. You can also “roll over” to a strike price with a later
        expiration. There is a third option which is to actually exercise
        the right to buy that you purchased in the first place.</li>
