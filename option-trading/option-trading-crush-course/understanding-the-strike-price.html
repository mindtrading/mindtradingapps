    <h3>Understanding the Strike Price</h3>
    <p>We previously touched on the idea of the strike price, but it’s such a fundamental aspect of options trading that it bears looking at in greater detail.</p>
    <p>To review, the strike price is the fixed price at which the underlying stock can either be bought or sold. When you purchase a call option, what you are purchasing is the right to buy a stock at a certain price. Selling a call option means that you are selling your buyer the right to purchase a stock at a certain price.</p>
    <p>The strike price is an aspect of every options trade and you will want to hone in on that every time. It’s that important. Never forget that, if the underlying stock never reaches the strike price, the trade is worthless because the option will simply expire on the expiration date.</p>
    <p>The difference between the current market price of the stock and the strike price of the option also represents the profit-per-share you can expect to make if you are successful.</p>
    <p>Let’s say, for example, that you find two trades for a stock that is currently worth $150. One has a strike price of $125 and the other has a strike price of $100.</p>
    <p>In the first trade, the stock price will need to drop to $125 before you have the right to buy it or sell it (depending on whether the option is a call or a buy). In the second, it will need to drop to $100 before you have that right.</p>
    <p>The value of the option is simple to calculate. It’s the difference between the strike price and the current price of the stock. In the first of these examples, the trade has a potential worth of $25; in the second, the potential worth is $50.</p>
    <p>At first glance, that would seem to mean that the second option is the one to go for because its value is so much higher. However, you also need to bear in mind that you cannot dictate what the market does.</p>
    <p>That is where risk comes in. How confident are you, in this example, that the stock will plummet $50 before the expiration date of the option? If you’re as certain as it’s possible to be, it’s a great investment. If you’re not, you stand to lose the premium you paid for the option because it will never reach the price at which you have the right to realize the trade.</p>
    <p>The trade that has a strike price of $125 is, therefore, a surer bet because it’s always going to be more likely that a stock will rise or fall by the smaller amount than the larger one. The trade-off, as you can see, is that you won’t make nearly the profit you would on the riskier option, so, you have to ask yourself whether the premium you’d be paying is worthwhile.</p>
