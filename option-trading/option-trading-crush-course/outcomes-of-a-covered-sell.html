<h3>Outcomes of a Covered Sell</h3>

     <P> As we’re using the idea of selling covered calls as a trade example to help
        you learn the basics of options trading overall, let’s now take a close look at
        what is going to happen to your option once you’ve listed it.
        <ol>
            <li>The stock increases in value: If the stock moves up and hits
                your strike price, that means that your buyer can now exercise
                their right and buy the shares. The more the stock rises, the more
                likely it is that the buyer will do exactly that. When your goal is
                to sell shares, that is what you want to happen. You will pocket
                the premium as well as the difference between the shares as they
                were valued when you listed them, and the value they are at on
                the expiration date. In other words, you will have capital gains in
                addition to the premium you received.</li>
                <li>The stock value doesn’t move: If the shares don’t change either
                    up or down during the time the option is open, then they won’t
                    hit the strike price and you won’t have to sell. You will pocket
                    the premium and can factor that into your overall profits when
                    you relist the stock. Many options traders actually count on that
                    outcome. It’s the one they are hoping for because it means they
                    make a profit AND keep the shares. Feel free to follow the same
                    logic but make sure your entire plan doesn’t hinge on it. You
                    don’t control the market, so, you could find yourself with a nasty
                    surprise.</li>

                    <li>The stock drops in value: If that happens, the outcome is very
                        similar to the share price not moving at all. The difference is that
                        you are losing money on the shares themselves all the time they
                        are dropping. They might bounce back but, if they don’t, then
                        the expiration date will arrive and you’ll be holding shares that
                        are now worth a lot less than they used to be and that constitutes
                        a loss in value. If, while monitoring your option contracts, you
                        see that a stock is starting to drop, you need to prepare to take
                        emergency action. Do that by calculating your “breakeven”
                        price. Subtract the premium per share from the price of the share
                        at the time you listed it. For example, if the share was worth $50
                        and the premium per share is $1.50, your breakeven price per
                        share is $48.50. If it falls below that price, you can buy back
                        your option. That is not something you should rely on or do
                        often but it is good as an emergency action. To do that, go back
                        to the order entry and select “Buy to Close.” Enter either the
                        current ask price or something lower, depending how risky you
                        want to be. Once the trade goes through, you are back in control
                        of your shares and can either keep or sell them as you deem fit.</li>
        </ol>
        
<p>As an aside, you should know that buying back your options is actually a
    deliberate strategy used by some people who trade in covered calls. Doing
    so allows you to manage your own risk and to end trades that are likely to
    be disadvantageous for you so that you can list those stocks again at a later
    date.<br><br>

    For instance, let’s say that your underlying stock is rising fast and you think
    you’re going to lose out on a lot of potential profit as it continues to
    skyrocket. You could “roll up” your options by buying back your call at the
    current ask price or lower and then selling it again at a higher strike price.
    Simply setting your stock to sell is enough to garner you a regular income
    with your options trading but there are other ways you can make the most
    of the market.<br><br>

    A typical strategy for a person who deals in selling covered calls is to
    purchase a stock and sell a covered call on that stock at the exact same time.
    It’s called a “Buy-Write Strategy.” Your brokerage firm will almost
    certainly allow you to do that and may even have it listed on their online
    order screen for you to select.
    </p>
        <p>So what would you be looking for if you did that?
        </p>
        
<li>A stock that you would be happy to have in your share portfolio,
    assuming that the buyer never realized their right to purchase it.</li>
    <li>A stock that is showing a premium rate in the marketplace you
        would be happy to accept.</li>
     <li>   A stock that is predictable in that it is rising or dipping in worth
        slowly over time.
        </li>


        <p>Keep your eyes firmly on the stock market over time and you will start to
            see those trends. You’ll also develop an eye for spotting good trades—the
            ones where you can make a quick profit by selling a few contracts at a good
            premium price.<br><br>
            A second advanced strategy is to use options trading to get rid of stocks you
            don’t want to own any more. Maybe, for instance, they’ve been flat for a
            long time and you aren’t seeing enough movement to make them
            worthwhile. You can set up a sell that would return a good premium while
            allowing you to get rid of your stock at close to its current price. Instead of
            simply unloading them, you’d walk away with a premium and a potentially
            tidy profit.<br><br>
            Third, you can choose to use the “half and half” strategy. Keep some of
            your shares in a particular company and sell the rest. That works well if you
            aren’t really sure whether you should sell them all but make sure you are
            keeping records of what you have done.</p>
