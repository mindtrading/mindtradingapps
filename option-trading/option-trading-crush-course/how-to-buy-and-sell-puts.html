   <h3> How to Buy and Sell Puts</h3>

   <p>Buying puts can be a winning strategy if done right. The stock market
    wouldn’t be the stock market if it only moved in one direction. By buying
    puts as well as calls, you’re making the most of the market by profiting no
    matter which direction it’s heading. Puts are your ally during a bear market.<br><br>

    Buying a put means that you are going to make a profit with a stock
    declining in price. Just as you’re looking for a stock to skyrocket in a call,
    you’re looking for one that will plunge in a put. The strategy is, therefore,
    very similar and it’s just that you’re looking in the opposite direction.<br><br>

    Most traders buy puts either because they’re speculating on a stock and
    think they can make a profit in the short term as that stock plummets, or
    because the puts can function as insurance for your overall portfolio. If you
    actually own a stock in question, you can buy puts on it if you believe it’s at
    risk of heading downward.<br><br>

    For instance, let’s say you own stock in a company and you think the share
    price will drop because of the business environment. You aren’t sure, but
    you can make an educated guess. Simply leaving that stock sitting in your
    portfolio means potentially watching as its value bleeds away.<br><br>

    On the other hand, you could buy a put and give yourself the option to
    offload that stock if it does drop to a certain value. As the buyer, you are not
    obligated to sell your stock when the deadline arrives. You’re just giving
    yourself the option to do so. Of course, as always, you’ll lose the premium.<br><br>

    The biggest difference between buying calls and puts is that the stock
    market has a habit of falling much faster than it rises. A stock can drop
    through the floor in just a single day whereas it can take weeks or months to
    climb to magical figures.<br><br>

    To buy puts for the sake of speculation, you’ll need to master the art of
    spotting weaker stocks—the ones that are likely to fall. That is easiest
    during a bear market and when the overall economic outlook is poor.
    Even the most successful companies have down times and, if you own a put
    contract when that happens, you stand to make money.<br><br>

    When buying a put, you’ll need to think in reverse. The lower the strike
    price, the cheaper the option will be. In other words, it is the opposite of
    buying a call. You should also factor in the speed of the market when
    looking at expiration dates. If you think the stock is going to drop hard and
    fast, you probably want a shorter deadline. If you think it will take a while
    for the full effects of the drop to realize, then you will want a longer one.
    The most successful put strategies, at least at first, will probably be slightly
    in the money because you can profit from a smaller change in the
    underlying value. Conversely, you’ll make more money on a smaller
    premium with an out of the money put but you have less chance of actually
    making that money.<br><br>

    Selling puts can be a gamble. The idea behind it is that, by selling your
    promise to buy stocks, you are earning a steady premium but you’re
    choosing contracts that you believe will never hit the strike price. That way,
    you walk away having been paid for the contract without having to actually
    own the underlying stock.<br><br>

    It’s also a way to increase your stock portfolio and get paid for doing so.
    That can be useful if you think a stock’s dropping price is temporary and
    you want to snap up a few of them before they start to rise again and you
    can sell them.<br><br>
    
    Be aware, of course, that when selling a put you are obligating yourself to
    buy that stock if it does reach the strike price, so, it’s a bad gamble if you
    lack the funds to do that when the expiration date arrives.</p>
