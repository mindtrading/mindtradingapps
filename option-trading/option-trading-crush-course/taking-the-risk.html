   <strong> Taking the Risk</strong>
 <p>   For the novice, options trading is a daunting concept. Packed with jargon
    and seeming to need a degree in math to figure it all out, the very idea of
    learning the basics has put off countless curious traders.</p>

    <p>  I’ve written this book to bridge the gap, taking you from thoroughly
    confused to fully aware of what options trading entails. It’s aimed either at
    complete beginners who have no idea where to get started or at readers who
    have dipped their toes in the waters and found themselves floundering.</p>


    <p> The book is also aimed at readers who think that options trading is far more
    risky than its siblings—stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. If you think those
    are the safer way to go and you’ve avoided options trading until now, I’m
    here to show you that options are just as fruitful a direction, if not more.</p>


    <p>  Much as with any other skill in life, options trading gets easier over time.
    Once you’ve mastered the basics and are fluent in the language, you’ll find
    that it becomes less and less difficult to decipher the possibilities in front of
    you and pick the best one. In fact, eventually it becomes like learning to use
    a tool or ride a bike—you know it so well that you barely need to think
    about what you’re doing.</p>


    <p>  So, put your feet up, grab a coffee, and prepare to start the process of
    understanding. Trust me when I tell you that it’s not nearly so daunting as
    you might have thought.</p>
