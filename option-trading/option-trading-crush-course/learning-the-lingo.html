  <h3>  Learning the Lingo</h3>
   <p>Options traders speak their own language. It’s not meant to confuse you, it’s
    just the natural process of creating a shorthand by which one trader can
    converse with another more easily and thoroughly.<br><br>
    Of course, it does make it difficult to plunge into the waters of options
    trading if you can’t speak the language. It is a lot like trying to decipher
    road signs in a foreign country. It makes it hard to know the right direction
    —or even where you’re standing right now.<br><br>
    We’re going to take a look at the common terms you’ll be dealing with as
    you enter the world of options trading before we begin taking a deeper look
    at your strategies.<br><br>
    Don’t worry about trying to learn the terms by rote. They will all become
    clear as you forge onward. This glossary will always be available to you so
    that you can check on a meaning if you need to.
</p> 
<ol type="A">
    <li><strong>Strike Price:</strong> A price per share agreed upon before an option is
        traded. At that price, stock may be bought or sold under the
        terms of your option contract. This price is also known as the
        “exercise price.”</li>
        <li><strong>Bid/Ask:</strong> The latest price that a market maker has offered for an
        option is its “ask” price. In other words, it’s what the seller is
        willing to accept for the trade. The latest amount that a buyer has
        offered for an option is the “bid” price.</li>
       <li> <strong>Premium:</strong> The premium is a per-share amount paid to the seller
        in order to procure an option. The seller will keep that premium
        whether or not the buyer exercises their right to buy or sell the
        stock at the deadline.</li> 
       <li><strong>In-the-Money:</strong> Often shortened to ITM, that means that the
        stock price is above the strike price for a call or below the strike
        price for a put. In other words, it is now at the right price to be
        traded.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Out-of-the-Money:</strong> Often shortened to OTM, that means the
            current price is below the strike price for a call or above it for a
            put. Such an option is priced according to “time value.”
            At-the-Money: The strike price is equal to the current stock
            price.</li> 
           <li><strong>Long:</strong> In this context, “long” is used to imply ownership. Once
            you purchase a stock or option, you are “long” that item in your
            account.</li>
           <li><strong> Short:</strong> If you sell an option or stock that you do not actually
            own, you are “short” that security in your account.
            Exercise: The owner of the option takes advantage of the right
            to buy or sell what they purchased with the option by
            “exercising” it.</li>
           <li><strong>Assigned: </strong> When an owner of an option exercises it, the seller is
            “assigned” and must make good on the trade. In other words, the
            seller must fulfill their obligation to buy or sell.
            Intrinsic Value/Time Value: The intrinsic value of an option
            refers to how much it is ITM. Most options also include time
            value and that refers to how long is left until the option expires.
            That time has value because during that time the stock can still
            change in price. An OTM option has no intrinsic value because
            it’s a loss but it does have time value because that loss might
            change.</li>
            <li><strong>Time Decay:</strong> Linked to time value, that term refers to the fact
            that, as time ticks on, the amount of time value slowly decreases.
            At the expiration date of an option contract, the contract has NO
            time value and is worth only its intrinsic value.</li>
            <li><strong>Index Options/Equity Options:</strong> Index options are settled by
                cash whereas equity options involve trading stock. The main
                difference between those two types of options is that an index
                option usually cannot be exercised before the expiration date
                while an equity option usually can.</li> 
               <li><strong></strong>Stop-Loss Order:</strong> That is an order to sell either an option or a
                stock when it reaches a particular price. Its purpose is to set a
                point at which you, as the trader, would like to get out of your
                position. At that price, your stop order is activated as a market
                order. In other words, a market order looks for the best available
                price at that moment in order to close out your position.</li>
</ol>
<p>Those are the most common terms you will hear used as you venture into
    the world of options trading. It’s worth mentioning that, as you extend your
    understanding, you’ll encounter more terms. However, the above terms are
    enough in order to help you understand your first trades.</p>
