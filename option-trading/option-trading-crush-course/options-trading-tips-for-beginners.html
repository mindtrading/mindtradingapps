    <h3>Options Trading Tips for Beginners</h3>

    <li>Always have a trade plan: I’m sure you have heard that before.
        When trading options, it is critical to control your emotions.
        Always have a plan to work and always work your plan. No
        matter what your emotions are telling you to do, don’t deviate
        from your plan. A basic trading plan should consist of but not be
        limited to: <ol>
            <li>How much you are willing to risk per trade?</li>
               <li> How will you find opportunities in the market place?</li> 
              <li>When you will enter the trade?</li> 
              <li>What is your exit strategy?</li>
                Trading with a plan helps you establish more successful patterns
                of trading and keeps your worries in check.</ol></li>
<li>Trade Liquid Options: When you get a quote for any option in
    the marketplace, you’ll notice a difference between the bid price
    (how much someone is willing to pay for an option) and the ask
    price (how much someone is willing to sell an option for). That
    is known as the spread. Oftentimes, the bid price and the ask
    price do not reflect what the option is really worth. The real
    value of the option will actually be somewhere near the middle
    of the bid and ask. Liquidity in the market means there are active
    buyers and sellers at all times with heavy competition to fill
    transactions. The most liquid options will have a penny
    difference on some contracts. The average daily volume of a
    contract and its open interest can also be indicators of liquidity.
    If you are consistently trading illiquid contracts with wider
    spreads, you are incurring significant slippage. Keep in mind that
    in the more liquid situations, where there is decent volume and a
    narrow spread, there is a chance that you can buy an option at
    the bid or sell at its ask. Over time, that can give you an
    advantage.
    </li>
    <li>Diversify your portfolio: That means diversifying strategies to
        ensure you have exposure to the unknowns and different market
        environments. For example, strategies such as straddles allow
        one to profit from explosive moves in either direction, while bull
        spreads and other premium selling strategies allow one to profit
        in calm, directionless environments. Even if option buying is
        your only strategy, diversity within an options portfolio implies
        exposure to both calls and puts, different time frames with
        respect to time played until expiration, and more than one set up
        for both call and put trades. Don’t put all your eggs in a single
        basket.
        </li>
        <li>Discipline yourself: It is not easy to follow a set of rules
            consistently unless you are a robot. But habit can be created out
            of consistent processes. Have the discipline to follow your
            trading plan for profitable trades. Don’t ignore money
            management principles. Learn from your trades that result in
            losses. Don’t be too greedy and don’t be too fearful. Learn to
            balance your emotions.</li>
