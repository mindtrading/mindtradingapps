   <h3> Why Options Rather than Stocks?</h3>
  <p> One very good question that newcomers often ask is why a trader would
    want to trade in options rather than stocks. What’s the difference? Is one
    better than the other?<br><br>
    It’s true that the stock market is less complicated to work with. All you
    really need to worry about in the case of the stock market is the direction
    things are heading. Down is bad for your shares but could be good for
    buying. Up is good for your shares and could be good for selling.<br><br>
    With stock trading, you are also seldom going to lose 100 percent of your
    investment if things go sideways. If you pick a stock thinking it will climb
    but instead it plummets, you can sell quickly and lose only the difference
    between your initial investment and the price of that stock as you sell.
    Not so with options trading, where you will lose the lot if you make a bad
    judgment call. Stock trading can be a great introduction to the market but it
    is not as flexible and it is less likely to win big compared to an options
    trade.<br><br>
    When you enter the options trading market, you quickly find out that you
    actually have three things to worry about—and what those things are doing
    is not so simple as “down is bad, up is good.” You are interested in the
    direction stocks are heading but you can make big money on a downward
    direction as easily as upward if you make the right call. Meanwhile, you are
    also concerned about your timing and the magnitude of the trade.<br><br>

    In a nutshell, the biggest reason to choose options over stocks is that it
    provides you with flexibility within your own portfolio and allows you to
    play the market at its own game whether you are a bull or a bear.<br><br>
    
    So let’s take a closer look at options trading and its benefits, shall we?
