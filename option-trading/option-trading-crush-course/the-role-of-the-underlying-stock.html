    <h3>The Role of the Underlying Stock</h3>
    <p>It’s vital to understand that stocks do play a fundamental role in options trading—even though they may not be what you are buying and selling. Bear in mind that an option is only a piece of paper that gives you the right to buy or sell a stock. Without the stock, you would have nothing to buy or sell.</p>
    <p>You might say that the stock is Oz behind the curtain, changing and moving while your attention is fixed elsewhere. Letting Oz get up to his tricks without you is a bad idea. You need to be keeping an eye on your stocks just as much as you follow the options themselves.</p>
    <p>Not every stock is allowed to have its options traded on an options exchange. In total, you’ll find somewhere in the region of 3,600 stocks spread across twelve different exchanges, although that number changes all the time.</p>
    <p>What does that mean? Well, the exchanges have in place some very solid rules that dictate which stocks may and may not participate in options trading. You’ll find some of the biggest business names on the planet have options, and you’ll also find what are known as “penny stocks” which buy and sell for less than $3.</p>
    <p>In general, penny stocks won’t do you much good for options trading. There simply isn’t enough liquidity in such a small price for you to bother with the effort required to trade them.</p>
    <p>Instead, I would recommend sticking with the big names—the recognizable companies such as Microsoft, Apple, Google, and McDonalds.</p>
    <p>Another point to bear in mind is that there is a fixed relationship between options trading and the underlying stock. One option contract will always be equal to 100 stock shares.</p>
    <p>In other words, a single contract will give you the right to buy or sell 100 shares of a stock. Multiply the number of contracts involved in a trade by 100 and you’ll know how many shares are involved.</p>
 
    <p>A third factor of that relationship between an option and its underlying stock is that whenever the stock goes up or down, in most cases so, too, will the option contract.</p>
    <p>Because a stock and its options are so inextricably linked, you will need to study the stock market in detail to be a whiz at options trading. You will need to be able to predict which stocks are going to head in which direction and when—only if you get that right will your trading be truly successful.</p>

    <p>For that reason, a lot of options traders started with the stock market, itself, and gave themselves the experience of the market’s whims before taking a step up to the next level. If you haven’t done that, it will be worth spending a month or more trading on the stock market. Even a theoretical portfolio that you manage and never pay a penny to invest in is a helpful step.</p>
    <p>Doing that will allow you to get a sense of how the market functions overall and it will familiarize you with some of the stocks you might be interested in for trading with options. The best options traders have almost a sixth sense of how an underlying stock is going to perform. The only way to develop that uncanny ability is through exposure, research, and experience.</p>
