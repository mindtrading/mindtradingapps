    <h3>Understanding the Greeks</h3>
<p>Now that you know the basics of options trading, you’re no doubt raring to
    get started with your first trades. All that remains is to introduce you to
    some of the strategies you now have open to you.</p>
   <p> First up is the Greeks. You’re going to see of those all over the place and
    they can really help you understand your chances with a particular trade, so,
    it’s important to understand what they are.

    <li>Delta: Beginner options traders sometimes think when a stock 
        moves by $1 that the price of the options based on the stock will 
        also move $1. That’s not always the case.
        Delta stands for the change in price of the option when compared 
        to the change in price of the underlying stock. For call options, it 
        will be between 0 and 1; for put options, it will be between 0 and 
        -1. The closer to 1 or -1, the more likely that the price of that 
        option will increase or decrease dollar for dollar as the stock
        price changes. If it’s at 0.5 or -0.5, it will increase or decrease by
        50 cents for every dollar of change on the stock. The further in
        the money the option is, the higher its delta will be. The higher
        the delta, the more likely your option is going to finish in the
        money.<br>
        For example, if you own a call option on stock ABC with a
        strike price of $60 and there are sixty days before expiration, the
        stock is exactly $60. Since it is an at-the-money option, the delta
        should be about .50. Let’s say the option is worth $5. So, in
        theory, if the stock goes up to $61, then the option price should
        go up from $5 to $5.50. If the stock continues to move higher,
        delta will continue to rise.<br>
        What if the stock drops to $59 from $60? The options price will
        drop to $1.50 from $2 and again reflecting the .50 delta of at-themoney options ($2–$1.50). If the stock keeps going down,
        however, delta will continue to go down.
        </li>
        <li>Gamma: That stands for the change in the delta of an option
            relative to the change in the price of the underlying stock. It tells
            you, therefore, what the rate of increase of the delta is. As a
            buyer, a high gamma is good assuming that your assumptions
            about what the underlying stock is going to do are correct. If
            you’re wrong, it can be very bad indeed because your mistake is
            going to work against you more quickly.</li>
            <li>Theta: That stands for the change in the price of an option
                relative to how much time is left until it expires. It is directly
                related to the time value and will decrease as that value does.
                You want a low theta risk with options more than 90 days before
                expiration if you are long on your position because you don’t
                want the time value to drop. You want a high theta if you are
                short with options less than 30 days to deadline.</li>
                
                <li>Vega: That stands for the change in price relative to the option’s
                    change in volatility. Premiums increase with volatility so vega
                    will, too. Specifically, it will tell you how every 1 percent point
                    change in the implied volatility affects the premium. If the
                    volatility drops or disappears altogether, it’s possible that your
                    option could lose value, so, vega is important to keep an eye on</li>
