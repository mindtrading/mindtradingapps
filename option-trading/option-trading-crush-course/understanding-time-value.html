<h3>Understanding Time Value</h3>

<p>At this stage, let’s take a deeper look at one of the factors influencing the
    price of the options you are considering. Time value, as we’ve mentioned
    before, is what’s left after you take the intrinsic value away from the
    premium.<br><br>


    In other words, if your option is priced at $2 and the intrinsic value is $1.50
    —the premium minus the stock price will give the time value of $0.50. The
    time value will slowly bleed away as you get closer to the expiration date.<br><br>

    Time value is your friend as a buyer but, as a seller, it’s quite the opposite.
    You are on a timer from the moment you buy a call because, the closer you
    are to the expiration date, the less time there is left for the underlying stock
    to do what you want it to do and for your option to increase in its value.<br><br>

    The closer you get to the deadline, the faster the time value will trickle
    away. Be very aware of the time value, because it’s far more important than
    a lot of beginners realize. That is why you will want to factor it in very
    carefully to any decision you make.<br><br>

    Too far out and your contract could start moving in the opposite direction
    again and the premium will be dauntingly high. Too close and you simply
    won’t have enough time to watch your stocks head for the magic value you
    were hoping for, leaving you out of pocket on the premium.<br><br>

    Aim for two to three months, plenty of time for your strategy to see fruition
    without risking it heading in the opposite direction or paying a fortune in
    premiums.</p>
