    <h3>Getting Started with Covered Calls in Options Trading</h3>
    <p>As beginners, most people choose to dip their toes in the complicated waters of options trading by selling covered calls. It’s arguably the most basic level of options trading and, while also not the most adrenaline-inducing, it is a great way to find your feet before moving on to more complicated strategies.</p>
    <p>Selling covered calls is also likely to be an aspect of your options portfolio in the long-term. Many traders use it as a steady way of generating income and it is a conservative baseline for their account.</p>
    <p>A third benefit to starting with covered calls is that it includes the majority of the knowledge and strategies that you will use as an options trader, so, it’s a perfect training ground.</p>
    <p>Using that strategy, you are going to be selling the right to buy underlying stocks that you own. A “covered” call is when you own the shares and, therefore, you have the sale covered.</p>
    <p>Before you can begin, therefore, you will need to own at least 100 shares of a stock. By writing an option on those shares, you are offering buyers the right to buy them by the expiration date if the share price hits your strike price.</p>
    <p>When a buyer takes advantage of your offer, you will receive a premium. That’s yours to take home. You will never have to give it back whether the strike price is met or not and the buyer exercises their right or not. That, right there, is your reason for selling covered calls—the steady influx of cash from the premiums.</p>
    <p>Covered calls are also a good way to sell your stock. A clever trader will use that strategy to clear their portfolio of shares they no longer want to own. There is an advantage to owning a stock in the interim, too, because you may receive a dividend. You’ll receive capital gains (the difference between the price now and the increased price at time of sale) if the stock meets your strike price when the expiration date arrives.</p>
    <p>One final advantage of covered calls is that the strategy can be used in a tax-deferred account or an IRA. You won’t be taxed on the revenue from your trade until you take out money at the time of your retirement. There are caveats to that rule, of course, so you may want to book an appointment with your accountant to make sure it works for you.</p>
    <p>The downside? There is always the danger that your shares skyrocket before the deadline is up and you are forced to sell them to your buyer anyway, which means you’re losing out on a potential big win. That’s the gamble and the truth is that even that risk will even out in the end because you’ll be making money on the premiums for those trades that didn’t turn out to be a bad idea.</p>
    <p>When the expiration date arrives, you will EITHER have the premium in your pocket and no shares or you will have both the premium and the shares because the buyer didn’t choose to purchase them after all. Either way, you’re always walking away with something.</p>
  
    <p>Let’s dive into the process of selling a covered call, examining every aspect step by step.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Choose a stock that’s in your portfolio and has been performing well. Ensure it's one you're willing to part with if exercised.</li>
        <li>Access your online account and enter the stock's symbol to view its option chain, focusing on calls you can sell.</li>
        <li>Review the premiums listed under the “bid price” column to understand your potential profit per share.</li>
        <li>Select options expiring in two to three months to balance premium size and timing.</li>
        <li>Compare “bid” and “ask” prices to decide whether to sell immediately or set a higher ask for potentially greater returns.</li>
        <li>Identify options “in the money” and understand what that means for immediate exercise profitability.</li>
        <li>Look for a covered call with a strike price slightly “out of the money” to aim for profit both from the sale and the premium.</li>
        <li>Consider “in the money” contracts if the premium offsets potential sale losses, focusing on overall profit.</li>
        <li>Choose the contract that suits your needs and wait to see if the buyer exercises their right by the expiration date.</li>
        <li>For selling a call, select “Sell to Open” and specify the number of contracts, with each contract representing 100 shares.</li>
        <li>Decide between a market order and a limit order, with the latter usually offering more control over the selling price.</li>
        <li>Set the duration your option will be available in the marketplace, opting for “day” to adjust strategy if necessary.</li>
        <li>Determine your bid price under “Limit Price”, disregarding last sale data as it may be outdated.</li>
        <li>Submit your order, placing your first covered sell in the market and awaiting a buyer.</li>
    </ol>
