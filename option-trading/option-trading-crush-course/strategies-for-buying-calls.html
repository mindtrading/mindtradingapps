<h3>Strategies for Buying Calls</h3>
<p>I have urged you several times throughout this book to start paying attention
    to the stock market and learn how to spot trends in the ups and downs of
    particular shares. As you become increasingly familiar with that part of
    your options trading experience, you can also make use of a column in the
    trading screen itself to guide you.<br><br>

    That column is titled “Open Interest” and it represents the total amount of
    open contracts on a particular underlying stock that are still running at the
    time you are viewing the page.<br><br>

    What you are looking at is the supply and demand on the stock. The more
    open interest there is on a particular contract, the more people believe it’s a
    sure bet. You can also watch for sudden changes. If a call contract has 500
    in that column one day and 2000 the next, it means that a significant
    number of traders believe that stock is going to move in that price direction.
    Those people aren’t necessarily right, so, it’s up to you to use your
    judgment. Nevertheless, it can be a very helpful addition to your tool kit
    when it comes to predicting the movement of the stock market and making
    the right decisions in your own trading.<br><br>

    At the same time, there are a number of factors that should be guiding you
    as you choose the right contract. The following factors can help you:</p>
    <li><strong>In or Out of the Money: </strong>As a call seller, you were mostly
        interested in the premium. As a buyer, you want a bargain.
        You’ll find that the premium is cheaper the more out of the
        money a contract is. In other words, the further the stock needs
        to climb before you can call in your option, the cheaper the
        premium will be. That doesn’t mean it’s the best bet. If you don’t
        believe the stock will climb that high, it doesn’t matter how
        cheap the premium is as you’re not going to be able to purchase
        that stock. Calls that are slightly in the money are a good option
        for beginners and more likely to bring you a modest or
        sometimes larger profit. 
        </li>
        <li><strong>Stock Movement:</strong> There is absolutely no point buying a bargain
            call that has a strike price higher than you believe it will go. If it
            never reaches that price, you’ve lost the premium you paid.
            Sometimes it can be worth the risk if you are reasonably sure the
            stock has a chance of rising that high but that doesn’t happen
            very often.</li>
            <li><strong> Time Value:</strong> If you’re purchasing a contract that would require
                the stock to rise above a price, it stands to reason that you need
                to give it enough time to do that. Premiums also are lower on
                short term contracts but that’s because there’s probably not
                enough time for the stock to reach its target. Be circumspect
                when looking for contracts with cheap premiums. The lowest
                price is often not the best one. It’s important to give your
                strategy breathing room, so, lean toward the calls with long
                enough expiration dates to allow the stock to do what you hope it
                will.</li>
        <li><strong>Spread:</strong> This is the difference between the bid and ask price and
            it has a direct impact on the price you will pay. A fair price
            usually falls somewhere between the two. The higher you pay,
            the more you are taking from your profit. Bear in mind that you
            will usually begin at a loss in your trade. If you pay $1.50 when
            the bid price is $1, that’s a $0.50 loss on each share. Because the
            whole idea is that the stock will rise in value, that’s not
            necessarily a big issue although it can be. As a general rule, if
            there is a wide spread, you should aim for somewhere in the
            middle. If it’s narrow, you can probably pay the ask price
            without too much concern.</li>


            <p>To make a profit buying covered calls, you have to be right on all of these
                fronts. You need to choose the right time, the right direction, and the right
                contract price if you’re going to be successful. If you get one of those things
                wrong, you will likely lose that profit. Be aware that buying calls is where
                the risk comes in for options traders. That is why I highly recommend
                balancing your activity and relying on covered sells for your steady income
                while keeping your buying activity relatively modest.</p>
