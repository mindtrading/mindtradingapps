        <h3>Exercising Your Right to Buy the Stock</h3>
        <p>
        Bearing in mind that an option is all about the right to buy or sell a stock, it
        might seem strange that most traders are not looking to do that. Instead,
        they are looking to immediately pass the stock on as a sell and make a profit
        by taking the premium along with the increased price of the stock from
        what they paid for it.<br><br>
        That’s what you should be basing your strategy around—the idea of gaining
        stocks and instantly selling them back into the options market and making
        your profit in the process. In most cases, that’s what you will be aiming to
        do.<br><br>
        It is also worth noting that some traders who buy call options never want to
        own the underlying stock. They are only interested in making money on the
        options which they can do by buying and selling options without ever
        owning the stock.<br><br>
        Nevertheless, there are still going to be times when you want to exercise
        your right in order to purchase the underlying stock itself. Usually, that is
        when you genuinely want to add a particular stock to your portfolio. It’s up
        to you to decide when those times arrive.<br><br>
        First things first. Be very aware that you will automatically exercise your
        right at the expiration date if the option is in the money unless you tell your
        broker not to take that action. That won’t happen if it’s out of the money but
        it’s still imperative that you keep a calendar of your trades so that you aren’t
        surprised by the sudden arrival of stocks in your portfolio that you’d
        completely forgotten about.<br><br>
        If and when you decide to exercise your right, you should almost always do
        it at the expiration date and not before because you’ll lose the time value if
        you exercise early. When you alert your broker to that decision, it’s also
        important to know that you cannot then change your mind—the decision is
        permanent.</p>
