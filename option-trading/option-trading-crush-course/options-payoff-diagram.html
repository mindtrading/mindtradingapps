<h3>Options Payoff Diagram</h3>
<p>Correctly Reading the Strategy P&L Charts</p>
<p> <img src="img/1.webp"/></p>
<p>Options Payoff or Profit and Loss (P&L) diagrams help us to understand
    where our options strategies will win or lose money at expiration based on
    different stock price points. They are incredibly useful aids to our
    discussion of options trading and, once you understand how they work, they
    can help you build out more complex options strategies and analyze
    possible trade adjustments. The horizontal axis indicates the market price of
    the underlying asset which changes along with market conditions, whereas
    the vertical axis represents the option payoff and the overall profit. The
    strikethrough horizontal line represents the strike price. BEP stands for the
    Break Even Price. The break-even price is the price in the underlying
    asset at which investors can choose to exercise or dispose of the contract
    without incurring a loss.</p>
