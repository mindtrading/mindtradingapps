<strong>Strategy for Selling Covered Calls</strong>
<p>We’ve covered the process but what about the strategy behind covered
    calls? In the last chapter, we looked at the absolute basics of that strategy
    but an experienced trader knows there’s always going to be more to an
    option than meets the eye.<br><br>

    There’s a whole list of considerations that you will eventually want to bear
    in mind as you expand your knowledge and develop your own personal
    strategy. Every trader has a different attitude toward what works and what
    doesn’t. There are plenty of ways to make selling a covered call work but
    you’ll probably find yourself preferring one or two strategies.<br><br>

    We’ll take a look now at those considerations in more detail in order to
    guide you as you delve into covered calls more deeply:
    </p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>The Market Environment:</strong> You are no doubt aware that traders
        of stocks are happy in a bull market and disgruntled in a bear
        market. You may also know that such traders hate a flat market
        most of all because very little is happening and there aren’t many
        big profits to be made. For you, as a seller of covered calls, the
        opposite is true. I highly recommend waiting for the market to
        temporarily flatten before embarking on a spate of covered call
        sales. That is because you’re only really interested in small
        changes to your share prices. If they are skyrocketing, you’re
        losing money on your contract. There also isn’t as much danger
        of the bottom falling out of the market with your stock prices
        plummeting at the same time which would be problematic.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Your Underlying Stock:</strong> There is nothing more important to
            your success than choosing the right stocks to invest in. I cannot
            stress strongly enough that your success will be heightened if
            you pick stocks that move up very slowly. You don’t want stocks
            that rise and fall very quickly, especially as a beginner, because
            they have a habit of making surprising moves that ruin your strategy. If they drop too far, you stand to lose a lot of money if
            you sell. If they rise too high, you lose the money you could
            have made if you’d sold them at the higher price. Traders who
            deal in risk often enjoy those stocks because they have higher
            premiums and a chance for huge profits but that goes against the
            idea of selling covered calls. You’re looking for a steady income
            that will underpin your riskier strategies elsewhere. By all
            means, go for the riskier stock elsewhere in your strategy but
            avoid it like the plague for covered calls.</li>
            <li><strong>The Premium:</strong> Always remember that the premium is your
                guaranteed profit. Whatever else happens, you’re going to walk
                away with that cash. When you factor in the cost to list the
                option and any commission you will lose to your broker, you’ll
                be able to calculate the actual profit you’ll make on a premium.
                Set yourself a minimum premium—a number that you consider
                to be enough to provide a profit you’ll be happy with on the
                assumption that it’s the only profit you make. When you move
                ahead on setting the strike price, you’ll likely adjust that base
                figure up or down based on what you think the underlying stock
                is going to do before the expiration date. Remember that the
                premium is only one component of the overall profit you will
                make. If you set a strike price that means you lose the same
                amount of cash on selling the shares as you made with the
                premium, the trade wasn’t worth doing in the first place.</li>

                <li><strong>The Expiration Date:</strong> There’s a reason that the premiums on
                    covered calls get higher when the expiration date is further out.
                    It’s because, much like the weather forecasts we all deride on a
                    daily basis, it gets harder and harder to predict what’s going to
                    happen to a share price the further out you go. Also, bear in mind
                    that your money is going to be tied up until the expiration date,
                    so, the premium will increase as a nod to that sacrifice. Most
                    investors believe that a time span of between a month and three
                    months works best.</li>
                   
                    
</ol>

            <p>This graph indicates profit and
            loss at expiration in respect to the stock value when sold.<br><br>
            
            As a general rule of thumb, you may wish to consider running that strategy
            approximately thirty to forty-five days from expiration to take advantage of
            accelerating time decay as expiration approaches. Of course, that depends
            on the underlying stock and market conditions such as implied volatility. <br><br>
            
            You may wish to consider selling the call with a premium that represents at
            least 2 percent of the current stock price (premium ÷ stock price).
            Ultimately, however, it’s up to you what premium will make running the
            strategy worth your while.<br><br>
            
            Beware of receiving too much time value. If the premium seems
            abnormally high, there’s usually a reason for it. Check for news in the
            marketplace that may affect the price of the stock. Remember, if something
            seems too good to be true, it usually is.<br><br>
            
            With all of those factors in mind, you are likely starting to see that there is
            no single “correct decision” when it comes to selling covered calls. It’s
            going to take practice and concentration to figure out which ones work best
            for you.<br><br>
            
            It’s also important to note that your strategy is probably going to change as
            you gain experience. The more options you sell, the more you will see new
            and more advanced ways to take advantage of the market. For now, I urge
            you to be conservative in your approach and accept that selling covered
            options is not going to win you your fortune but it is going to help you
            increase the seed money you have available to do just that.</p>
