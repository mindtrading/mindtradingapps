         <h3>MANAGING RISK IN OPTIONS TRADING</h3>
         <p>Options trading offers the potential for high returns, but with that comes a higher level of risk. The key to
            successful options trading is managing risk. In this chapter, we will discuss some strategies for managing risk
            in options trading.</p>
        <p><strong>1. SET STOP LOSS ORDERS</strong><br><br>
            A stop loss order is an order placed with a broker to sell a security when it reaches a certain price. Setting a stop loss
            order can help protect against significant losses in an options trade. For example, if an investor buys a call option for
            $2 and sets a stop loss order at $1, the option will be sold if the price falls to $1, limiting the loss to $1 per share.<br><br>
            <strong> 2. USE LIMIT ORDERS</strong><br><br>
            Limit orders are orders placed with a broker to buy or sell a security at a specific price. Using limit orders can help
            investors control the price at which they buy or sell an option. For example, an investor can set a limit order to sell a
            call option for $5. If the price of the option rises to $5, the option will be sold at that price.<br><br>
            <strong>  3. DIVERSIFY YOUR PORTFOLIO</strong><br><br>
            Diversification is a strategy that involves spreading investments across different asset classes to reduce risk. In
            options trading, diversification can involve trading options on different underlying assets or using different
            strategies. By diversifying their options trading portfolio, investors can reduce the risk of significant losses.<br><br>
            <strong> 4. TRADE WITH MONEY YOU CAN AFFORD TO LOSE</strong><br><br>
            Options trading is a high-risk activity, and investors should only trade with money they can afford to lose. Investors
            should never use money that is needed for essential expenses, such as rent or mortgage payments, to trade options.
            Instead, investors should use disposable income that they can afford to lose without causing financial hardship.<br><br>
            <strong> 5. MANAGE LEVERAGE</strong><br><br>
            Options trading involves leverage, which means that investors can control a large amount of underlying assets with a
            relatively small investment. While leverage can amplify profits, it can also increase the risk of significant losses.
            Investors should use leverage carefully and avoid taking on too much risk.<br><br>
            <strong>  6. STAY INFORMED</strong><br><br>
            Options trading is a complex and dynamic market, and investors should stay informed about market trends, news,
            and events that can impact the value of underlying assets. By staying informed, investors can make better-informed
            trading decisions and manage risk more effectively.<br><br>
            Managing risk is crucial to successful options trading. Investors should use stop loss and limit orders, diversify their
            portfolio, trade with money they can afford to lose, manage leverage carefully, and stay informed about market
            trends and events. By following these strategies, investors can reduce their risk and increase their chances of success
            in options trading.</p>
