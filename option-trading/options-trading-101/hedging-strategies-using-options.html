         <h3>HEDGING STRATEGIES USING OPTIONS</h3>
         <p>ne of the primary reasons traders use options is to hedge their positions against potential losses. Hedging is the
            practice of reducing risk by taking an offsetting position in another market. This chapter will cover some of
            the most common hedging strategies used by traders.
            </p>
           
                    <h3>1. Protective Put</h3>
                    <p>A protective put, also known as a married put, involves buying a put option for a stock already owned, acting as insurance against potential losses. If the stock price drops, the put option offsets the loss.</p>
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Investor owns 100 shares of XYZ stock at $50 per share, buys one put option with a strike price of $45 and expiration in six months.</p>
              
                    <h3>2. Covered Call</h3>
                    <p>A covered call involves selling a call option for a stock owned, receiving a premium, but capping potential profit. If the stock price rises above the call option's strike price, the investor must sell the stock.</p>
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Investor sells one call option for ABC stock at $80 strike price and expiration in three months, owning 100 shares at $75 per share.</p>
               
                    <h3>3. Collar</h3>
                    <p>A collar involves buying a put option and selling a call option for a stock owned, limiting loss and profit potential. The premium from selling the call offsets the cost of buying the put.</p>
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Investor buys one put option with a $85 strike and sells one call option with a $95 strike for DEF stock, owning 100 shares at $90 per share.</p>
               
                    <h3>4. Long Straddle</h3>
                    <p>A long straddle involves buying a call and put option for the same stock with the same strike and expiration, profiting from significant price movements.</p>
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Investor buys one call and one put option for XYZ stock with a $50 strike and one-month expiration, paying a total of $6 for the options.</p>
                
                    <h3>5. Long Strangle</h3>
                    <p>A long strangle involves buying a call and put option for the same stock with different strikes but the same expiration, profiting from significant price movements.</p>
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Investor buys one call with a $55 strike and one put with a $45 strike for XYZ stock with one-month expiration, paying a total of $8 for the options.</p>
               
                <p>Hedging strategies using options provide protection against losses but may also limit potential profits and incur costs. Traders should assess their goals and risk tolerance before implementing these strategies.</p>
