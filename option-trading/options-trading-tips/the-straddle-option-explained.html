         <h3>The Straddle Option Explained</h3>
         <p>Knowing how to use options to “straddle” a stock allows investors to profit on a stock’s general volatility. With a
            straddle in place, the investor will profit regardless of whether the stock climbs or falls in value.</p>
        <p><strong>How The Straddle Works</strong><br><br>
            To straddle a stock, the investor makes simultaneous purchases of both a call and a put option at the same strike
            price. Consider a stock, say “ABC,” that’s trading at $30 per share.<br><br>
            We’re expecting ABC to be highly volatile in the near future, so we decide to straddle the stock using its current market price as our strike price.<br><br>
            To do this, we</p>
        <p>1. Buy a call option giving us the right to purchase the stock at $30 in three months’ time<br><br>
         <strong>  AND</strong> <br><br>
            2. Buy a put option giving us the right to sell the stock for $30 per share in three months’ time</p>
        <p>Each option costs money, of course, so we’ll need the stock to move (in one direction or another) a minimum distance away from its current $30 value if we’re going to realize a profit.</p>

            <blockquote style="color: black; text-align: center; height: 160px; display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
                <div>
                    Profitability is
                    reached when the
                    stock price (at the
                    time of the option’s
                    expiration) drops
                    either well below or
                    climbs well above
                    the strike price set
                    when the option
                    was first purchased
                </div>
            </blockquote>
            </div><br><br>

            <p><strong>Stocks With Higher Volatility Ratings Have</strong><br><br>
                More Expensive Options
                As with nearly all aspects of stock trading, you’re most likely to profit if you can predict something that others fail to
                see. If it’s widely apparent that a stock is volatile, then the price of that stock’s options will go up. This will make the
                straddle strategy more expensive.<br><br>
                This is an important aspect to keep in mind before committing to a straddle option.</p>

            <p><strong>A Good Tactic For Beginner-Level Options Traders</strong> <br><br>
                When you use options to straddle a stock, your risk is limited and your potential profits are unlimited. But what if the
                stock does not change in value enough for a profit to be had? The only loss to the investor is the combined price of
                the options.<br><br>
                Here, profit is unlimited because there’s no limit to how high the stock could climb in value, and if the stock goes
                belly-up, then the put option becomes highly profitable.<br><br>
                This “cover-your-bases” approach means that no matter the outcome, investors can turn a profit. The limited risk
                aspect of the straddle makes it a good choice for beginner-level investors, especially those who are interested in
                learning how to predict and quantify stock volatility</p>
