    <h3>ARE YOU A BIGOT OR INTELLECTUAL SNOB?</h3>
    <p>
    Since using the enhanced buy & hold blueprint, I’ve beaten the market’s
    long-term performance and avoided account-crushing losses. However, I
    think it would be silly for you to ‘automatically believe me’ just because I
    said that’s what I’ve accomplished. That would be naïve.<br><br>

    I know that some trust has to be earned, so in the introduction, I asked you
    to temporarily suspend any disbelief long enough for you to try this out
    yourself. Said another way, I want you to be an action taker. I’ll provide all
    the rules and a step-by-step template, but you must see if this blueprint
    works for you.<br><br>
    However, that’s what I want. You ultimately have to decide for yourself.
    And you know what? Some don’t decide. They instead choose to be
    intellectual snobs (also called critics). They stand on the sidelines, poke
    holes in everything, and tell you all the ‘theoretical’ reasons why something
    won’t work. They are always too lazy to roll up their sleeves and put in the
    work to verify the claims of someone.</p>

    <p>Maybe critics fear failure or have been let down so often that they’re bitter.
        Who knows? All I know is that they are out there, and their onslaught of
        negativity almost discouraged me from sharing this information with you.
        I’m glad I ultimately decided to ignore them.<br><br>
        That said, here is my stern warning to intellectual snobs (aka critics). This
        book is not for you if you don’t believe you can beat the stock market over
        time. It will challenge the dogma you hold to be true, and you’ll fail with
        the blueprint because reality is manifested out of your beliefs. Now, let’s
        move on to the next group of people who will fail with these concepts,
        bigots . . </p>
        <h3>BUY & HOLD BIGOTS</h3>
        <p>I’m excited to share my market-beating blueprint with you, but I initially
            hesitated to write this book out of fear that my message would be rejected. I
            first tried to share what I had discovered with a group of buy & hold
            investors I admired. It was a massive failure. They rejected me and my
            message, and I became discouraged. Over time, I got over my feelings and
            decided this message was too important to keep to myself.<br><br>
            So, what is my message?<br>
            It’s simple; I believe you can consistently beat the stock market average.
            However, because of this message, I am always in direct conflict with a
            group of people I call buy & hold bigots. They are fanatics who tell me it is
            impossible to beat the stock market average over the long haul. Yet,
            somehow, my enhanced buy & hold portfolio has done it consistently while
            taking on less risk.<br><br>
            Pause . . .<br>
            What thoughts or emotional reactions did you have to me saying I beat the
            market? Did you automatically reject the possibility of truth in that simple
            statement? "Yeah, right . . . no way . . . sounds too good to be true.” Only
            naïve people would accept such a statement on absolute faith without
            evidence. However, a wise person, free of sickening self-limitation, would
            merely ask, "How do you beat the market, Travis? Tell me more." If that’s
            your response, this book is for you, but first . . .
            </p>
            <p>I must acknowledge the guy who inspired me to share my investing
                blueprint with the world. His name is Chris M., and I met him at a financial
                blogger conference. Chris is loosely part of a small but growing movement
                called F.I.R.E., which stands for Financial Independence, Retire Early. I
                associate with the movement, but I’m not welcome in their club, even
                though I achieved financial freedom when I was 34. Maybe I am welcome,
                and I’m just being a highly sensitive diva. Yeah, that’s most likely it . . . and
                my wife agrees. So let me rephrase that. I ‘feel’ unwelcome because most
                are buy & hold bigots.<br><br>
                Bigots are people who are intolerant toward those holding different
                opinions. They tend to chastise anyone who doesn’t believe what they
                believe. These buy & hold bigots also have nothing good to say about
                actively trading the stock market. They usually, not always, but typically
                stereotype active investors like me and are closed-minded to what I have to
                teach. They say things like . . .
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>“You can’t time the market."</li><br>
                       <li> "Dollar cost averaging into a broad-based index fund is the way to
                        go."</li><br>
                       <li> "Active trading is a loser’s game, and you can’t consistently beat the
                        stock market average over a long period of time."</li><br>
                       <li> "It’s impossible to beat the professionals at their own game as you
                        don’t have their knowledge, training, or resources.”</li><br>
                       <li><strong> “Options trading is risky. You say you trade options like Warren
                        Buffett, but he hates options. Quoting Buffett might draw readers,
                        but your methods obviously have nothing to do with the investing
                        legend.”</strong></li>
                </ul>

                <p>All the above bullet points are firmly held beliefs that are stated as facts. In
                    life, you can find many examples that prove these statements false. The last
                    bullet point exemplifies the dangers of being a bigot. You look stupid when
                    you speak with authority, but you are wrong.<br>
                    Bigotry = Ignorance!<br><br>

                    I trade options, and the most profitable strategy I have ever discovered, I
                    learned from Warren Buffett. That’s right, the “investing legend” uses
                    options via his company Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (Cfa, 2009). It’s hard for
                    anyone to convince me that Buffett hates options when he has used them to
                    earn billions in profit. So if you’re a buy & hold bigot who thinks Mr.
                    Buffett hates options, take the time to read his shareholder letters where he
                    outlines the options strategy he occasionally uses.<br><br>
                
                </p>

                <p>Moving on . . .<br><br>
                    Buy & hold fanatics proudly brag about their ‘average returns’ while
                    vilifying active investors like me. When the stock market crashes, and 40–
                    50% of their money evaporates, they rally together and say, "This is normal.
                    The market runs in cycles. Just keep investing.” My translation: bend over
                    and take the loss because this is normal. If getting screwed financially and
                    watching my account massively drop in value is normal, then, no thanks; I
                    want a new normal!<br><br>
                    I’m not the only one. Most students come my way because they are fed up
                    with that investing style. Watching 50% of your money disappear while you
                    helplessly sit there and watch it happen is terrifying. It’s even worse for
                    retirees. A loss like that often causes them to reenter the corporate world
                    when they should be traveling the world and enjoying retirement.<br><br>
                    Buy & hold is fantastic until you experience the flaws firsthand. So I
                    understand why people want to learn how to trade the stock market actively.
                    I get it! However, before we move on to active trading, a quick investing
                    example to defend buy & hold.<br><br>
                    Please note: I will use figures from my broker’s historical pricing feature or
                    actual transactions I placed in my account for any examples I provide in the
                    book. If using historical data, I use the prices listed at the end of the trading
                    day. Also, I round the figures to the nearest dollar in many examples. That
                    said, let’s cover an example of buy & hold.</p>

                <p><img src="img/1.webp"/></p>
                <p>Figure 2 Stock chart of SPY, Source: StockCharts.com</p>

                <p>The start date is January 14, 2021. You buy 400 shares of SPDR S&P 500
                    ETF Trust (stock symbol: SPY, often pronounced as S.P.Y. or simply spy).
                    It’s an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks the S&P 500. ETFs will be
                    explained in a later chapter, but for now, know the price of the ETF at the
                    time of purchase was $378.46. So the total investment was $151,384 for
                    400 shares. Fast forward to January 18, 2022, and SPY has risen in price to
                    $456.49.<br><br>
                    That’s a gain of $31,212, or 20.6%, on your 400 shares. That’s
                    outstanding! And what did you have to do to earn that profit? Absolutely
                    nothing! The beauty of buy & hold is that you benefit from the long-term
                    trend of American capitalism. You put your money into the stock market, sit
                    back, and earn passive income with little to no effort.<br><br>
                    Now let’s move forward another year to January 19, 2023. SPY is trading at
                    $388.64 a share. You lost $27,140, or -14.9%. You have lost most of last
                    year’s profit and are essentially back to where you started in 2021. Two
                    years of your life have passed, and you’ve made a small profit overall.</p>
                    <p><img src="img/2.webp"/></p>
                    <p>Figure 3 Stock chart of SPY during the 2022 Bear Market, Source: StockCharts.com</p>
                <p>The previous profit and loss example illustrates how investing can
                    sometimes be an emotional and financial roller coaster. Remember that this
                    type of movement is typical, and it’s the price we pay to get rich in the
                    stock market. Also, passive income in the stock market works both ways. If
                    you make money passively, you can also lose it passively. Making money
                    with little to no effort on your part is fun. However, losing it from being
                    passive makes you feel completely helpless.
                    </p>

                    <p>Before we move on, let me be crystal clear. Yes, buy & hold works. There is
                        an overwhelming amount of evidence proving that buy & hold works. I
                        don’t dispute that. However, what angers me is that financial experts push it
                        down people’s throats without empathy for the financial and emotional
                        destruction it causes when things go wrong. Especially for retirees who
                        count on that money lasting for the rest of their lives.<br><br>
                        Watching 40–50% of my money disappear and then doing nothing about it
                        is reckless. That’s why I dislike traditional buy & hold. It does not
                        adequately protect you during market crashes. So, if that’s the problem,
                        what is my proposed solution?<br><br>
                        I’ll get to my current solution in a later chapter, but the first solution I tried
                        was actively trading the stock market. With active trading, you control your
                        gains and losses more. And as you’ll see in an upcoming example, you can
                        often make as much, or more money, than buy & hold while risking less
                        money. Sadly though, the benefits of actively managing your money can
                        also make you a bigot.
                        </p>

            <h3>WHY I USED TO BE AN ACTIVE TRADING BIGOT</h3>     
            
            <p>Bigotry is also present in the active trading community. I know because I
                used to be one. I thought buy & hold investors were stupid to settle for 7–
                9% a year when I was earning 15–30% by actively trading the stock market.
                I was biased because of my real-world experience with active trading.<br><br>

                Let me show an example of why I was such a bigot, and I will explain the
                mechanics of the investment that produced this type of return in a later
                chapter. We will use the same start and end dates as earlier, January 14,
                2021 to January 18, 2022. However, I will buy six call option contracts
                instead of stock shares. Again, I’ll explain the mechanics of options in a
                later chapter, but for now, follow the big picture. Options are an investment
                tool that allows you to benefit from stock price movement without owning
                the stock. Moving on . . .<br><br>
                I’ll start with the same $151,384 I have to invest, but this time, I’ll only use
                roughly 20% of it to buy call options. On January 14, 2021, I purchased six
                December 2023, 380 call options @ $4,877 per contract, a total investment
                of $29,262. Fast forward to January 18, 2022, and I was able to sell those
                calls for $10,429 per contract (a $5,552 profit per contract). Since I bought
                six contracts, that’s a total gain of $33,312 or 113.8%.</p>
                <p>Now let’s compare the two approaches . . .</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>With buy & hold, I invested $151,384 to make a profit of $31,212 or
                        20.6% on my original investment. Note: 100% of my money was at
                        risk of loss to get that return.</li><br>
                    <li>
                        With call options, I invested $29,262. Less than 1/5 of the buy &
                        hold investment. Yet, I walked away with a profit of $33,312, or a
                        113.8% return on my original investment. I didn’t invest all my
                        money, but that $33K profit grew my overall account by 22%.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong> With options, I had a bigger profit, a higher percent return, and I
                    risked less of my money! </strong>I grew my overall account by 22% while leaving
                    most of it safely in cash, protected from a market crash. Can you see how
                    fifteen-plus years of performance like that would make me biased? As you
                    can see, I can often beat the market’s average return with active trading.<br><br>
                   
                    Right now, some critic of options is ready to send me hate mail about how
                    this example is misleading and doesn’t talk about losses. If so, chill out,
                    crabby pants! I’ll get to the risk of losing money with options next. I’m
                    merely showing how my experience with options made me an active trading
                    bigot.<br><br>

                    That said, let’s talk about losing money. Yes, the call option return of
                    113.8% was incredible, but don’t get so excited that you forget the outsized
                    return also works in reverse. It’s best never to forget that. How would you
                    feel if you had lost 100% of your investment? Because that is what almost
                    happened the year after this significant gain. If you buy a new set of call
                    options and fast forward another year to January 19, 2023, the next round of
                    calls loses $26,700. This is similar to the buy & hold loss of $27,140 during
                    the same period. However, the 67.9% percent loss on the options is
                    stomach-churning.<br><br>

                    Too many investors are so enticed by the big profits that options deliver that
                    they get sloppy, risk too much money, and eventually lose it all. I’ve seen it
                    happen too many times in my twenty-plus-year career. Heck, it happened to
                    me a few times early in my journey. It almost happened to me again in the
                    bear market of 2022, but I was smart enough to correct my errors before
                    they caused too much financial damage. This illustrates that sometimes I
                    make mistakes, or often life gets in the way of active trading, and I fail to
                    beat the performance of a simple buy & hold approach.<br><br>

                    In summary, both approaches have pros and cons. In my experience,
                    integrating the best of both worlds is the best solution. And that is precisely
                    what we will discuss in the next chapter.</p>
