         <h3></h3>
         <p>I studied wealthy people since the early 90s and achieved financial freedom at 34 years old. At this point, I’ve invested well over $100,000 in courses, coaches, and seminars to learn the ‘secrets’ of the rich. And you know what? It was worth it! The information helped me become a first-generation millionaire. However, I discovered an ugly truth that most product promoters don’t tell you. Well, several truths, actually.</p>

         <ol>
           <li>
             <p>There really are no ‘secrets.’ The concept of secrets will sell courses because, let’s face it, we’re suckers for information that we think will give us an advantage over our investment peers.</p>
           </li>
           <li>
             <p>There is no one ideal path. There are hundreds of ways to get rich (gasp). And . . .</p>
           </li>
           <li>
             <p>You can charge more for a complicated strategy, but the more complicated something is, the more chances you will screw it up. Complicated strategies make you feel smart, but simple elementary strategies usually make the most money in the long run. At least, that has been my experience.</p>
           </li>
         </ol>
         
         <p>So, after much research and studying wealth for over two decades, I want to share the simplest path to stock market wealth I have ever discovered. Please note that I didn’t say it’s the best or the most profitable. I said it’s the simplest. And you know what? I have discovered that the simpler something is, the more success I have with it. Without any further delay, here is the plan . . .</p>
         
         <p>My family follows what I call a one-stock retirement plan. I discovered one stock that provides income and adequate growth and keeps the risk of losing our money as low as possible. Why would I invest my money elsewhere if I could get all those benefits from one stock? Even Warren Buffett, one of the world’s most famous investors, often recommends that people put their money into this one investment (Locke, 2021/2022). So, who am I to argue with the wisdom of a billionaire? Thus, our core holding is the S&P 500.</p>
         
         <p>The S&P 500, created in 1926, tracks the rise and fall of the 500 largest stocks trading on U.S. exchanges. The S&P 500 is arguably the most critical market performance measure used by investors and traders worldwide. With just one investment, you get instant exposure to the entire market at a low cost. However, there is one hiccup.</p>
         <p>You can’t directly buy the S&P 500. But you can invest in its alternative, <strong>SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust</strong> (stock symbol: <strong>SPY</strong>). It’s an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks the S&P 500. Broad-based ETFs, like SPY, are more diversified and have less risk and volatility than individual stocks.</p>

         <p>Individual stocks concentrate my risk of loss into one company. However, SPY spreads my risk of loss across 500 companies.</p>
         
         <p>SPY is also the oldest and one of the most heavily traded ETFs. So if you’re looking for an excellent investment, it’s hard to beat the S&P 500. Do you want to own the top tech stocks? How about the leading consumer brands? Maybe you want to own whatever sector is the hottest right now. Yes, those are all in the S&P 500, and when you buy it, you instantly own the best stocks in the U.S. economy.</p>
         
         <p>It’s also hard to screw up a one-stock S&P 500 retirement plan. Even my wife, who hates thinking about investing, can follow that. The conversation went something like this: “Hey honey, from now on, we will put all of our money into the S&P 500 through SPY or our Vanguard S&P 500 mutual fund. If I die, and you get life insurance, dump it into the S&P 500 and forget about it.” She replied, “Sounds good to me!” and then moved on with her life.</p>
         
         <p>Now consider if I told her this: “Hey honey, dump 60% of our money into Fund A, 10% into Fund B, 12% into Fund C, and another 18% into Fund D. And oh, don’t forget to rebalance each year if things get out of whack.” There are so many potential problems with the more complicated approach that I don’t even have time to get into them in this book. First, my wife, who hates math, needs to break out a calculator to get the allocation percentages correct. Then, my wife, who is extremely scatterbrained and overstimulated by our children’s requests, has to remember to rebalance each year. This is the same woman who doesn’t even know her login ID to her retirement account. That’s how infrequently she looks at it.</p>
                  
         <p>And no, I’m not talking about my wife behind her back. I’m not that stupid, ha-ha. I had her approve these comments <em>(smile)</em>.</p>

         <p>In theory, my wife can handle a complicated investment strategy, but I live in a world of reality, and I know she needs simplicity. Thus, I switched all my accounts to this simple one-stock blueprint. As a savvy investor, I can handle a complicated strategy and would do fine. However, I won’t live forever, and I don’t want my wife to inherit a big mess of confusion she has no idea how to handle.</p>
         
         <p>Now we focus on a single stock; it’s like owning an apartment building with 500 individual units managed by someone else. We no longer have to stress about a lousy company earnings report. We have saved hundreds of hours because we don’t have to research individual company stocks extensively. There is no single company bankruptcy risk. And the SPY ETF collects the dividends issued by all the dividend-paying stocks in the S&P 500 and sends that money to us.</p>
         
         <p>The SPY ETF has become the ultimate ‘set it and forget it’ stock we can hold forever and even pass down to our kids. More importantly, SPY has listed options to trade. That means with just one stock . . .</p>
         
         <ul>
           <li>We can achieve growth through call options and stock price appreciation.</li>
           <li>We can generate income through stock dividends and option selling strategies.</li>
           <li>We can obtain market crash protection through put options.</li>
         </ul>
         
         <p>Growth, income, and market crash protection—it’s the trifecta of wealth building. For us, there are more pros than cons to using this one stock blueprint. And again, it’s also the simplest path to wealth I have ever encountered. This style of investing is also known as index fund investing.</p>
         
         <p>And with that said, I have a confession . . .</p>
         
         <p>I have to give credit where credit is due. Guess who I learned this simple investing strategy from? The same buy & hold bigots I talked about in a previous chapter. I learned several of my most profitable insights from buy & hold bigots, and one is the benefits of investing in broad-based index funds.</p>
         
         <p>Index fund investing is not exciting, but it can make you rich. Studies even show that the large majority of actively managed funds fail to beat the performance of the S&P 500 (Coleman, 2023). That’s a simple truth I learned from the buy & hold investors I used to ridicule and make fun of. Now I appreciate them because I have learned a ton and made more money because of their wisdom. So yeah, I gave them a hard time earlier in the book, but I agree with them to an extent.</p>
         <p>I don’t believe ‘average people’ can consistently beat the stock market’s
            performance, nor should they try to. Ninety percent of the population (the
            average investor) should adopt a simple buy & hold approach using lowcost index funds. If you do that, you’ll outperform the majority of your
            peers. Said another way, invest as average people do if you want average
            results. But consider this, being an average investor is a choice. You can
            also choose to be an above-average investor and put in the work necessary
            to develop those skills. That said, let’s talk about the rules I follow . . .</p>

            <h3>MY RULES FOR THE ETF BUY & HOLD SHARES</h3>

    <p>
        I break all the rules of traditional diversification and put roughly 80% of my account into the S&P 500 through the ETF SPY. The other 20% of my account will be devoted to call and put options on SPY.
    </p>

    <p>
        No matter how many shares I own, I will always have the shares paired up with SPY call and put options. I follow a 1:1 ratio.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>1:1 ratio example:</strong> Since one option contract represents 100 shares of a stock, you match the number of option contracts with the corresponding number of stock shares. So, 100 shares of stock would be paired up with one option contract. I use 50 shares as the transition point. For example...
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>0 to 150 shares of stock are paired up with one call option and one put option.</li>
        <li>151 to 250 shares of stock are paired up with two calls and two puts.</li>
        <li>Etc. Etc.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        My favorite part of this blueprint is that I plan on holding these shares for life! I never plan on selling them. The goal is to keep accumulating shares over time so that dividends can support our lifestyle. Any extra money we make from options will be used to buy more SPY shares. Why is that? Because it’s passive income investing. We make money without lifting a finger.
    </p>

    <p>
        The option profit, on the other hand, is active income. Yes, it’s leverage
        returns and better than buy & hold, but it still requires me to show up to
        generate those profits. What if I’m making $100,000 a year as an active
        trader, and then I have a stroke like my brother did in his early 40s? My
        entire income and livelihood go bye-bye in an instant. That’s a risk I used to
        be comfortable taking, but not anymore. His stroke freaked me out, and I
        saw another flaw in active trading. Active trading income depends on the
        best-case scenario (i.e., always being around to trade your account).
    </p>

    <p>
        However, with buy & hold, all I have to do is ‘buy’ and then ‘hold’ for life. Another benefit of holding for life and never selling is that I will never have to pay taxes on my gains. And then, as an accountant once told me, our kids can inherit our portfolio on a stepped-up cost basis. Their cost basis for tax purposes will be the value of the stocks the day they inherited them, not the price I paid for them. However, please double-check with a qualified tax professional. I’m not an accountant, and the rules could have changed by the time you read this book.
    </p>

    <p>
        Full disclosure: The ‘plan’ is to hold them for life, but sometimes life gets messy. If we ever need money, we are not averse to selling off a bit of stock to come up with the cash, like when we gifted money to elderly family members so they could purchase their dream home.
    </p>

    <h2>My Buy & Hold Management Rules</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>There is zero management of these shares during the year or EVER!</li>
        <li>I set it and forget it.</li>
        <li>When it’s time to do the annual reset/rebalance of my portfolio, I don’t do anything with the shares except maybe buy more. The rebalancing is for the option positions only.</li>
        <li>And as I accumulate more shares, I buy more calls and puts to accompany those shares.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Let me stop here in case you have the following question: “So Travis, are you telling me to just put all of my money into the S&P 500?”
    </p>

    <p>
        It’s a great question, and it gives me a chance to explain that I’m not a financial advisor and can’t give you investment advice. I don’t know the particulars of your financial situation, and the small details matter a lot. I am only an expert in what I did to rapidly build wealth, retire early, and ensure I don’t lose my accumulated wealth. Thus, I take the position of an educator. I share what I do and try my best to explain all the reasonings and logic behind my decisions.
    </p>

    <p>
        Then I share a low-risk way for you to test the concepts yourself. It’s called paper or virtual trading. Paper trading is where you go through all the motions of investing, but you don’t use real money. One of the many reasons you should paper trade first is because it’s a cautious approach that ensures you learn how to use the tools correctly.
    </p>

    <p>
        I don’t think you should invest real money until you understand what you are doing. You don’t want to lose money unnecessarily. When you’re new to investing or trading options, it takes a while to master the technical aspects of it. But once you learn the mechanics, you can slowly transition to real money, where you discover how to manage the emotional part of investing.
    </p>

    <p>
        Overcoming the fear of losing money and the greed for more is not easy at first. For this reason, it’s best to tackle one skill at a time—mechanics first and emotions second. It’s a more cautious and deliberate approach, and the students who follow that route tend to have a higher success rate than those who don’t.
    </p>

    <p>
        People who scoff at paper trading are often arrogant, impatient, and don’t have the discipline to delay the gratification of earning real money. I’ll let you guess if those character traits lead to success (wink).
    </p>

    <p>
        That leads to another question I often get from people turned off by the simple approach of buying index funds: “Travis, why don’t you buy individual stocks? You can make more money.” Because if I buy a stock, I have created more work for myself. I must keep up with the company to ensure it remains a good investment. That means continuously monitoring the company fundamentals and paying attention to any new players that enter the market who could threaten the company’s profit. This can take upwards of 10+ hours a week.
    </p>

    <p>It also means I must know how to analyze a company’s financials and
        understand terms like EBITDA to understand its earnings better. The
        definition of EBITDA is irrelevant to our discussion. Still, I think the
        average person should not invest in individual stocks unless they master
        what a good business looks like. However, the extra effort may not be a big
        deal if you’re already a business owner familiar with what it takes to run a
        successful business.</p>
    
        <p>In summary, an S&P 500 index fund is less effort than buying individual
        stocks. Once I buy an index fund, my job is done, and I outsource the
        management of it to someone else. They will do all the work of keeping
        track of the companies in the index, and I can sit back and enjoy my life. It
        saves me time, and I still win financially. So with all the great benefits of
        index fund investing, what are the tradeoffs?</p>
    
        <p>The main one is performance. In theory, I could make more money by
        buying individual stocks, but I don’t need to. I make up for the performance
        difference with call options. This way, I get the gains of a great stock
        investor without the hassle of investing in individual stocks. It’s the same
        reason I no longer buy bonds. I don’t need to. I use put options for
        protection in down markets. I’ll stop here because, by now, I think you get
        my point. I love the simplicity of index fund investing!</p>
    
        <p>Now a quick recap of what we have discussed thus far:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You discovered how to rapidly build wealth with LEAP call options.</li>
            <li>You learned to invest with broad-based exchange-traded funds passively.</li>
            <li>And you also discovered how to use LEAP put options to protect your wealth from market crashes.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <p>Now let’s wrap up this chapter with the distinction between investing and
        short-term trading. All three components of the enhanced buy & hold
        portfolio, calls, stock shares, and puts, could be traded. What I mean by
        trading is buying and selling calls, puts, and stock shares on a short-term
        basis. It’s also called market timing, and we are avoiding that with the EBH
        portfolio.</p>
    
        <p>There are hundreds of ways to ‘trade’ options. And yes, with enhanced buy
        & hold, I am technically trading options because I close them once a year
        and purchase new ones. However, that’s because it’s a prudent way of
        managing the negatives of options (i.e., expiration dates, time decay, etc.).
        Trading once a year is a conservative approach to trading options.</p>
    
        <p>We are buying and holding stocks and options. We are not actively trading
        stocks and options. Once the enhanced buy & hold portfolio is set up, it’s
        left alone until a year later when it’s time to rebalance it. If you want to
        actively trade in and out of the market, please read Options Trading Made
        Simple. That’s where I covered active trading.</p>
    
        <p>This book and strategy are about buying and holding. Don’t miss that point!
        I’m trying to show you how to avoid all the costly mistakes other options
        traders make. And one of those mistakes is ignoring the benefit of buy &
        hold. Again, buy & hold is the granddaddy of all passive stock market
        strategies.</p>
    
        <p>Think about it. Is options income truly passive? Yes and no. Yes, we
        generate outsized returns with little work on our part. However, options still
        need to be managed. They have expiration dates; we can’t just set and
        forget them. However, with index fund investing, we can technically set it
        and forget it. There are no expiration dates, and the dividends are paid to us
        automatically.</p>
    
        <p>In summary, the enhanced buy & hold portfolio is passive. It’s primarily
        long-term investing. And with EBH, I buy an ETF that tracks the S&P 500.
        I then pair this up with call options and put options I buy once a year. It’s
        simple, easy, and, best of all, it works!</p>
