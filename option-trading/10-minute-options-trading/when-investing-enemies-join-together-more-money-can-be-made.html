                <h3>WHEN INVESTING ENEMIES JOIN TOGETHER,
                    MORE MONEY CAN BE MADE</h3>

            <p>I started an online coaching program in 2010 to teach investors how to be
                active option traders. I received the above note from one of the graduates
                of that class. Michelle, like I, was fed up with the flaws and dangers of buy
                & hold. The pain of a massive buy & hold loss is also why I became an
                active trader.<br><br>
                However, is active trading better than buy & hold? I used to think so, but as
                I got older, I discovered it’s not sustainable long term. Do you remember in
                the Preface where I shared how our buy & hold retirement account beat my
                active trading account in 2013? <br><br>

                Yes, I generated a respectable return of 30% on my money for the year.
                However, I had sorted through hundreds of stock charts during the year,
                spent countless hours at my computer, racked up thousands in broker
                commissions, and yet, our retirement account, which we never even looked
                at, did better.<br><br>

                I saw the flaw in active investing for the first time in years. As an active
                trader, I was used to earning 15–30% yearly returns. I won the U.S.
                Investing Championship with a return of 31.6% in one year. However, with
                active stock market trading, you need the following:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Lots of free time and a stoic-like personality.</li>
                     <li>A calm demeanor where you keep irrational emotions under control.</li>
                     <li>Little to no stress in your personal life.</li>
                     <li>And you also need the mental capacity to handle the demands of
                        active investing.</li>
                </ul>
        <p>Thus, you will struggle with active stock market trading if you have a busy
            work life or many personal demands on your time. It’s precisely why active
            investing has such a high failure rate.<br><br>
            Think about it. What’s the demographic of most active or day trading gurus
            online? Most of them are young with no kids . . . people who traditionally
            have much more free time than a parent or middle-aged corporate worker.
            Conversely, do many sixty-year-old day trading gurus promote their courses
            online?<br><br>
            There are ‘old traders’ and ‘active traders,’ but there aren’t many old active
            traders. There’s a reason for that. The older group has discovered
            something, but the younger ones have not—something I learned in 2013
            when I was busy building a coaching business and was mentally burnt out.
            It showed in my trading performance.</p>
            <p>The lesson: Your active trading performance will suffer when you suffer.
                Your results depend highly on you and what you have going on in your
                personal life. If you bring your A-game to active trading, you can often beat
                the market’s average return. However, when you perform less than your
                best, you underperform.<br><br>

                Thus, passive investing is the best approach for busy people. Despite its
                apparent flaws, my eyes were finally opened to the fact that buy & hold ‘is’
                one of the most passive ways to build wealth. The benefit of passive
                investing is that it still sets you up for success, but your results aren’t
                heavily dependent on your moves. You simply invest your money in the
                stock market and let the market do all the hard work for you.<br><br>

                Passive investing is like starting a business and hiring employees to do all
                the work. Active investing is like starting a business where you do all the
                work yourself. You handle accounting, marketing, sales, product
                fulfillment, customer support, etc. It’s exhausting!
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>So, how about your life? Is it perfect?</li>
                    <li>Do you have an abundance of free time?</li>
                    <li>Does everything always go as planned?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>That’s a big fat no in my life, so I switched to passive investing. However, I
                    refuse to completely abandon options because they give me more control
                    over my income, and I make too much money with them. The best solution
                    I have found is to integrate the best of both worlds. And that is what we will
                    discuss next.
                    </p>
                <h3>BUY & HOLD + OPTIONS TRADING</h3>
                <p>After my active trading disappointment, I needed to shift how I invested my
                    money. However, it was difficult to change my investing style after using it
                    for 15+ years. It took a mindset shift I frankly wasn’t ready for. I assume it
                    had the same effect on me as someone who has worked for a company for
                    15 years and then gets laid off. You’re a bit lost initially and must find your
                    way again. You’re essentially starting all over again.</p>
                    <p>Regardless, I needed a strategy to accommodate the changes in my personal life. When I started as an active trader, I was young, single, and had no kids. Then I got married, had three kids, and got older. And with age and more responsibilities came a harder season of life.</p>
<p>I held on to active trading as long as I could, but I eventually had to say goodbye. Again, shifting from active options trading to enhanced buy & hold investing took work. It is best to be open-minded for enhanced buy & hold to work well. Remember, I was an active trading bigot at the time.</p>
<p>It was also challenging because I had to learn from buy & hold bigots who tried to program me with their limiting beliefs. For example, many disagreed with my views on beating the market and immediately dismissed the idea. Again, that’s the exact kind of bigoted mindset I cautioned you about in a previous chapter.</p>
<p>Bigots will fail with enhanced buy & hold and won’t beat my investment returns because they are too stubborn to see the simple truths right before their faces. Please note: I’m speaking about myself. My bigotry closed my eyes to other ‘truths’ that could benefit my life.</p>
<p>Luckily, I met a millionaire who taught me a better way of thinking. He said, "Don’t be an ‘either or thinker.’ Be a ‘both’ thinker. Don’t think buy & hold versus active options investing. Think both. Learn both methods, implement the best of each approach, and get double the benefit.”</p>
<p>It makes perfect sense when you stop and think about it, but again, bigotry closes your eyes to other ways of seeing the world. This is highly evident in the world of politics. I’ve noticed that people who are dogmatic and inflexible in their thinking tend to make horrible investors over the long term.</p>
<p>Again, this is my opinion; it doesn’t make it a fact. Regardless, my current stance on bigotry is that I let the dummies debate the details! The war between buy & hold investors and active traders is exhausting—a battle I was once a part of.</p>
<p>Now I let those idiots get into pointless arguments about the best method. While those dummies debate details, curious and open minds study both approaches. And that leads to the secret to ‘how’ I can consistently beat the stock market average.</p>
<p>I integrate buy & hold with options trading! I combined ‘conservative’ buy & hold with ‘conservative’ options trading to earn 12%, 32%, or even 45% on my money each year. Of course, your results may vary.</p>
<p>To illustrate this point, let’s first review and then combine the two approaches covered in the previous chapter. Here they are again for your reference:</p>
<ul>
  <li>With buy & hold, we invested $151,384 to make a profit of $31,212, or a 20.6% return on the original investment. Note: 100% of the money was at risk of loss to get that return.</li>
  <li>With call options, we invested $29,262. Yet, we walked away with a profit of $33,312, or a 113.8% return on the original investment. Note: Roughly 80% of the account was in cash, uninvested, and protected from market crashes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now let’s combine the approaches to make up two of the three parts of the enhanced buy & hold portfolio. We will start with the total buy & hold investment of $151,384, but we will strategically split the money between stock shares and option contracts.</p>
<ul>
  <li>$29,262 will be devoted to six call option contracts.</li>
  <li>The remaining $122,122 will go towards buying 322 shares of SPY.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this example, most of the money is devoted to buy & hold as the long-term risk of losing money is lower, and the rest is dedicated to the riskier option trades. It’s roughly an 80/20 split. It is just enough money in options to give you a nice profit boost in up markets, but not so much that you get destroyed financially when the market falls in price. As I stated in my book Options Trading Made Simple, the way to win with options is to risk less money, not more.</p>
<p>Okay, let me return to the example before I lose my train of thought . . .</p>
<p>We have invested the same $151K as we did with pure buy & hold, and we are using the exact start and end dates, January 2021 to January 2022. Now let’s see the results of this 80/20 setup:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A $25,126 profit on the 322 stock shares, or a 20.6% return on investment.</li>
  <li>And a $33,312 profit on the six call options, or a 113.8% return on investment.</li>
</ul>
<p>The combined profit of $58,438 allowed us to grow our overall account by 38.6% in one year, while the pure buy & hold return was only 20.6%. This enhanced performance is what I discovered once I stopped being a bigot. By combining the best of both approaches, I make more money!</p>
<p>However, don’t salivate over that incredible return because the returns will be slightly lower when you see the complete enhanced buy & hold portfolio. Regardless, when people tell me that options are risky and I can’t beat the return of buy & hold, I smile and silently say to myself, “You can keep your opinion, and I’ll keep all the money I’m making from doing what you say is impossible.”</p>
<p>Now that I have tickled your greed gland, let’s pause here to talk about losing money (again). I want to caution you about following this buy & hold + call blueprint long term. It has two potential downfalls. The first is that the high returns will trigger your emotions, but not in a good way. Making money quickly is intoxicating and causes people to be too greedy over time.</p>
<p>The second downfall is that the losses can be so significant in down markets that it triggers panic emotions. Adding calls to your buy & hold portfolio will give you super performance, but the tradeoff is that it puts you in a position to lose more than the market when prices fall. Here is an example of the panic emails I get from people who didn’t listen to my warnings about risking too much money on calls:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“I lost 80% of the value of my calls. My account is down more than the market. I’m losing too much money! What can I do?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That statement is EXACTLY why you shouldn’t focus on the fast growth of calls. With investing, you want to avoid anything that will trigger your emotions. When emotions are high, intelligence is down. Want proof? Think about controversial presidential elections. Don’t ordinary intelligent people lose their minds and act like idiots? Why? Because their emotions are triggered. Enough politics; let me ask you an important question . . .</p>
<p>What puts people out of business, making lots of money, or losing lots of money? It’s not a trick question, I promise. I’m asking because people rarely think about it. When people see the results of the buy & hold + call blueprint, I’d estimate 97% of them focus on how much money it made. Oddly enough, trying to make a tremendous amount of money is not how I, or many others, achieved financial freedom. I didn’t get rich when I focused solely on making money. Instead, I kept failing.</p>
<p>However, when I focused on avoiding the activities that cause people to go broke or lose too much money, that’s when building wealth became easier. So, when you encounter an opportunity that has the potential to increase your wealth rapidly, you have to stop and force yourself to focus on where things can go wrong. Then you make a plan to avoid financial ruin. After that’s done, then and only then do you focus on the money-making opportunity.</p>
<p>That said, in a few chapters, I’ll share my solution to avoiding financial ruin. It was an adjustment I made to the blueprint. After walking others through this blueprint, I noticed some, like me, were not bothered by losses, while others became emotionally unraveled. Thus, I made a few tweaks to accommodate that we are all emotionally wired differently. I added a market crash component, so people didn’t freak out from losing money so quickly in down markets. I also made the options portion of the blueprint more passive to align with the passive nature of buy & hold. And that last tweak helped clients develop more discipline and patience—two of the necessary ingredients for financial success.</p>
<p>Now let’s wrap up this chapter with a criticism I received about my high performance.</p>
<p>By combining the best of both approaches, I’ve earned above-average market returns, even though my total financial investment was similar to traditional buy & hold. Of course, I’m not implying you can do that or will. I’m just sharing what I’ve been able to do. Similar to the time I tried to share with a group of buy & hold investors what I had accomplished with options trading. It was on the blog of a famous finance guru who goes by the name of Mr. Money Mustache. However, in the comment section, here is what one buy & hold critic had to say about my options trading return in 2015:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Just so people know. Options Trading CAN be very profitable via dumb luck, especially when you’re at the volatile end of a bull market. You can get lucky and exploit people who think the market will continue to rise like it did in 2012 thru 2014. You can also get very lucky trading on the volatility. I’m not surprised that someone made a 211% return in the options market last year. I just question anyone who advertises it as anything but dumb luck. One data point achieved during a perfect storm of economic events does not make for sound long-term investing advice” — (WHAT TO DO ABOUT THIS SCARY STOCK MARKET, 2016)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sigh . . . First, let’s get a few things straight here. I can’t make any promises about what you can or will achieve. But I do promise to show you what has worked for me and the exact steps I’ve taken to earn additional income, protect my investments, and experience freedom in my life. That’s my new mission now that I’m free from the rat race of corporate America. I’m now teaching regular people how to invest safely, confidently, and profitably.</p>
<p>Second, in my previous example, you saw how the calls generated a 113.8% return on our investment. Those results are easily verifiable. Thus, it shouldn’t be too much of a stretch to consider that one could earn 211% with options. Then again, critics never take the time to verify.</p>
<p>Third, I take full responsibility for the events that led to my message being rejected. In my excitement to share what I had achieved, I didn’t stop to think if that was the right audience for the message. It clearly wasn’t. So let me be a little blunter to ensure the message I preach is for you.</p>
<p>If you are a closed-minded buy & hold bigot, please go elsewhere. You honestly aren’t qualified to learn my strategies. It will severely challenge your worldview. What I teach is not for ignorant people or people who want to be average. It’s only for people who desire to be ‘above average’ . . . people who are ‘open-minded’ . . . and people who want to be in a position to have ‘dumb luck’ like me. If that’s you, continue on.</p>
<p>The following chapters will introduce you to the three enhanced buy & hold components: call options, put options, and index fund investing. You’ll also discover the precise rules I follow.</p>
