         <h3>HOW TO RAPIDLY BUILD WEALTH</h3>
         <p>In the previous chapter, I shared how a buy & hold fanatic implied that my
            211% return on my money in 2015 resulted from “dumb luck.” In this
            chapter, I will describe the tool that allowed me to have such dumb luck. It
            was call options (or calls for short). It’s also the tool that allowed me to
            rapidly build wealth and achieve financial freedom in a short period of
            time.</p>
            <p>To set your expectations, I will not be detailing my moves to earn that
                211%. I’m looking at those trades right now in my trade journal Excel.
                However, they are from my active trading days, and I no longer invest that
                way. Again, active trading is, in my experience, not sustainable long term.
                With a few family deaths, caring for an aging parent, a divorce, or if life
                generally gets in the way, you will struggle with active options trading.</p>
            <p>I’m now a passive options trader and only trade roughly once a year. The
                tradeoff is that my performance is slightly lower. However, I can live with
                that tradeoff because I now have more free time. And at my age, having
                more time is more valuable than a few more dollars in my bank account.
                Personal freedom is priceless!</p>
            <h3>CALL OPTION BASICS</h3>
            
            <p>In Options Trading Made Simple, the first book in this series, I thoroughly covered stock options basics. Since this is the second book in the series, and for the sake of brevity, I won’t rehash all of that material here. I will, however, touch on the big-picture overview of call options so you can understand why they are a vital component of the enhanced buy & hold portfolio. Afterward, if you need more knowledge, please read Options Trading Made Simple, or review free options basics tutorials online.</p>
            <p>Call options don’t represent ownership like stock shares but are contracts that grant you specific rights. They are similar to real estate contracts. With a real estate purchase contract:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>You have the right to purchase a ‘property’ at a set price on or before a specific date. The contract expires after this date.</li>
              <li>You also have to put down a small deposit or premium.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>And when you ‘buy’ a call option contract:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>You have the right to purchase ‘stock’ at a set price on or before a specific date. The contract expires after this date.</li>
              <li>You also have to put down a small deposit or premium.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Also, options are contracts between two parties. So if you exercised the above rights, the seller of the call would be obligated to sell you the shares you wanted to buy.</p>
            <p>See, options aren’t that hard to understand, are they? That said, let’s go into a little more detail. Options are relatively unknown to most stock market investors. And those who have heard about options are often told they are risky and should be avoided. This statement is primarily made out of ignorance because stock options were created to protect investors from risk (Contributor, 2019). In the case of call options, they were created so investors could place small bets on a stock’s price movement without tying up large sums of money.</p>
           
           
            <ul>
                <li>A person who buys one call option has the right, but not the obligation, to buy 100 stock shares at a set price on or before a specific date.</li>
                <li>When the rights of the option contract are exercised, the price the stock can be bought at is the option’s strike price.</li>
                <li>Since you are only buying a contract and not 100 shares of the stock, you only have to pay a small fee, known as the premium.</li>
                <li>Option premiums, or prices, are always listed as small numbers, but since the option contract controls 100 shares of stock, you have to multiply the premium by 100 to get the true cost of buying the option.</li>
                <li>The contract also has an expiration date and is only valid for a certain period of time.</li>
                <li>Because of the limited shelf life, the options suffer from a concept called time decay.</li></ul>

                <p>A little more about time decay before we move on. Part of an options premium, or cost, is time value. It’s a dollar figure assigned to how many days are left until the option expires. For example, options with longer expirations cost more because they provide more ‘time’ to be right about your options bet.</p>
                <p>Over time, the option’s price dwindles in value due to a concept called time decay. Time decay describes how the value of an options contract decreases as the option approaches its expiration date. A small portion of the option’s value is lost each day that passes. It starts as a slow decline and then speeds up the closer the option gets to its expiration date because there is less time to realize a profit from the trade. Picture an ice cube. You take it out of the freezer and put it in the sun. It starts melting slowly, but the longer it’s in the sun, the faster it will melt.</p>
                <p>Now, let’s look at an example call option trade: I buy one SPY December 15, 2023, 380 call option @ $48.77:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>This one call option gives me the right, but not the obligation, to buy one hundred shares of SPY.</li>
                  <li>380 is the strike price or the price for which I can purchase the stock.</li>
                  <li>$48.77 is the option’s premium (the actual cost is $4,877).</li>
                  <li>And the contract is only valid up until its expiration date of December 15, 2023. I have until this date to exercise the rights of the contract (i.e., buy the stock).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Here’s a hypothetical example of how calls can be used. Let’s say an investor wanted to buy 100 shares of stock XYZ @ $160 a share price. It would cost $16,000. If the stock went up in price, they would make money. However, if the stock falls in price, they could lose all $16,000. If the investor is nervous or unsure, they could buy a three-year 160 strike call option on stock XYZ for $10 (or $1,000) instead.</p>
                <p>So, for three years, the investor could monitor the stock. Because of the rights of the call contract, it will increase in value as the stock rises in price (and vice versa). This is also why options are known as derivatives. Their cost is derived from the price of something else, such as a stock or ETF.</p>
                <p>Suppose the investor gets lucky, and the stock increases to $190. They could exercise the rights of the call contract and buy the stock for $160 (a $30 discount).</p>
                <p>If the stock crashes in price to $80, the investor can walk away, and the most they lose is the $1,000 paid for the option contract. That’s less than the $8,000 they would have lost if they bought the 100 shares of stock.</p>
                <p>Also, if the stock went nowhere in price, the investor would lose the $1,000 paid for the option due to time decay. Please note: Call options are useless unless the stock increases in price.</p>
                <p>In summary, call options allow investors to place cheap bets that a stock will rise in price without buying the stock upfront. Yet, people say options are risky, HA! I’m just teasing. I know why people say options are risky. They are referring to ‘trading options.’ Yes, trading options can be risky if you misuse them, but if you prudently use them like Warren Buffett, you should be fine.</p>
                <p>Lastly, if you want to buy call options, you’ll need a brokerage account with permission to buy options contracts. Every brokerage has different criteria for approval, but the factors in their decision will include your experience as an investor and how much money you have in your account.</p>
                  <h3>My Favorite Stock for Call Options</h3> 
                  
                  <p>I primarily buy calls of an index, but here are a few definitions to help you understand. An index is a measure or method to track the performance of a group of assets. In the case of the Standard and Poor’s 500 (S&P 500), it’s an index that tracks the performance of the 500 strongest companies trading in the U.S. markets. It’s often used to gauge the stock market’s overall health or performance.</p>
            <p>An index fund is a mutual fund or ETF that seeks to replicate the performance of an index, often by holding the same stocks as the index itself. More specialized indexes also track a particular industry or segment of the overall stock market. However, I don’t use those. I prefer to use broad-based indexes that capture the entire stock market as a whole. Lastly, an exchange-traded fund, or ETF, is built like a mutual fund but can be bought or sold throughout the day like a stock.</p>
            <p>Now back to why I’m sharing this . . .</p>
            <p>You may remember the Buffett call if you read Options Trading Made Simple. If you did not read that book, it’s a call option that expires two to three years out in time, and I call it the Buffett call because I modeled it after Warren Buffett’s long-term options approach. The Buffett call is part of the enhanced buy & hold blueprint; now you can see how I integrate it into my overall portfolio. The Buffett call can technically be used on any stock, but I prefer using an index or exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks or mirrors the performance of the S&P 500 index.</p>
            <p>As a trader, if I want to buy and hold shares of the S&P 500, one of the vehicles I can do this through is the ETF with the stock symbol: SPY (again, it’s often pronounced as S.P.Y. or spy). It’s a low-cost way to get exposure to the entire stock market. Another benefit of SPY that I didn’t discover until later in my career is that it can handle “size.” Meaning you won’t have to adjust your approach once you start trading with a six- or seven-figure account.</p>
            <p>SPY is also not actively managed, meaning no one is trying to pick stock winners each year. The stocks in the ETF either meet the criteria or they don’t. If a company in the index fails, it’s replaced with another winner. I love it! Someone passively manages it for me and ensures I only invest in the winning companies that pass a strict criterion.</p>
            <p>Also, broad-based ETFs like SPY are more diversified and have less risk and volatility than individual stocks. This stability helps my performance be more consistent and predictable. A stock can drop 20% in one day. It’s much rarer to see the S&P 500 or the exchange-traded fund (SPY) drop that much in one day. At most, they may drop 5%. So those are a few reasons I only use SPY for this blueprint. Now let me share the rules I follow for the call option portion of the enhanced buy & hold portfolio</p>
            <h3>MY RULES FOR THE BUFFETT CALL OPTION</h3>
            <p>The Buffett call is a simple trade I place once a year, and it takes 10 minutes to set up. It’s a random entry trade, meaning I can set this up anytime and in any market environment. No market timing is involved, and I don’t even have to look at a stock chart to place the trade.</p>
            <p>I only buy LEAPS® or long-term options. They are options with expirations longer than a year. They are also called ‘Long-Term Equity Anticipation Securities.’</p>
            <p>I choose the farthest-dated December expiration available. It’s usually two to three years out in time.</p>
            <p>I buy the call with a strike price at, or up to 10% higher than the stock price.</p>
            <p>I risk or invest roughly 10 to 20% of my total account value into the calls, but ultimately, it depends on how many stock shares I own.</p>
            <p>Regardless of when I open my first call trade, I do an annual reset/rebalance of my portfolio at the end of the current year or the beginning of the following year. Resetting means I sell my old call options and buy a new set following the above rules. I then rinse and repeat every year, but I hold my call options for a little over a year for tax reasons.</p>
            <p>Please note: Once you review the enhanced buy & hold case study, you will see these rules in action, and they will make more sense.</p>
            <h3>My Call Management Rules</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>There is zero management of the trade during the year. I set it up and leave it alone. I only manage it when it’s time to do my portfolio’s annual reset/rebalance.</li>
              <li>I’ve never experienced a series of back-to-back LEAP call losses, but if I did, I’d either quit the strategy or replenish the account with more cash to start over.</li>
              <li>In regard to the EBH portfolio, I never ‘exercise’ the rights of my call option contract. Meaning I never use the call option to buy the stock. I only buy the calls for the leveraged return they provide (more on this in a bit).</li>
              <li>I buy the longer-dated options because they are less affected by time decay and cheaper on an average cost basis. I reset every year for three primary reasons:
                <ol>
                  <li>To capture any profit I may have before the market takes it away from me.</li>
                  <li>So that rapid time decay of the option is never a concern for me, and . . .</li>
                  <li>It allows me to rebalance my portfolio, so my allocations don’t get out of whack.</li>
                </ol>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Please note: In my taxable account, I wait for a year to pass before I manage my options positions. This helps me take advantage of the lower tax rates for long-term capital gains. In my tax-advantaged retirement accounts, this is not a concern.</p>
            <p>Now if all of the above rules made sense to you, good; you understand options. However, if the above sounded like a foreign language to you, no worries; it’s a typical experience for beginners.</p>
            <p>Options are a foreign concept to many. They are simple in principle but challenging to understand at first. I was dazed and confused for about six months when I started learning about options. I honestly felt stupid and wondered if others were as confused as I was. However, my mentor made millions with options, so I was determined to master this topic. Over time, as you continue to study, things will slowly start to make sense. Just be patient with yourself.</p>
            <p>When you profit and earn returns that people think are too good to be true, you’ll be glad you decided not to give up. Regarding returns, let’s examine the pros and cons of using call options in various market conditions.</p>
                   <h3>HOW CALLS WORK IN BULL AND BEAR
                    MARKETS</h3>     


                    <p>For reference, a bull market means stocks are consistently rising in price over a long period of time. And a bear market is when stocks consistently fall in price over a long period.</p>
<p>The trade below was covered previously, but since this chapter is about calls, I want to show it again, so you can see that calls are both good and bad depending on how the market behaves. I’ll also compare the overall performance of the call options to buy & hold.</p>
<p><strong>Round One: January 14, 2021 to January 18, 2022</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>The ETF SPY rises in price from $378.46 to $456.49, a 20.6% gain.</li>
  <li>The December 2023, 380 call option rises in price from $48.77 to $104.29, a 113.8% gain.</li>
</ul>
<p>I want to focus on the 113.8% gain, which is why we buy call options. This high return seems too good to be true until you realize it always happens in real estate. Buying options, as well as purchasing investment property, give us leverage. Leverage is just a fancy way of describing a method of buying something big for very little money. You pay a small deposit or premium upfront, then you get to control one hundred percent of the asset.</p>
<p>Again, with call options, we will never ‘exercise’ the rights of our option contracts so we can buy the stock. We only purchase the calls for the leveraged return they provide. Think real estate investing; it allows you to build wealth without buying the house for personal use. You only put down a small amount of money, but you have access to and can benefit from the asset going up in value. You are buying the house as an investment because of the leverage it can provide. You never intend to own it for personal use.</p>
<p>Now back to options . . .</p>
<p>The above call option gives us the right to buy 100 shares of SPY @ $380, and we paid $4,877 for this, right. We control $38,000 worth of stock for a fraction of the cost of buying 100 shares.</p>
<p>During the year, the stock rose in price from $378.46 to $456.49. A $78 increase in price, or a 20% gain in one year. If we wanted to capture the profit, we could exercise the rights of the call, buy the stock, and then sell it for a profit. Of course, we’d need $38,000 to do that. However, there is a cheaper alternative to capturing the profit. You sell the option contract to capture your profit.</p>
<p>We own a contract that says we can buy a $456 asset for only $378. Do you think that contract is now more valuable than the $4K we paid? Yes, it is, and the higher the stock rises, the more valuable the call contract becomes. Depending on which option you buy, it often moves almost dollar for dollar with the stock price. So that call option you purchased would also increase in price close to the $78 the stock increased in price. You saw this with the call we bought. It grew in price from $48.77 to $104.29. That’s a $55.52 gain, but since we only have to put up $48.77, the gain equals a 113.8% return on our money.</p>
<p>If you’re lost on the math, no worries; the main goal is to show you that we can use calls to make big profits. Then we can sell the option to capture the gain without coughing up thousands of dollars to buy the stock. It’s an example of the leverage of options. A small amount of money controls and benefits from a bigger asset. That’s one of two reasons we buy these calls.</p>
<p>The second reason will be revealed in the next chapter.</p>
<p>People keep saying that trading options is risky, but we are doing what real estate investors have done for years. We are investing small amounts of money to control and benefit from a large asset. In the case of call options, the asset is stock shares. Now let’s do an option reset (buy new options with a farther-dated expiration) and then see what happens when the asset drops in price.</p>
<p><strong>Round Two: January 18, 2022 to January 19, 2023</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>SPY stock declines in price from $456.49 to $388.64, a -14.9% loss.</li>
  <li>The December 2024, 460 call option declines in price from $65.50 to $21, a -67.9% loss.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, call options do great when the market goes up. But when the market falls, calls get destroyed. That’s leverage in reverse.</p>

<p><strong>Call Option Summary</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Call options allow you to make (or lose) money from stock price movement without buying stocks.</li>
  <li>The average buy & return over the two years was a positive 2.85%.</li>
  <li>The average call option return over the two years was a positive 24.45%.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even with the massive loss, the average call option return is still ahead percentagewise compared to buy & hold. However, options are leveraged investing vehicles, so it’s unfair to compare them to buy & hold directly. That’s the mistake I and many others have made before. We look at the numbers and make decisions based on the numbers. However, the real world is not lived inside of a spreadsheet. Don’t make the mistake of removing the emotional factor from the numbers.</p>
<p>Chasing after the high returns without considering the impact it will have on your emotions is a catastrophic mistake. Logically, people will choose to earn a 24% return over a 2% return, but that comparison is made based on greed. If you haven’t heard, being a greedy investor will eventually cause you to go broke.</p>
<p>Here is my blunt warning: Call options can give you super performance but can also cause you to lose ALL your money!</p>
<p>Also, the above-average numbers don’t factor in the worst-case scenario. For example, the option contract lost 67.9% of its value in one year. What if the market went down for three years straight like it did from 2000–2002? You’d lose on buy & hold, but not 100% of your money, and you could also wait until the SPY stock shares recovered in price since the shares don’t have an expiration date.</p>
<p>With the call option, however, you’d lose 100% of your investment due to leverage working in reverse. Also, the option has an expiration date. It disappears and ceases to exist after a certain amount of time. If you don’t make money during the call options shelf life, you lose 100% of your investment due to time decay. The thought of losing 100% of your investment should scare you!</p>
<p>Of course, since we only allocate a small portion of our account to calls, a 100% loss would only put about a 10% dent in our overall account. Knowing exactly how much damage can happen to my account is more comforting than having 100% of my money at the mercy of the whims of buy & hold. Regardless, you should be careful with buying call options. If misused, they can be financially devastating. I’ll share a real-life example of that next.</p>
