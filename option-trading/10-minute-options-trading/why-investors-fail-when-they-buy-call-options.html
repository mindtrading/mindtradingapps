         <h3>WHY INVESTORS FAIL WHEN THEY BUY CALL
            OPTIONS</h3>
            <p>If you study options trading for any length of time, you will stumble across experts who will tell you not to ‘buy’ options but instead ‘sell’ them. Then they will spread lies and misinformation about how buying options doesn’t work. They may mean well, but they are wrong, and if you listen to them, you won’t achieve the results profiled in this book. Also, remember the earlier lesson about being an either-or thinker? Don’t think of option buying versus option selling. Think both. Learn both methods as I did, implement the best of each approach, and get the best of both worlds.</p>
            <p>Now let me share two common reasons why investors fail when buying options: time in the trade and emotions.</p>
            <p>Do you want to increase your chances of having success with buying options? If so, buy LEAP or long-term options, not short-term ones. Most people new to options trading will buy options that expire in three months or less, mainly because they are cheaper. However, predicting what the stock market will do in three months is nearly impossible. Thus, with LEAP options, we avoid having to predict. Instead, we model successful buy & hold investors and focus on the stock market’s long-term trend.</p>
            <p>Second, let’s talk about emotions. My experience as a coach has taught me that the one variable that prevents most from achieving stock market success is emotions. It’s the number one profit killer!</p>
            <p>Emotions manifest themselves in several ways, but the two most common are fear and greed. More specifically, the greed of wanting more and wanting it quickly and the fear of losing what we have or losing more of what we have. Greed often causes people to invest more aggressively, and they lose the money they make. And fear often prevents people from actually investing, or if they do, they don’t take the necessary risk to grow the account.</p>
            <p>Here is an example of how this plays out in real life . . .</p>
            <p>In 2019, I was trading with a group of investors, and we were using the Buffett call option. The stock market was raging higher, and we were achieving profits that experts would say were too good to be true. More specifically, we doubled our money on those call positions every four to six months.</p>
            <p>Making that much money so fast caused one of the traders in the group to get greedy. Thus in 2020, coming off the previous year’s profit high, this investor increased their call allocation to 50% of their account. If you read my earlier book, Options Trading Made Simple, you already know how I feel about this; it’s dumb! Anyone who does this doesn’t appreciate their money and will soon lose it. Money only stays with and gravitates toward people who steward it properly.</p>
            <p>Preaching aside, the market crashed in March of 2020, and that investor lost so much money on those calls that they freaked out and closed them. What about the rest of the group? Since we only had 10–20% of our account allocated to those calls, we could withstand the terror of the rapid decline. At the end of 2020, when the market finally recovered, we cashed out our positions for over a 100% gain.</p>
            <p>So, we made money, but greed caused one investor in the group to lose nearly 40% of the value of their account. Fear is a cousin of greed, so let’s see how fear infects investors’ minds.</p>
            <p>At the beginning of 2021, when it was time to buy a new set of Buffett calls, do you think this wayward investor joined us? Think about it, we used the same ‘strategy’ but had vastly different results because of emotions. One investor lost roughly 40% of their account, and the rest of us were able to double our money. I think you know the answer. This investor did not join us in 2021 because they were too scared.</p>
            <p>Near the end of 2021, when we were cashing out yet another gain, I checked in with this investor to see if they were celebrating with us. I was disheartened to hear they didn’t even buy any new calls. When I asked why, they said they didn’t trust the market. They thought it might fall again because we were still in a pandemic. They didn’t want to lose any more money. That’s fear on display.</p>
            <p>So, there you go! That was a real-life example of how fear and greed rear its ugly head in an investor’s life. Strategies are rarely ever the real issue holding you back financially. It’s usually our flawed human nature that gets in the way.</p>
            <p>Lastly, after years of buying call options, I learned how to benefit from calls without going broke because of their downfalls. There are two ways I achieve this, 1) I invest a small amount of my account in call options, or 2) I balance the risk of calls with put options (or puts for short). Puts are what we will cover in the next chapter. See you there.</p>
