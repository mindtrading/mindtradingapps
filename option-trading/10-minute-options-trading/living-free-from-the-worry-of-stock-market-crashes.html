         <h3>LIVING FREE FROM THE WORRY OF STOCK
            MARKET CRASHES</h3>
            <p>I don’t know Mr. Buffett personally, but I have read that he has a similar emotional temperament to me regarding money. We don’t get bothered by investment losses. But then again, maybe it’s because we are following a plan and know the statistical probability of it working out. We are investing with logic, not emotions. Regardless, the above quote is rather blunt and can make people feel like they shouldn’t invest if they feel normal emotions.</p>
            <p>I’m a unique individual; I get that. Said another way, I’m not normal. My wife agrees. Most normal people would panic watching their account decline by 50%, and I don’t blame you. It’s scary, especially since losses happen more quickly than gains. You could have spent 20 years saving that money, and if half of it disappeared in a year, it would be terrifying.</p>
            <p>The good news is that the tool discussed in this chapter was created to protect you against such events. It will give you peace of mind and was designed to ensure you don’t have those 50% declines in your account. This tool allows you to live free from the worry of market crashes, and it’s the secret to why my clients don’t panic during market declines.</p>
            <p>Even the billionaire investor, Mark Cuban, used it to protect 1.4 billion in stock he received when he sold his company (Mohamed, 2020). The tool is called a protective put option, or ‘stock insurance’ as I often call it.</p>
            <p>Strictly speaking, there is no such thing as stock insurance. However, put options were created as a form of insurance, and this is arguably, one of the most important aspects of the enhanced buy & hold blueprint.</p>
            <h3>PUT OPTION BASICS</h3>
            <p>Again, options are relatively unknown to most stock market investors and are considered risky. Ironically, options were created to protect investors from risk. In the case of put options, they were created so investors could buy insurance for their stock investments to prevent losing large sums of money. Put option contracts are the opposite of call options, but they still have some of the same standardized features.</p>
            <p>A person who buys one put option has the right, but not the obligation, to sell 100 shares of stock, at a set price, on or before a specific date.</p>
            <p>Again, options are contracts between two parties. So if you exercised your rights, the seller of the put would be obligated to buy the shares you wanted to sell.</p>
            <p>When the rights of the option contract are exercised, the price the stock can be sold at is the option’s strike price.</p>
            <p>Since you are buying an insurance contract, you have to pay a small fee known as the premium. Option premiums, or prices, are always listed as small numbers, but since the option contract controls 100 shares of stock, you have to multiply the premium by 100 to get the true cost of buying the option.</p>
            <p>The contract also has an expiration date and is only valid for a certain period of time.</p>
            <p>Because of the limited shelf life, the options suffer from a concept called time decay. A small portion of the option’s value is lost each day that passes.</p>
            <p>To buy put options, you’ll need the same brokerage account permissions as you do with buying call options.</p>
            <p>Now let’s revisit the hypothetical example from the previous chapter, but this time it will be in reverse because, again, put option benefits are the opposite of call option benefits. Call options allow an investor to place a small bet on a stock’s price movement without coughing up thousands of dollars. With a protective put, however, the investor has already purchased the stock and wants to insure their investment.</p>
            <p>Let’s say an investor buys 100 shares of stock XYZ @ $160 a share price. It would cost $16,000. If the stock went up in price, they would make money. However, if the stock falls in price, they could lose all $16,000. Investors who are nervous about losing so much money could buy insurance. They could buy a three-year 160 strike put option on stock XYZ for $10 (or $1,000). Because of the rights of the put contract, it will increase in value as the stock falls in price (and vice versa).</p>
            <p>Suppose the investor gets lucky, and the stock increases to $190. In this case, the protective put was unnecessary, and the investor lost the $1,000 paid for the insurance. I consider that a small price to pay for the peace of mind of being fully insured.</p>
            <p>However, suppose the company runs into trouble, and the stock decreases in price to $80 a share, or a 50% decline. The investor could exercise their rights of the put contract and sell the stock for $160. Yup, even though the stock has fallen by 50%, the investor can sell it for the same price they bought it for. The only money the investor lost was the $1,000 it cost to buy the put insurance. That’s much less than the $8,000 they would have lost if they didn’t have stock insurance.</p>
            <p>And just like with calls, if the stock went nowhere in price, the investor would lose the $1,000 paid for the put option due to time decay. Please note: Puts are only helpful when stocks fall in price.</p>
            <p>In summary, protective put options allow investors to insure their stock purchases like people buy homes and insure them. After all, if you invest hundreds of thousands of dollars to buy an asset, you might as well pay a small premium to have complete protection against a massive loss.</p>
            <p>Something I wish someone would have told Betty to do. It’s a sad story that we will cover in the next chapter. It illustrates why I’m such a big proponent of buying put options. Now, let’s discuss the rules I follow for the put option portion of the enhanced buy & hold portfolio.</p>
          
            <h3>MY RULES FOR THE PROTECTIVE PUT OPTION (AKA STOCK INSURANCE)</h3>
            <p>I have good news. The rules for my puts are the same as the call options. Here they are again, so you don’t have to revisit the previous chapter:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Buying a protective put is a simple trade I place once a year, and it takes 10 minutes to set up. It’s a random entry trade, meaning I can set this up anytime and in any market environment. There is no market timing involved, and I always buy my protective put options at the same time I buy my call options.</li>
              <li>I only buy LEAPS® or long-term options. They are options with expirations longer than a year. They are also called ‘Long-Term Equity Anticipation Securities.’</li>
              <li>I choose the farthest-dated December expiration available. It’s usually two to three years out in time.</li>
              <li>I buy the put that has a strike price at, or up to 10% higher than the stock price.</li>
              <li>I risk or invest roughly 10 to 20% of my total account value into the puts, but ultimately, it depends on how many stock shares I own.</li>
              <li>Regardless of when I open my first put trade, I will sell it at the end of the current year or the beginning of the following year, and then I will buy a new put following the above rules. This is the annual reset/rebalance of my portfolio. I hold this next put for a little over a year and then sell it. Afterward, I rinse and repeat every single year. And again, you will see these rules in action during the enhanced buy & hold case study.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>My Put Management Rules</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>There is zero management of the trade during the year. I set it up and leave it alone. I only manage it when it’s time to do the annual reset/rebalance of the portfolio.</li>
              <li>With protective puts, I expect and am okay with a series of back-to-back LEAP put losses. If that happens, it means the market did not crash, and that’s ultimately what I want.</li>
              <li>In regard to the EBH portfolio, I never ‘exercise’ the rights of my put option contract to sell the stock. I only buy the puts for peace of mind and to offset any losses I experience during market crashes.</li>
              <li>I buy the longer-dated options because they are less affected by time decay and cheaper on an average cost basis. I reset every year for three primary reasons:
                <ol type="1">
                  <li>The stock market goes up more than it goes down, so if I ever have profit on my puts, I want to capture it before the market goes back up in price.</li>
                  <li>I don’t want rapid time decay of the option ever to be a concern for me. And . . .</li>
                  <li>It allows me to rebalance my portfolio, so my allocations don’t get out of whack.</li>
                </ol>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Please note: In my taxable account, I wait for a year to pass before I manage my options positions. This helps me take advantage of the lower tax rates for long-term capital gains. In my tax-advantaged retirement accounts, this is not a concern.</p>
            <h3>HOW PUTS WORK IN BULL AND BEAR MARKETS</h3>
            <p>For the EBH portfolio, I am not ‘trading’ puts. This means I am not trying to time the market and profit from declining stocks. The purpose of puts in the EBH portfolio is to replace the need for bonds. Meaning their sole purpose is to stabilize my portfolio during market declines. The downfall is that the puts drag down my overall performance in up markets. I can live with this tradeoff because protective puts make money in down markets, which helps stabilize my emotions during market crashes.</p>
            <p>For example, during the market decline of 2020, the stock market fell nearly 30% in just a few weeks. It freaked so many people out that they panic-sold their stocks. Not my clients, though; they all had put options in place. Here is a note I received from one of them:</p>
            <p>It’s excellent receiving notes like this but getting folks on board with the concept of buying puts for insurance was a painful process. It took much convincing, and even once they bought the puts, they would constantly complain. Why? Because people hate buying something that constantly loses money. You’ll see what I mean in the following examples. We’ll use the 2021 to 2023 case study profiled in the call option chapter.</p>
            <p>Round one: January 14, 2021 to January 18, 2022</p>
            <ul>
            <li>SPY stock rises in price from $378.46 to $456.49, a 20.6% gain.</li>
            <li>The December 2023, 380 put option declines in price from $59.35 to $28.18, a -52.5% loss.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>As you can see, it sucks to own put options when the market goes up. And guess what? The market goes up more than down, so I usually lose money on the puts in my accounts. However, during the rare times the market does fall, the puts give me comfort because it feels good seeing something make money in my account during market declines.</p>
            <p>Before we move on, let me answer one of the most common questions I get: “Travis, since the puts lose so much money in up markets, can’t we wait until the market falls to buy them?” Sure, that’s a great plan, in theory, but let me ask you this. Can you predict when you will get in a car accident, so you wait to buy insurance before that happens? It seems silly when you think about it that way. Put options are disaster insurance, and since we can’t predict when the market will fall, it’s best to have them in place at all times. Now let’s see how puts behave in down markets.</p>
            <p>Round two: January 18, 2022 to January 19, 2023</p>
            <ul>
            <li>SPY stock declines in price from $456.49 to $388.64, a -14.9% loss.</li>
            <li>The December 2024, 460 put option increases in price from $64.50 to $74, a 14.7% gain.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>So in a down market, puts make money and provide peace of mind. However, put options are not a perfect solution, and their gain usually doesn’t cover 100% of the losses you experience on your stock shares. This is another thing clients struggle with. They expect to see the puts offset their losses on a dollar-for-dollar basis, which is usually not the case.</p>
            <p>The real benefits of puts are only seen in severe crashes of 30–50%, but that’s also when they are most needed. Those are the emotionally triggering kinds of declines that are impossible to predict. Thus, it’s best to always have protective puts in place just in case of a severe crash. Just like it’s best to have homeowners’ insurance just in case your house catches on fire.</p>
            <p>Regardless of if your puts fully recoup the loss you take on the stock, it’s nice to have them in place for the peace of mind factor. That benefit alone is priceless, and it’s hard to put a value on it. As a coach, I have noticed that the investors who own protective puts are less emotionally reactive to stocks falling in price. They don’t freak out and sell their stocks because they have fallen in price. That said, let’s wrap this up with a summary.</p>
           
           <h3>Put Option Summary</h3>
            <ul><li>The average buy & return over the two years was a positive 2.85%.</li> 
               <li> The average put option return over the two years was a negative 18.9%. </li>
                
                </ul>
                So yes, puts costs money and hinders your portfolio’s performance, but come on, isn’t the peace of mind and market crash protection worth it? If you’re shaking your head, no, I understand. I’ve been coaching for nearly two decades and have not met a client who was ‘okay’ with less-than-average returns. Thus, I had to teach them the solution to this problem. We discussed it in the previous chapter; it’s call options. Do you recall me stating that I balance the risk of call options with put options?</p>
           
            <p>Here is what I mean. If you take the average call option performance from the last chapter (+24.45%) and subtract it from the average put performance we just discussed (-18.9%), you get a positive 5.55%.</p>
            <p>So again, the puts drag down your performance, but success with investing is more than just about making the most money. It’s also about what’s best for you emotionally. Emotions are what cause people to underperform and encounter losses. Studies have proven that you will do better if you hold stocks and don’t sell during down periods (Stevens, 2021). However, people still sell despite overwhelming data that it’s a bad idea to sell. Why? Emotions.</p>
            <p>Emotions are more influential than logic. Thus, we are trying to create a system to bypass our emotional triggers. Emotions can also blind people to beautiful truths right in front of their faces. For example, most people always point out that they could make more money if they didn’t own the puts. However, even with the put dragging down the performance, you still would have earned a positive 5.55% return.</p>
            <p>With that return, you still beat the average buy & return of 2.85% during the same period, but you also got the best of both worlds. You achieved a bit of super performance, but you were also protected from market crashes. The subdued put + call return means you never make so much that it causes you to be greedy, and you also never lose so much that it causes you to panic. It’s truly a genius system that I was blessed to stumble across.</p>
                                          
            <p>Now that we have covered put options, let me share the structure of enhanced buy & hold (or EBH for short). The EBH portfolio is comprised of the following:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Call options for super performance AND to pay for the puts.</li>
              <li>Traditional buy & hold, i.e., passive index fund/ETF investing for long-term passive wealth building. And . . .</li>
              <li>Put options for market crash protection and peace of mind.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>It’s a relatively simple setup, but don’t let the simplicity fool you. Too often, people make investing unnecessarily complicated, believing that complexity equals profit. Sometimes, success means making things so simple that you can’t help but succeed. For example, using the results of the mini case studies, let’s see how powerful this simple setup is:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The average call option performance from the last chapter (+24.45%).</li>
              <li>The average buy & hold return (+2.85%). And . . .</li>
              <li>This chapter’s average put option performance (-18.9%).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you combine all three returns, the average return is 8.4%, nearly three times the return of the pure buy & hold approach. So, in my not-so-humble opinion, you just discovered how to rapidly build wealth while living free from the worry of market crashes. Of course, we don’t invest our entire account in options, but you can see how the options boost our account. It enhances our performance. Before we move on, I want to be clear about something . . .</p>
            <p>Enhanced buy & hold is not a magic pill or a quick path to riches. It does require study and practice on your end. It’s an approach designed to empower you to build wealth using professional tools, strategies, and guidance. It’s a simple blueprint, but it’s certainly not easy. When you first learn it, it can seem overwhelming and complicated. However, you’ll see it’s a simple set-it-and-forget-it system once you push through the initial nervousness and discomfort. For most clients, the hardest part is managing their emotions of fear and greed. In my experience, success with money is 80% mental and 20% technical know-how. And in the next chapter, you’ll see a tragic example of how emotions can be the number one profit killer for investors.</p>
