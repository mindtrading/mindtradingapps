         <h3>A Sound Strategy for a Beginner</h3>
         <p>One of the fundamental challenges of teaching options trading to beginners
            is that there are many pitfalls, and if you just go into the market guns
            blazing, you will likely come up short. Many gurus and authors have thus
            turned their attentions to the search for good, simple, conservative trading
            strategies for beginner-level traders. Ideally, you will use these simple
            strategies to get a feel for options trading and to steadily learn more and
            more about the details, metrics, and more complex strategies that may come
            into play if you continue to trade.
            </p>
            <h3>Selling the Covered Call</h3>
            <p>Several authors and experts, among them Michael Sincere, author of
                Understanding Options, has argued that the selling of the covered call is
                one of the best ways to christen your options trading journey6
                . Similar
                sentiment has been echoed by stocktrader.com in their published list of 6
                Great Options Strategies for Beginners. The covered call is at the top of
                their list7
                . It is the opinion of this author that the gurus aren’t promoting
                covered calls for beginners because they represent a somehow uniquely
                simple form of options trading, but instead, because they are a highly
                palatable way of introducing options into your general trading affairs.
                </p>
                <p>Here’s why: as you may recall from Chapter 2, when you sell a call (any
                    call), you’re guaranteeing another party the right to purchase a stock at an
                    agreed-upon price –the strike price—before an agreed-upon period of time
                    has expired. What makes the sale of the call “covered” is your ownership of
                    the stock—known as the “underlying asset”—for which you are selling the
                    call. In the example in Chapter 2, you sold a call option for Disney stock,
                    and you did so because you owned Disney and selling your Disney Stock
                    was already part of your larger strategy.
                    </p>
                    <p>For options beginners, get your feet wet by choosing a stock that you
                        already own (100 shares, preferably) and are looking to unload. Hence, a
                        covered call can provide you an opportunity to make some money before
                        you eventually sell off the stock. In the fictitious Disney example from
                        Chapter 2, you sold a covered call option for 100 shares of Disney at a $120
                        strike price—short one DIS Nov 120 call—for $5 per share, a grand total of
                        $500. Now, for the first-time options trader, the worst case scenario is that
                        the price of Disney skyrockets and you miss out on a big return from the
                        normal sale of the stock, as you’re forced to sell it off at $120 per share to
                        the owner of the call. That said, you’re already going into the transaction
                        with an intention to unload the Disney stock at a price that you, at least at
                        the time, think is reasonable. Therefore, if you stick to covered calls for
                        your first several option trades, you’ll be able to directly set limits for your
                        losses, meanwhile, you’ll learn more about options trading and will be able
                        to more comfortably integrate options into your overall investment strategy.</p>
                        <p>Ideally, selling covered calls on stocks you want to sell anyway will
                            culminate in a cash influx. When you sell a covered call you will, of course,
                            get paid for it. This payment is known as a “premium.” In the Disney
                            example, the premium for selling the call option was $500. If the option is
                            never exercised, then the seller pockets the premium, keeps the stock, and is
                            free to put another covered call out onto the market and pocket another
                            premium. This can be a great way to keep your stocks generating income
                            for you, even as you’re preparing to part ways with them.

                            <h3>Dumping DuPont</h3>
                            <p>Let’s say you’re brand new to options and ready to sell your DuPont™
                                Stock (DFT). Meanwhile, you’d like to make some money on your way out
                                of the stock and maybe try your hand at options trading. Let’s first take a
                                look at the <strong>options chain:</strong> </p>
                                <p><img src="img/8.webp"/></p>
                                <p>As you can see, there’s a drop down menu just below the quoted price
                                    that allows you to select an expiration date for your call option. Since
                                    you’re accessing the options chain on December 16, 2015, go ahead and
                                    pull up available contracts with an expiration date of April 15, 2016, about
                                    four months away. Your objective is sell a call option contract (100 shares)
                                    for your DuPont shares. How do you use information found in the option
                                    chain to determine your sale price?</p>
                    <p>If you don’t already know what bid prices and ask prices are, then it’s
                        definitely time to learn. These prices determine how much it’s going to cost
                        to buy or sell your options. Since you’re selling, the bid price for a
                        particular option represents what’s immediately available to you. Look at
                        the chart in Fg. 8. Specifically take a look at the April 15th option contract
                        with the $35 strike price. As you can see, there’s an ask price of $.70 and a
                        bid price of $.25. This means that some party is prepared to immediately
                        pay 25 cents per share to own this call option contract. There is also a party
                        willing to sell this call option for $.70 per share. What does this tell you?
                        Well, for starters, that’s a bit of a wide spread for such an inexpensive
                        option—we’ll talk more about that later. But, long story short, if you want
                        to guarantee your sale of the call option, then you can do so by accepting
                        the bid price of $.25 and selling your covered call (100 shares worth) for a
                        total of $25. Seems a little skimpy, huh? If you’re just starting in options
                        trading, and especially if you’re looking at smaller spreads (the difference
                        between the bid and the ask prices), then you may want to go ahead and sell
                        your covered call at the bid price to ensure that you’re trade is filled. If
                        you’re already familiar with exploiting the wiggle room between bids and
                        ask prices, then you may want to jump right in with a limit order, in which
                        you agree to purchase a certain financial asset (stocks, options, etc.) at or
                        below a certain price. For example, you could instruct your broker to “sell
                        one April DFT call at $.50 or better.
                        8” If you’ve been wondering, what the
                        “one” means in option lingo, it refers to the buying or selling of “one”
                        options contract (100 shares). If you sell two April DFT call at $.50 or
                        better, then you’re selling two contracts (200 shares), and you’ll be paid
                        $100 for the trade rather than $50, assuming your limit order is filled.
                        </p>
                <p>If you’re still having trouble getting your head around the concept of asks
                    and bids, then imagine your brokerage as an import business, like Pier 1,
                    that ships all of its products from South East Asia. There’s a particular cost
                    to the business for each product because of the transportation expense and
                    the cost of manufacturing the product. There’s also a particular retail price.
                    The import business owner is not going to want to sell you one of her
                    products at cost, because she won’t make any profit whatsoever. She’d
                    prefer that you just pay retail price, but that doesn’t mean that she’d be
                    unwilling to unload the product if you were interested in paying somewhere
                    between the product cost and the retail price. Bottom line, flexibility is
                    available, but there’s no guarantee that your negotiations will be fruitful.</p>
                    <h3>In the Money (ITM) or Out of the Money (OTM)</h3>
                    <p>Notice in your attempts to sell your covered call for DFT that you’re
                        paying particular attention to the bottom most call contract, the one with the
                        strike price of $35. You may also notice the little blue marker that Yahoo
                        business uses to denote contracts that are currently In The Money (ITM). If
                        an option is ITM, it means that exercising the option immediately will yield
                        a profit. That is, of course, if you don’t take into account the cost of
                        acquiring the option to begin with.
                        </p>
                        <p>In Fg. 8 the topmost call contract is ITM and the bottom most, the one
                            you’re looking at with the strike price of $35, is OTM. The $30 DFT call
                            contract has a strike price ($30), which is less than the value of the stock.
                            Therefore, if the owner of said option immediately called in the stock at
                            $30, she’d be making a profit of $2.18 per share. That said, a price was paid
                            to obtain the option. If that price was more than $2.18 per share, then there
                            was actually no net profit made, even though the call option was ITM.
                            Therefore, if an option is ITM, it’s going to increase in price, and if the
                            option is OTM, then the option will lower in price. Now, it’s important to
                            understand that the parameters of OTM and ITM change with the type of
                            option being considered. Let’s take a look at the put options on the market
                            for April 15th for DuPont. See Fg. 9 below.</p>
                            <p><img src="img/9.webp"/></p>
                            <p>Notice that the baby blue “ITM” highlight is used to denote the put
                                option with the strike price of $35. This is because for put options, which
                                represent a guaranteed right to “put” or sell stock back to the market, the
                                strike price must be higher than the stock value in order for a profit to be
                                realized. In Fg. 9, the put option that’s ITM has a strike price of $35 and
                                bid-ask spread of $4.10-$4.70. The per share profit realized from
                                immediately exercising this put option is $2.82 ($35-$32.18), which, of
                                course, is offset by the price of purchasing the option. In order for any
                                option (ITM or OTM) to be truly profitable for a buyer, the stock price
                                (and/or the option price) must always move in the right direction within the
                                allotted time. In other words, the direct profit obtained by calling in the
                                stock or putting it on the market must be greater than the price you paid to
                                obtain the option.
                                </p>
                                <p><img src="img/10.webp"/></p>
                                <p>When you’re just starting out with options trading and selling a covered
                                    call, it’s better if you choose a contract with a strike price that’s slightly out
                                    of the money. Your thinking should be something akin to the following:
                                    ‘I’ve got 100 shares of DKT, currently valued at $32.18, that I’m looking to
                                    unload. I’d be happy to sell it off at $35 a share, so I’m going to let the
                                    stock work for me in the meantime—I’m going to sell a call option with a
                                    $35 strike price. I’ll make some money in the short term, and I’ll only have
                                    to sell my stock if it goes up to $35 or higher by the end of the expiration
                                    period. If the call option expires without ever being redeemed, then I’ll just
                                    issue a new one and continue to generate more money from the premiums
                                    received. I’ll keep track of how much money my stock has generated, as
                                    this is going to lower my cost basis for the stock, and ideally, make my
                                    overall involvement with DFT a more profitable and successful endeavor.’

                                    <h3>Disclaimer</h3>
                                    <p>Keep in mind that when we advocate selling the covered call option as a
                                        conservative play for a beginner, we’re doing so because the strategy is easy
                                        to understand and can be easily fit into a greater investment strategy. We’re
                                        not implying that this strategy is more likely than others to turn a profit or
                                        minimize risk. In his book, Options for the Beginner and Beyond, author
                                        and trader, Edward Olmstead, provides a reality check for the covered call
                                        trade strategy and issues the following caveats:
                                        </p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Olmstead advises monitoring the value of the underlying asset, the stock,
                                                more closely than the value of the option. Just because you’ve sold a
                                                covered option on the stock does not oblige you to keep it if it falls too
                                                low10.</li>
                                                <li>Olmstead also warns against getting too greedy and impulsively buying
                                                    back your call option in the event that the stock shoots up, “Avoid buying
                                                    back the option for a loss unless you have a good reason to do so.” If the
                                                    stock goes up, you still made a profit. Maybe it’s not as large as it might

               <h3>Avoid These Beginner Mistakes</h3>
               <p>Everyone makes mistakes with their investments, whether you’re trading
                stocks and options, buying gold and silver, or purchasing real estate. A
                good pre-investing education, can help you avoid some of the common
                pitfalls that claim beginning options investors and send them running for
                the hills.<br><br>
                Consider these:</p>
                <h4>Plan to work & work your plan</h4>
                <p>You should always enter options deals with a plan, most specifically an exit
                    plan. Many of us make a definitive exit plan only to get caught up in the
                    moment and change it. Choose your upside and downside exit points in
           advance and adhere to those decisions. Don’t wait around because you think
           a stock is going to soar through the roof and you’ll make even more. The
           converse is true as well. Don’t ditch your exit strategy in hopes that a stock
           will come up and you’ll recoup more of your losses. It’s easy to let your
           emotions get the best of you during trading, especially with your money at
           risk, but you need to put those emotions aside as best you can. That doesn’t
           mean, of course, that you can’t reassess your plan at all. You just don’t want
           to do it in the middle of a trade.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Don’t buy it because it’s cheap</h4>
                    <p>Do you know someone who heads to the supermarket with stacks of
           coupons, buying everything with these cents-off offers whether they need
           the items or not? Well, some traders operate that way, too. Brokers warn
           new options traders about the temptation to buy deeply out-of-the-money
           options just because they’re cheap. This is especially true of those working
           with limited funds. If an option is very far out-of-the-money, it has a long
           way to move before it becomes profitable. Hence, it’s often a better idea to
           start with options that cost more and are more in-the-money and have an
           expiration date that’s further out. Ultimately, the reward may not be as
           large, but the risk will certainly be lower.
           </p>
           <h4>Remember that losses are a fact of life</h4>
                        <p>You can’t avoid losses altogether when you’re dealing with options trading,
                            so don’t fear losses. Losses happen, but you just need to learn how to keep
              them as small as possible. Inevitably you’ll suffer a few sizeable ones as
              well, but you can’t let that scare you away from the market. Don’t just think
              about your trades in the context of whether or not they make money for
              your portfolio, but think of whether they are in line with your own rules for
              trading. That in itself constitutes success. Then accept the fact that you can’t
              control the market.</p>
              <h4>Be disciplined in your trading</h4>
              <p>Think about these things before you make any trade: 1) What is a
                  reasonable amount of money for this trade? 2) What entry and exit signals
                                do I need to identify? 3) What is the maximum risk I’m willing to assume
                  for this trade? and 4) Why is it important for me to execute each order
                  according to plan? (See Plan to Work and Work Your Plan.) These are all
                  part of being a disciplined options trader. Discipline also occurs as a result
                  of researching each trade before you take the plunge. In short, you must
                  learn all the things you need to do to trade successfully. You’re reading this
                                book, so you’re off to a good start!</p>

                                <h3>Practice Makes Perfect</h3>
                                <p>As you learn the particulars of puts and calls, ITM, OTM, and everything
                                    else associated with the options trading world, you might want to create a
                                    virtual portfolio. Many beginning investors do this with stocks, and it tends
                to work well with options, too. Anything that makes you feel more
                comfortable before you put your money on the line is a good thing, and
                with virtual or “paper” trading, you are free to make mistakes and learn
                from them.
                </p>
                <p>Paper trading allows you to ready yourself for the tasks involved in
                    options trading. You’ll learn to analyze the options available and organize
                                        your record keeping, and you’ll observe how the market responds to certain
                                        factors and how you should respond. You’ll be forced to face certain
                                        situations that could be nail-biting if your money were truly on the line, but
                                        if you do it on paper and succeed, you’ll be more confident when it’s the
                 real thing.</p>
                 <p>Some experts discourage paper trading because they believe it’s just too
                     easy on the psyche. Options trading can be a true roller coaster ride, and by
                     taking the ride on paper without a true risk, you cannot prepare yourself
                     emotionally for the losses you might encounter as you trade. Others note
                     that paper trading does not help with the understanding of trade execution.
                     </p>
                     <p>All of that said, however, if you want to practice first, you can paper
                         trade “on paper” or even do it electronically. The CBOE, for example,
                         offers a free virtual trade tool on its website (www.cboe.org), which allows
                         you to test a new strategy before putting it into action. Use their detailed
                         virtual trade screens to get a feel for real options trading. They even offer
                         live chat support when you need it. It’s a win-win situation for anyone
          who’s not quite ready to start trading with her investment funds</p>
          <p>If you do this, it’s important to create realistic scenarios as you trade. If
            you’re not going to be investing $3 million, then don’t paper trade with $3
            million! Only use amounts that you’re going to be able to afford when it’s
            time to do the real thing. Similarly, don’t make aggressive moves that you
            wouldn’t make if this were your actual money. The more you relate your
            paper trading strategies to YOUR reality, the better you’ll do after you exit
            the virtual world.</p>
            <p>Several investment firms offer virtual trading sites, others do not. A few
                of the better paper trading sites are listed below. Each is a little different and
                some have limits as to what you can virtually invest. In most cases, you
                need to open an account (fill out a registration form) to use them.
