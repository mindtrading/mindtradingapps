         <h3>Option Basics</h3>

         <p>Throughout this book, we’ll be talking about stock options. However, there are other types of options which you may delve into at a later time. Here’s a definition of each from the folks at optionstrading.org.</p>
         <ul>
             <li><strong>Stock Options:</strong> The underlying asset for these contracts is shares in a specific publicly listed company.</li>
             <li><strong>Index Options:</strong> These are very similar to stock options, but rather than the underlying security being stocks in a specific company it is an index – such as the S&P 500.</li>
             <li><strong>Forex/Currency Options:</strong> Contracts of this type grant the owner the right to buy or sell a specific currency at an agreed rate.</li>
             <li><strong>Futures Options:</strong> The underlying security for this type is a specified futures contract. A futures option essentially gives the owner the right to enter into that specified futures contract.</li>
             <li><strong>Commodity Options:</strong> The underlying asset for a contract of this type can be either a physical commodity or a commodity futures contract.</li>
             <li><strong>Basket Options:</strong> A basket contract is based on the underlying asset of a group of securities which could be made up of stocks, currencies, commodities or other financial instruments.</li>
         </ul>
     
         <p>But let’s keep it simple for now. Consider this scenario as a way to understand the basic premise of stock options trading.</p>
         <p>I know a fashion designer who is an eccentric genius. She makes incredible dresses that you just can’t find anywhere else. There’s nothing like them! She makes them all by hand, and she does all the work herself. The only drawback is that she only makes these dresses in the summer, and she only makes about 10 of them each year.</p>
         <p>It’s the middle of winter, and I’ve made a deal to buy one of this designer’s summer dresses for a price of $100. I’ve guaranteed the purchase using a contract. The contract states that I have the right to purchase a dress at $100 at any time before the third Friday of September. To secure my option to buy the dress, I paid a fee, or premium, of $50.</p>
     
<p><blockquote>Note : This $50 is not a deposit or down payment. It will not be deducted from the $100 I will
    eventually pay to own a dress. The $50 premium is merely the price of my right to buy the dress
    for $100 before the third Friday in September</blockquote></p>

    <p>In July, I decide to exercise my option to buy a dress. Per my contract, I
        pay $100 for the dress. On the same day I decide to go to the designer’s
        Etsy page and take a look at the other dresses she’s selling. They are all
        priced at $200. I decide, rather than keeping the dress, to sell it to another
        party for $200. Since I paid only $100 plus the premium payment of $50, I
        profited $50 from my purchase of an option</p>
       <h3>What are Options?</h3>
       
        <p> <img src="img/1.webp" /></p>
        <p>Options are contracts. They entitle a party to purchase or sell a specific
            asset (stock, real estate, merchandise) for a specific price within a certain
            window of time. They also oblige a separate party to sell or purchase the
            specific asset. For instance, in the example above, just as my option
            contract guaranteed me the right to buy the dress for $100, the dress maker
            was obliged to sell the dress for $100. In every option contract there is a
            buyer and a seller. One party, either the buyer or the seller, has an
            obligation to participate in a particular transaction per the dictates of the
            options contract. The other party, either the buyer or the seller, has the
            option to participate in a particular transaction per the dictates of the
            options contract. In the example above, I paid $50 for the option to buy a
            dress for $100 before the third Friday in September. Just because I owned
            this option does not mean that I was obliged to execute it. I was the owner
            or buyer of the option. The dressmaker, who was obligated to sell me the
            dress, was the writer or seller of the option.</p>
        <h3>What are Stocks?</h3>
        <p> <img src="img/2.webp" /></p>
        <p>If you’re thinking about delving into the world of options, you’re
            probably already familiar with stocks. But, just as a refresher – a stock is a
            piece of a company. When a company decides to be a “public” company, it
            issues shares of stock for purchase by the general public. The more “stocks”
            or pieces you purchase, the more of the company you own, though, in most
            cases, unless you own thousands of shares, your piece is pretty small.<br><br>

            Now that you are technically a co-owner of this company, you are
            awarded a portion of the profits. If the company is performing at its best,
            your stock goes up in price and you see a profit, usually paid to you in the
            form of dividends, which are sums of money paid out to investors on a
            regular basis (usually quarterly). But if the company isn’t performing well
            for one reason or another, you assume a loss. In this case, the dividends you
            receive are lower or, in some cases, you don’t receive any at all.<br><br>

            In order to trade options, you DO NOT need to own stock in the company
            with which you are trading. However, if you’re the writer/seller of the
            option, then owning the stock will lessen your risk. These are called
            “covered” options and we’ll talk about them in a later chapter.
            </p>

            <h3>Options in the Stock Market</h3>
            <p>
                Though option contracts have been around in some form since the days
                of ancient Greece1
                , it wasn’t until 1973 that the trading of stock options
                became formally institutionalized in the Chicago Board Options Exchange
                (CBOE). Prior to the CBOE, the general public was highly mistrustful of
                trading stock options. Contracts were difficult to enforce, and even brokers
                had a difficult time accurately pricing options. The CBOE saw to it that
                stock option contracts were all standardized and that a clearing corporation
                was formed (Options Clearing Corporation or OCC) that would be
                responsible for ensuring that contracts were enforced. There was still a lot
                of doubt about whether options trading would catch on with the general
                public, but after a few years in business, the CBOE was buzzing with
                trading activity. Since that time, options trading has become a persistent
                facet of major securities exchanges across the globe.</p>


                <p>Currently, there are a total of six options exchanges in the United States. They all have excellent websites where new and experienced traders can gather general information about options trading as well as more specific information on the listings they handle. These sites are good tools and should be perused as you begin your options journey.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>American Stock Exchange (AMEX) www.amex.com</li>
        <li>Boston Options Exchange (BOX) www.bostonoptions.com</li>
        <li>Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) www.cboe.com</li>
        <li>International Securities Exchange (ISE) www.ise.com</li>
        <li>New York Stock Exchange (NYSE/ARCA) www.nyse.com</li>
        <li>Philadelphia Stock Exchange (PHLX) www.phlx.com</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Now, with six markets, the process of options trading seems complicated
        right off the bat. However, some key participants in your options trading
        venture will help you navigate these markets and better understand the
        entire process.
        </p>
        <h3>The Broker</h3>
        <p>If you already have a stock broker, chances are that he or she can also
            handle options trading for you. However, some brokers specifically deal in
            options. As with stocks, you simply instruct them as to what kind of
            transaction you’d like to carry out, and they do the legwork and charge you
            a commission to put the trade in motion. You can ask them to buy new
            contracts, sell contracts you already own, or write new contracts to sell. You
            can also provide them with certain orders about buying and selling at
            particular prices. In all, they can manage all aspects of your options
            portfolio.</p>
            <p>As you enter the world of options trading, look for a full-service broker
                rather than a discount broker. The latter merely takes orders and executes
                them. The former is more expensive commission-wise but should take the
                time to meet with you personally and get to know your financial
                circumstances and investment goals.<br><br>
                Once you feel you are sufficiently experienced in the field of options
                trading and have become quite hands-on in your trading, you may decide to
                go with the less-expensive option of a discount broker.
                </p>
                    <h3>The Market Maker</h3>
                <p>
                    The market maker isn’t a person you’ll ever meet or even see. Rather, the
                    term refers to a broker-dealer firm that takes on the risk of holding multiple
                    shares of a particular security so that trading in that security can happen. In
                    other words, the market maker does exactly as the name suggests – provides
                    a market for your options order. They are there to keep the markets running
                    smoothly and to ensure a certain amount of liquidity. To accomplish that,
                    they step in if there are no public orders to match a required trade by
                    maintaining a sizeable and diverse portfolio of options contracts.</p>
                    <p>For example, suppose you want to buy options contracts for Google, but
                        no one from the general public is selling at the moment. The market maker
                        steps in and sells you those options from its own portfolio.<br><br>
                        If not for market makers, there would be far fewer transactions occurring,
                        it might be difficult to buy or sell, and the options available would be
                        severely limited.</p>
                        <h3>The Options Clearing Corporation</h3>
                        <p>
                            The <strong>Options Clearing Corporation (OCC)</strong> is the firm that guarantees that
                   options sellers meet their obligations and complete their transactions. As a
                   clearing house, it literally moves billions of dollars a day, which makes it
                   one of the largest equity derivatives clearing organizations in the world.
                   You won’t ever need to contact them, most likely, but it’s good to know
                   they’re there to make trades run smoothly.</p>

                   <h3>Options Industry Council</h3>
                   <p>This is an investor education partnership formed by the six options
                      exchanges mentioned previously. For those new to the options market, the
                      OIC is a wonderful tool and its website provides a plethora of information
                      about listed stock options. Check it out at www.optionscentral.com.
                      </p>
                      <h3>Why Were Options Such a Hit?</h3>

                      <p> <img src="img/3.webp" /></p>

                      <p>As you see, options trading has gained a lot of attention over the past few
                        decades. There’s no definitive explanation for its resounding success. Just
                        as in any other product or pursuit, there was no way to be sure of that
                        success prior to testing the market. Part of the appeal of options trading, no
                        doubt, is the potential to realize faster and larger profits than in the
                        traditional stock market. Options also provide a way for investors to
                        participate in the stock market with less investment. That’s because you
                        don’t have to own shares of a stock to trade options associated with that
                        stock. If an investor is familiar with a certain stock and believes she can
                        predict its movement, then purchasing an option allows that investor a
                        chance to capitalize on that stock’s behavior without having to purchase the
                        stock outright.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Options vs. Stocks</h3>

                        <p>Not everyone who “plays” the stock market is interested in trading
                            options. Depending on your financial portfolio as well as your goals, your
                            broker may advise against it due to the risk. So whether or not you get
                            involved depends on just how willing you are to take a chance with your
                            cash.<br><br>
                            Indeed, the stock market is simpler to navigate than the options market.
                            In general, you only have to worry about one thing – whether the stock is
                            going up or down. With options, as you’ll see in future chapters, you have
                            to get three things right – the direction it’s moving, the timing, and the
                            magnitude. In stock transactions, losses tend to be smaller – you rarely lose
                            100% of your investment as you might with options. Furthermore, if a stock
                            is in a losing position, you can usually just wait it out until it gets back to
                            fair market value.<br><br>
                            Options can be scary, but they do have their advantages. Investing in
                            options allows you to tie up a lot less of your cash on hand, as you’ll see
                            when we discuss strategies in a later chapter. Hence, options have greater
                            leveraging power. The potential for higher returns is certainly present as
                            well, particularly with less cash outlay. Finally, options are a very flexible
                            investment tool and create more investment alternatives, ideal for those who
                            want a diverse portfolio. Of course, neither stocks nor options carry with
                            them any sort of guarantee. It’s your job, along with your broker, to
                            determine what kind of risks you are able to take and if you can live with
                            the potential consequences. That’s why books like this, which outline the
                            basics and explain the strategies, are essential.
                            </p>
