         <h3>Key Influencers on Options Prices</h3>
         <p>The price of a given option at any point in time is influenced by several
            factors. In this chapter, you’ll learn about the most important factors that
            affect how much you will pay for an option (or how much you will receive
            for selling one).
            </p>
            <h3>Why You Should Care About How Options Are Priced</h3>
            <p>You may be thinking that options trading is essentially a bet that a stock
                is going to either rise or decrease in value, which will in turn make a given
                option valuable or worthless. Why should you care about other factors?<br><br>
                While the price of the underlying asset (the stock) is certainly a huge
                factor in determining the value of an option, it’s most assuredly not the only
                one. Remember, most of the options you end up owning you will resell, not
                execute. The goal is essentially the same as it is with any other portfolio
                strategy: you want to buy low and sell high, and in order to carry out this
                strategy intelligently, you need to know all of the intricacies that go into
                determining the price for a given option.
                </p>
                <p><img src="img/11.webp"/></p>
                <p>Perhaps George Fontanills puts it best, “The primary reason [for
                    understanding the key influencers of options pricing] is that understanding
                    the key price influences is the simplest method to establish realistic
                    expectations for how an option position is likely to behave under a variety
                    of conditions.12”</p>
                    <h3>The Moneyness Factor</h3>
                    <p>Chapter 3 talked about the concept of being in the money (ITM) or out of
                        the money (OTM). The difference between an option’s set strike price and
                        the price of the underlying asset or stock is known as the moneyness factor,
                        and Fontanills argues that moneyness is the most critical determinant of an
                        option’s price. You can see the moneyness factor at work in virtually any
                        option chain. Take, for instance, an option chain for Tyco International.</p>
                        <p>In Fg. 12 a series of call options are listed for Tyco International (TYC),
                            complete with the current bid and ask prices. The per share price of TYC is
                            $32.22, and the strike prices for the call options range from $29 to $37.
                            Since these are call options, any strike price below the current price is said
                            to be ITM. As you are sure to see in most any option chain, options become
                            less expensive the less in the money and the more out of the money they
                            become.</p>

                            <h3>Time Value & Time Decay</h3>
                            <p>The second most critical factor that influences an option’s price is the
                                time of expiration on the contract. As was stated in Chapter 2 and
                                emphasized continually by writer and trader, Edward Olmstead, “time is
                                money.” The time factor is also the most important distinction between
                                owning a stock and owning an option. Because options lose their value over
                                time, they are considered wasting assets. The phenomenon of an option
                                losing value over time is commonly referred to as time decay.
                                </p>
                                <p>In Olmstead’s book, Options for the Beginner and Beyond, he offers a
                                    really interesting way to think about time value – in terms of hype.
                                    Olmstead compares the expensive option contract with lots of time left until
                                    expiration to a hot, flash-in-the-pan Christmas toy whose hype drives its
                                    price up, but only on a temporary basis. Also, rather than “moneyness,”
                                    Olmstead uses the term intrinsic value and his explanation of time value (or
                                    hyped value) in relation to intrinsic value is quite useful. He suggests that
                                    the hyped value of an option can be seen clearly as what’s left over after the
                                    option’s intrinsic value has been taken into account13.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Let’s take Olmstead’s theory and apply it to a specific case study. For
                                        instance, let’s say you’ve got 100 shares of Alphabet Inc. valued at $758.09
                                        per share (GOOG), which is going to cost you about $75,809. You can buy
                                        a call option with a $750 strike price for about $10.60 per share. This option
                                        is in the money (ITM), and its intrinsic value can be calculated by
                                        subtracting the strike price ($750) from the price of the asset itself
                                        ($758.09), which leaves you with $8.09 for the intrinsic value. That’s about
                                        $2.50 less than the price of the option. Therefore, as Holmstead might say,
                                        the leftover $2.50 is the “hyped value” or time value of the option. As it
                                        turns out, you’re looking at a call option that expires in only 3 days, so that
                                        explains the relatively small hype value/time value.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>Let’s look at that same option, but with a more substantial duration
                                            remaining on the contract. Let’s do a contract of five weeks rather than
                                            three days and see what happens. It turns out that the same option is now
                                            going to cost you $26 per share. The intrinsic value hasn’t changed, it’s still
                                            $8.09 or ($758.09-$750), but that’s because you’re looking at an option
                                            with 5 weeks (35 days) left in the contract, as opposed to 3 days.
                                            Subtracting the intrinsic value of $8.09 from the price of the new option,
                                            $26, leaves you with $17.91 in “hyped value.”
                                            </p>
                                            <p>Now let’s take that last example in which you calculated a time
                                                value/hype value of $17.91 and take a look at the put option for the same
                                                stock (GOOG) at the same strike price ($750) and for the same 35-day
                                                period. It’s no accident that you find that put option priced at $17.87,
                                                essentially the same price as the time value of the call option. This is no
                                                coincidence. The reasons are rather complicated and perhaps beyond the
                                                scope of this beginner-level text, but what’s important to accept is that time
                                                value/hype value should always be consistent between calls and puts when
                                                you’re dealing with both the same underlying asset and the same strike
                                                price.</p>
                                                <h3>Volatility</h3>
                                    <p>Volatility refers to the propensity of a certain financial instrument to
                                        significantly fluctuate in value over time.<br>
                                        When you think rationally about what makes an option profitable, you
                                        will come to the conclusion that there must always be some significant
                                        movement in the price of the option, driven by movement in the price of the
                                        underlying asset that outpaces the time-decay, which devalues the option.
                                        Therefore, if you purchase an option that’s not inclined to fluctuate much in
                                        price, then there’s a much slimmer chance that your option will end up big
                                        in the money. On the other hand, if your option is volatile and subject to
                                        wide swings in pricing, then you’ve got a chance to make a big profit.<br><br>
                                        The way volatility is evaluated and used in trading options is one of the
                                        key distinctions between trading in options and trading in conventional
                                        stocks. With a conventional stock, high volatility means that not only can
                                        you profit big, but you can also lose big. When you own an option, it’s
                                        either going to be exercised or it’s not. If things go really badly and the
                                        numbers move against your option with extreme prejudice, the end result is
                                        that the option will expire without ever being exercised. The same end
                                        result will occur if your option finishes its contract just barely out of the
                                        money. Therefore, according to this logic, the ability of volatility to hurt
                                        you is limited, whereas its ability to help you is unlimited.</p> 
                                        <p>While it’s good to understand the nature of the playing field you’re
                                            dealing with when trading options, it does get a little more complicated
                                            when you consider the fact that your options can be sold before the
                                            expiration date to help you turn a profit or limit a loss. If the option
                                            dramatically plummets in price, and you sell it off for much less than what
                                            you paid for it, then you may find yourself wishing you’d bought a less
                                            volatile option. Generally, though, volatility is going to increase the
                                            premium of an option, because there is a greater chance that on any given
                                            day during the contract, the underlying asset will jump deep into the money
                                            and the option owner will have more chances to either sell off the option at
                                            a profit, or to exercise the option for a profit.</p>
                                            <p>There are several ways to evaluate volatility. In options trading, historical
                                                volatility and implied volatility are commonly utilized metrics. Historical
                                                volatility refers to the observed behavior of a given financial instrument in
                                                terms of price fluctuation in the past. Implied volatility, often referred to as
                                                “IV”, by contrast, is an assessment of the asset’s potential for future
                                                volatility and considered by some to be the quintessential metric
                                                determining an options chance of becoming profitable.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>Implied volatility is generally expressed in percentages. In his book, The
                                                    Options Course, Harvard MBA graduate, George Fontanills claims that any
                                                    implied volatility lower than 20 percent is considered low15
                                                    . Let’s see if we
                                                    can witness the influence of implied volatility in the real marketplace.</p>
                                                    <p>In Fg. 13, look at the $70 call option, way at the bottom of the list. It’s
                                                        nearly $5 out of the money and will sell for about 57 cents per share
                                                        (somewhere between $.55 and $.59). The implied volatility, which can be
                                                        found in the column at the far right hand side, is 28.71 percent.</p>
                               <p><img src="img/13.webp"/></p> 
                               <p>Now, let’s take a look at the more volatile WWE call options with the
                                same expiration date:
                                </p>
                                <p><img src="img/14.webp"/></p> 
                                <p>If you look at the very bottom of the of your option chain you’ll find a
                                    call option with a $22 strike price that can be had for at least 20 cents per
                                    share if not cheaper. Like your Time Warner, this option is a total of $5 out
                                    of the money and its IV rating is nearly double that of Time Warner at
                                    56.64%. So, with such a high volatility rate, why is the WWE option $5 out
                                    of the money almost half the price of the Time Warner option, also $5 out
                                    of the money? The answer: scaling.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>WWE stock is worth $17.33 per share, whereas Time Warner is worth
                                        $65 a share. For the cheaper WWE stock, $5 OTM is a much more
                                        significant hurdle to overcome for the option to ever be profitable, even
                                        with a higher implied volatility. The lesson here is that the volatility is
                                        scalable to the price of a stock, hence it’s expressed as a percentage value.</p>
                                        <p>If you look at WWE’s performance over the last year (Fg. 15), you’ll
                                            notice that the only discernible spike in the value of the stock cleared the
                                            $22 threshold. Therefore, in order for that $22 call option to be profitable,
                                            you’d need the stock to return to that level by January 15th, or at least get
                                            close enough to it before the expiration date in order to resell this option at
                                            a profit. It doesn’t look very likely—hence, buying the call would only cost
                                            you 20 bucks.</p>

                                            <p>Let’s look at the same 1-year graph for Time Warner:</p>
                                            <p><img src="img/16.webp"/></p> 
                                            <p>Unlike WWE, TWX has spent plenty of time over the last year trading 
                                                above the $70 strike price. It looks like things were a bit dicey through the 
                                                fall, but there’s still been movement above $70. This looks like a more 
                                                promising option than the WWE purchase, and, of course, it’s a little more 
                                                expensive. But before you pay the $57 to buy the option, you should 
                                                probably try to get a read on what caused TWX to plummet during the late 
                                                summer and early fall, and whether or not there’s a decent chance for a 
                                                bounce back within the next month.</p>
                                      <p><img src="img/17.webp"/></p> 
                                      <p>Let’s take a look at a stock that trades at a similar price point as TWX.</p>
                                      <p>The 58.com Inc. stock (WUBA) is currently trading at near $70. When you
                                        locate the $75 call option for WUBA—that’s $5 out of the money (see the
                                        bottom most call option listing in Fg. 16)—you’ll notice that the implied
                                        volatility percentage is greater than it was with the TWX stock, nearly 41%,
                                        compared to 29%.  The price of the WUBA option is significantly more
                                        expensive, about $1.35 per share compared to TWX’s 57 cents. That’s a
                                        hefty price differential for a similar position on a similar stock. Perhaps
                                        there are more forces at work driving up the price of the WUBA Jan 75 call.
                                        Let’s take a look at the stock’s performance this year.</p>
                                        <p><img src="img/18.webp"/></p> 
                                        <p>There are two things that stand out blatantly in WUBAs performance
                               over the last 12 months (within the context of the potential purchase of the
                               Jan 75 call option). It looks like the stock traded at over $75 last spring for
                               some time, then dropped off. But it also appears that the stock is beginning
                               to ascend in value, so maybe it’s due to keep ascending.</p>
                               <p>It’s the opinion of this author that the extra hefty price for the WUBA call
                                   is mainly due to the apparent ascending trend. WUBA looks to be on the
                                   way up, whereas fewer people are inclined to believe that TWX is going to
                                   rebound any time soon. Not to mention the fact that WUBA has greater
                                   overall implied volatility.
                                   </p>
                                   <p>Just for kicks and insight, let’s do a similar comparison between these
                                       two similar stocks on the other end of the option spectrum. Let’s look at a
                                       put option for TWX that’s likewise $5 out of the money:
                                       </p>
                                       <p><img src="img/19.webp"/></p> 
                                       <p>In the image above you can see that there is similar pricing and similar
                                        implied volatility between the put and the call options, each $5 OTM. The
                                        put option is slightly less expensive, most likely because, as shown in the
                                        graph on Fg. 16, TWX doesn’t have an immediate history of sinking below
                                        $60, whereas it’s spent a whole lot of time upwards of $70.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>Options traders largely rely on the strategy of searching for discrepancies
                                            between a stock’s historical volatility and its implied volatility. If an options
                                            trader can spot an option with an implied volatility that’s too low given its
                                            historical volatility, then that option is said to be cheap and may prove to be
                                            a good deal. If the historical volatility indicates that an option’s implied
                                            volatility is too high, then the option is thought to be expensive and should
                                            be sold if possible. Traders are also looking for mismatches between the
                                            implied volatility of an option and the volatility of its underlying asset. If
                                            the asset is more volatile than the options with which IV credits it, then
                                            you’ve got an option worth buying. If the asset is more stable than is
                                            reflected by the IV, sell it away16.</p>
                                            <p>Implied volatility is a concept that you understand more the more often
                                                you use it. As Michael Sincere says, “To demonstrate how difficult it is to
                                                define, I’d like you to answer a question. Can you define gravity?” Sincere
                                                goes on to offer a very psychologically-focused explanation of implied
                                                volatility: “It’s the urgency, or expectation, that the stock price might
                                                undergo a big change that drives traders to bid-up the options (forcing both
                                                the premium and implied volatility higher).17”</p>

                <h3>Interest Rates & Dividends</h3>
                <p>Though interest rates and dividends aren’t as important as the other
                    factors influencing options pricing, they still must be acknowledged. When
                    interest rates (the cost of borrowing money) go up, the price of calls
                    generally increase and puts decrease. The opposite is true when interest
                    rates go down.<br><br>
                    When dividends of the underlying asset increase, the price of calls
                    decrease and the price of puts increase. When dividends decrease, the
                    opposite occurs18. <br><br>
                    We won’t get into the specific mechanisms of these rather
                    negligible factors in this text.<br>
                    The next chapter drills down even further on option evaluation metrics by
                    offering information about the “Greeks.”</p>
