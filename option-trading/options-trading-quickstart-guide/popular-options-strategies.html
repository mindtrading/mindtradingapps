         <h3>Popular Options Strategies</h3>
         <p>As stated previously, you’re not going to automatically profit on an option
            just because your option is ITM. You also have to account for the amount
            you paid to own the option. Traders use a concept called a “breakeven
            point” to help them clarify when they’re actually holding a profitable
            option.<br><br>
            For calls, your breakeven point can be calculated simply by adding your
            strike price to the premium you paid to own the option. If I own a $49 call
            option on a stock worth $50 (already ITM), and I paid $2 a share to own
            this option, then my breakeven point is equal to $49+$2 or $51. Once the
            stock rises above $51, then and only then is my option truly profitable.
            </p>
            <p>Here’s an example of how utilizing the breakeven point is helpful when
                assessing and monitoring options strategy:<br><br>
                Chapter 3 discussed selling the covered call option, whereby an option is
                sold on a stock you own, one that you’re comfortable selling at a certain
                price. You used DuPont, which was trading at $32.18, and you sold a
                covered call option with a strike price of $35. You sold the option for about
                $.50 per share. Using this strategy, in order for the party who bought your
                option to reach his breakeven point, the price of DuPont would have to
                climb to at least $35.50 before the expiration period. Now, from the
                perspective of your position, and, assuming that you’re truly committed to
                unloading all of your DuPont stock, there is another breakeven point that
                you need to keep in mind. You collected $50 (.50 x 100) from the sale of
                the $35 call option, and, as the owner of 100 shares of DuPont, you’re
                losing $50 every time the stock declines by $.50. Therefore, as the
                writer/seller of the covered call, your breakeven point is the price you paid
                for the stock, $32.18, minus the per-share price of the call option ($.50)—
                $31.68. In other words, even if you pad your coffers by selling the call
                option, your DuPont play is still going to lose money if you end up getting
                out at $31.68 or lower</p>
                <h3>Straddling a Stock Using Options</h3>
                <p>The straddle tactic is both easy to understand and potentially useful for
                    investors who believe that they can spot interesting trends in the market. In
                    Chapter 4, we took a look at the WWE stock when trying to assess implied
                    volatility and its effect on the pricing of options. Every late March or early
                    April, the WWE brings its signature product, “Wrestlemania”, to the
                    market. There’s always a whole lot of talk about whether the current year’s
                    Wrestlemania is going to be a successful event, and in the aftermath of the
                    spectacle major changes are revealed that affect the direction of the
                    company, most notably, who is going to be the WWE’s new champion, as
                    well as who’s going to be retiring or who’s going to be coming back or
                    stepping up to a bigger role. If you look at the WWE’s stock performance
                    chart over the last five years (Fg. 29), you’ll notice that there are some
                    significant fluctuations in the stock’s price occurring between the months of
                    March and May. For the sake of argument, let’s say that you can’t pinpoint
                    whether or not Wrestlemania leads to the plummeting of the stock’s value
                    or raises it, but you’re quite certain that it changes it in some particular way,
                    and dramatically.</p>
                    <p><img src="img/28.webp"/></p>
                    <p>In this event, you might consider using a straddle strategy. In a straddle, a
                        put and a call option are purchased for the same stock at the same strike
                        price. Let’s say that next February the WWE stock is trading at around $15
                        per share. You decide to straddle the stock by purchasing an ATM call and
                        an ATM put option. Each option costs you a dollar per share to purchase, so
                        you’ve technically invested $200 if you’re buying standard 100 share put
                        and call contracts.</p>
                        <p><img src="img/29.webp"/></p>
                        <p>You know that Wrestlemania is on April third this year, so you select the
                            third Friday in April for your expiration date. Now, in order for you to make
                            money on your straddle, the WWE stock needs to be either above $17 ($2
                            above $15) or below $13 ($2 below $15) by the end of the contract. Hence,
                            breakeven points on the straddle strategy are expressed as two limits: above
                            x or below y or beyond the range of x to y. In straddle plays, you need
                            higher implied volatility to have a good chance to pass the breakeven point,
                            but, unfortunately, as always, options with higher implied volatility are
                            likely to prove to be expensive. Furthermore, whenever a company is about
                            to release big news or put a significant product on the market for the first
                            time, the price of all options associated with that stock are inclined to spike
                            somewhat in anticipation of some major movement.</p>
                            <p><img src="img/30.webp"/></p>
                            <h3>The Strangle</h3>
                            <p>The strangle strategy is like the straddle except the call and the put are
                                set to different prices, usually with the put strike price being lower.
                                Investors generally turn to the strangle when they’d rather pay a little bit
                                less in premiums while betting that the stock will move well past the
                                breakeven point for either option. For example, General Motors is trading at
                                $33. You decide to pursue a strangle strategy by purchasing a cheap OTM
                                call option with a strike price of $36. The call costs you 50 cents per share
                                in premiums. You concurrently purchase a cheap put option with a strike
                                price of $31, and you pay $1 per share. Your total (combined) premium
                                payment is $1.50. Therefore, in order to break even on the strangle, you
                                need General Motors to rise above $37.50 ($36 + $1.50) or drop below
                                $29.50 ($31-$1.50). Just as with your straddle strategy, the strangle strategy
                                should be driven on the assumption that a stock is going to change in price,
                                either up or down (you’re not sure which). A strangle will give you more
                                options than a straddle and will also give the investor a chance to enter into
                                a market position for potentially less money</p>
                                <p><img src="img/31.webp"/></p>
                                <h3>A Bull (or Bear) Spread</h3>
                                <p>The vertical spread refers to the simultaneous purchase and sale of calls
                                    or puts on the same stock at different strike prices. As with the previous two
                                    strategies, the purpose of the spread is to provide the investor with
                                    flexibility of positioning. Let’s reuse the General Motors example,
                                    assuming the stock is still trading at about $33. If you decide to buy a call
                                    on GM with a strike price of $35 and sell a call with a strike price of $37,
                                    you’re still going to end up paying an overall net premium, as the $35 call
                                    option that you bought is more expensive than the $37 option that you sold.
                                    For the purpose of this illustration, let’s assume that you paid $.50 to buy
                                    your $35 call and that you sold your $37 call for $.20. Therefore, your total
                                    premium payment to establish your current position is $.30.</p>
                                    <p>In order for your spread to pass the breakeven point, the stock must rise
                                        higher than $35.30 ($35 + .30). If the stock ends up at any point between
                     $35.30 and $37 (within the spread), then the $37 call will not be exercised
                     and you’ll take a profit. Should the stock soar above $37 and you’re forced
                     to oblige the call you sold, then your profit will cap out at $1.70
                     ($37-$35.30) regardless of how much higher the stock surges above $37. In
                     other words, even if the stock soars to $40 or higher, for all intents and
                     purposes, in your universe, the stock ended up at $37, as you are preobliged to sell the stock at this price.
                     </p>
                     <p>The moral of the story on spreads is that they allow you to cut down on
                         the expense of your premiums, but they limit, to an extent, your capacity for
                         profit. Spreads are very popular among professional investors who would
                         gladly trade away a shot-in-the-dark chance at seeing an enormous profit if
                         it means cutting down on their risk.</p>
                         <p><img src="img/32.webp"/></p>
                         <p>The trade illustrated in Fg. 32 in which two calls are concurrently bought
                             and sold at different strike prices is known as a bull spread, as the investor
                             needs the stock to behave bullishly (go up) in order to see a profit.<br><br>
                             A bear spread can be executed by simultaneously purchasing and selling
                             put options on the same stock at different strike prices. Just like in the bull
                             spread, you’re trading limited profitability for a less expensive premium.
                             Here’s a list of several other strategies for your consideration. Your
                             broker can enlighten you as to whether or not they’d work for you and, of
                             course, you can virtually practice them until you’re comfortable with
                             attempting them for real.</p>
                             <h4>The Cash-Secured Put</h4>
                             <p>The cash-secured put is used by investors who are looking to acquire
                                ownership of a stock, but want to get in with minimal expenditure. To
                                accomplish this, the investor writes a put option that’s slightly OTM. If the
                                stock doesn’t go down in price and the put option is not assigned, then the
                                investor pockets the premium and may write/sell another put option. When
                                the stock waxes bearish, the investor purchases the underlying stock near
                                the strike price and hopes that the stock turns quickly bullish before his new
                                acquisition is assigned via the put option. The main idea of the cash-secured
                                put is to use premium revenues from the sale of the put option to mitigate
                                the cost of acquiring the sought-after stock.</p>
                                <h4>The Married Put</h4>
                                <p>A married put weds long stock with a long put to provide protection for the
                                    investor. For this strategy, you purchase the stock and the put at the same
                                    time. This strategy functions like an insurance policy and provides a “floor”
                                    should the asset’s price plunge suddenly and drastically. Experts say the
                                    married put provides the investor with limited risk and unlimited reward.
                                    As with many strategies, timing is key, but with the married put you can
                                    protect yourself against potential short-term losses.</p>
                                    <p><img src="img/33.webp"/></p>
                                    <h4>The Protective Collar</h4>
                                    <p>The protective collar strategy occurs when an investor purchases an out-ofthe-money (OTM) put option and writes an OTM call option at the same
                                        time for the same underlying asset (i.e. shares of stock). This strategy works
                                        best after a long position in a stock has produced significant gains and is the
                                        perfect way to lock in profit without selling your shares. Try to purchase the
                                        stock and the put during low-volatility conditions for the best outcome. This
                                        allows you to buy longer-term protection.</p>
                                        <p><img src="img/34.webp"/></p>
                                        <h4>The Butterfly Spread</h4>
                              <p>According to Dr. Joe Duarte,cite the Butterfly Spread combines the
                                  aforementioned bull put spread and bear put spread expiring the same
                                  month for a debit. The image of the butterfly is used because the two short
                                  puts possess the same strike price and are said to make up the body of the
                       butterfly. Conversely, the two long puts include different strike prices
                       (above and below the proverbial “body”) and they are said to be the wings.
                       This strategy provides limited risk with limited reward and can get
                       expensive due to the trading costs associated with the three positions
                       involved. However, it’s an interesting strategy and one that’s good to try on
                       paper as you practice your options trading.
                       </p>

                       <h4>The Iron Condor</h4>
                       <p>While we’re discussing winged creatures…the Iron Condor involves an
                           investor holding both a long and a short position in two different strangle
                    scenarios. This is a fairly complex strategy that is not meant for the
                    beginner as it takes time to master. However, once you’re ready to exceed
                    the safe havens of covered calls and other beginner strategies, and if you’re
                    someone who really enjoys “having some skin in the game”, you’ll love the
                    excitement of the Iron Condor. When you’re ready, ask your broker about it
                    and, again, practice it on paper until you feel confident about the
                    particulars.
                    </p>
                    <p><img src="img/36.webp"/></p>
                               <p>Remember, NO strategy is risk free. All carry different degrees of reward
                                   and risk, and you need to decide – as you progress – whether you wish to
                         continue to play it safe or if you’re willing (and can afford) to be a little

                         <h3>Rolling Positions</h3>
                         <p>The term “rolling” refers to one of the most common ways to adjust an
                            option’s position. You can roll either a long or a short option position, but in
                            order to stay in tune with the beginner-level knowledge in this book, we’ll
                            focus on rolling the short position.</p>
                            <p>Understand, first of all, that with rolling, there are no guarantees. As with
                                everything you do in the options market, you are “speculating” and hoping
                                that the moves you make result in a profit rather than a loss. Whenever you
                                roll a short position, you’re buying back an option you initially sold--
                                thereby closing that position--and writing/selling a new option on the same
                                stock but with a different strike price, thereby opening a new position.<br><br>
                                Let’s take a look at three of the more basic types of rolling positions:</p>
                                <h4>Rolling the Covered Call</h4>
                                <p>When you choose to roll a covered call, you go in the “up and out”
                                    direction. You’re looking to go “up” in strike price and to go “out” in time.
                                    This way you balance the decrease in premium you’d encounter for selling
                                    a higher OTM strike price in contrast to the greater premium you’d receive
                                    for selling an option that is further from its expiration date. Here’s an
                                    example:</p>
                                    <p>Suppose you select a buy-to-close order for the front-month 80-strike
                                        call. At the exact same time, you sell to open an out-of-the-money 85-strike
                                        call (this is “rolling up”) that expires in 60 days (this is referred to as
                                        “rolling out”). Due to higher time value, the back-month 85-strike call is
                                        trading for $2.50. So, you pay $2.30 to buy back the front-month call and
                                        receive $2.50 for the back-month call. Hence, you do this trade for a net
                                        credit of $0.20 ($2.50 sale price - $2.30 purchase price) or a total of $20.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>There are positives and negatives here and maybe some things that make
                                            you a bit nervous. On one hand, since you raised the strike price of the
                                            option to $85, you can potentially make more profit on the stock since the
                                            obligation was originally at $80. You had to buy back the first-month call
                                            for more money than you received when selling it, BUT you covered that
                                            cost by selling the back-month strike call for more premium.</p>
                                            <p>The risk is present because there are two months left before the
                                                expiration date of the new options, and you have no idea what might
                                                happen with the price of the stock during that period of time. It may
                                                proceed in your favor…but you might see a loss as well. Remember, there’s
                                                time for the market to move in a direction that won’t be to your advantage.
                                                You have to decide whether or not it’s worth taking that chance.
                                                </p>
                                                <h4>Rolling a Cash-Secured Put</h4>
                                                <P>In this scenario, you want to roll “down and out” in order to avoid
                     assignment. This is converse to the “up and out” direction you want to go
                     when rolling the covered call. Here’s an example:</P>
                     <p>You’re going to sell a 30-day cash-secured put on your favorite stock,
                         Melody Musical Instruments. It has a strike price of $50. When the stock
                         was trading at $52, you received a premium of $.80 per share for selling the
                         put option. However, the stock is now trading at only $49.50, and it’s
                         getting close to the expiration date. You’re worried. So, you need to be sure
                         to avoid assignment by buying back that front-month 50-strike put and,
                         therefore, cancel your obligation. However, that front-month put you sold
                         way back when for $.80 is now selling for $1.45.
                         </p>
                         <p>So, what can you do to accomplish the roll? You need to enter a buy-toclose order for the front-month 50-strike put. In the same trade, you need to
                             sell to open a back-month 48.50-strike put (this is the rolling down part), 90
                             days from expiration (rolling out) which is trading for $1.70. By doing this,
                             you receive a net credit of $0.25 ($1.70-$1.45) or a total of $25.
                             </p>
                             <p>The increase in time value of the 90-day option therefore allows you to
                                 roll for a net credit of $25 even though the back-month put is further out-ofthe-money. The caveat? Whenever you do a down and out roll, you might
                                 take a loss on the front-month put. In addition, you’re not sure in what
                                 direction the market will move in the months before the expiration, so you
                                 really haven’t secured any gains on the back-month put, which exposes you
                                 to further risk. Hence, you should always do a down and out roll for the
                                 shortest possible time period.
                                                                </p>
                  <h4>Rolling a Short Call Spread</h4>
                  <p>Similar to rolling individual options, you can roll a spread by moving strike
                      prices up or down and moving out in time. However, with a spread, there
                      are generally four options to be traded during the process (closing two and
                      opening two) instead of just two. This, in itself, makes it a little more
                      complicated right off the bat.</p>
                      <p>Remember that favorite stock... Melody Musical Instruments? Well, now
                        it’s trading at $53 and you’re in a bearish position. Your broker advises you
                        to sell a 55/60 short call spread 30 days from expiration time. As such, let’s
                        say you’re going to receive a net credit of $1.00. But now the stock is
                        heading upwards and is selling at $55.50. There are only 15 days left until
                        the expiration date and, sadly, the cost to buy back the spread has risen to
                        $1.70.
                        </p>
                        <p>You think that this is just a fluke, and your research shows that this stock
                            is going to go back down. So, you decide to roll up and out. That means
                            you’re rolling up in strike price and out in expiration time.<br><br>
                            So, you buy back the 55/60 short call spread for $1.70 and, at the same
                            exact time, sell another short call spread that has a short strike of 60, a long
                            strike of 65, and is 45 days from expiration. As a result, you receive a credit
                            of $1.10. You wind up with a net debit of -$.60. However, if the stock is
                            below $60 by the time you reach the new expiration date, you’ll be back in
                            the money to the tune of $.40. (That’s the $1.00 net credit to open the 55/60
                            spread minus the $1.70 net credit to close it, plus the $1.10 net credit to
                            open the new 60/65 spread.)<br><br>
                            Sound complicated? It is! And, remember, your forecasts about the
                            direction of the stock prices need to be on-the-mark if you’re going to
                            navigate this roll successfully. You should definitely ditch instead of roll if
                            you’re not confident in your predictions.
