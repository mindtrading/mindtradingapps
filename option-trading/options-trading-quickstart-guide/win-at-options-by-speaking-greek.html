         <h3>Win at Options By Speaking Greek</h3>
         <p>It wouldn’t be a book on options trading without the inevitable foray into
            the world of the Greeks. The Greeks refer to several key metrics denoted by
            a Greek letter, only a small handful—delta, gamma, theta, vega, and rho—
            are in the vocabulary of the typical options trader, with delta being the most
            useful.
            </p>
            <p><img src="img/21.webp"/></p>
            <h3>Delta</h3>
            <p>Part of what makes delta useful is that it’s quite easy to understand. As
                we explained in Chapter 2, if you buy an option and suddenly the
                underlying stock spikes in the right direction, it’s more advantageous (and
                usually more profitable) to resell the option than execute the option. What
                the delta metric does is tell you how much the price of your option is
                expected to move when the underlying stock moves by a single point.
                Though the data provided from delta isn’t iron clad, it can prove to be an
                extremely useful reference point when trying to gauge the potential
                profitability of an option.</p>
            <p>Deltas are always going to have an absolute value between 0 and 1,
                though traders often drop the decimal place—saying the option has a 50
                delta, as opposed to a .5 delta. Calls always have a positive delta and puts, a
                negative delta.<br><br>
                Usually the delta is given, especially on brokerage sites or exchange
                websites that specialize in options trading, but it’s also easy to calculate the
                delta for an option. All you need is snapshots of the both the stock’s value
                and the option’s value. Take a call option, for instance. Let’s say the stock is
                on the market for $30, and there’s a call option with two months to go
                before expiration that’s currently ATM (at the money) and a $30 call
                contract that may currently be purchased for $1 per share. When the stock
                goes up in value, let’s say to $32, the call option is also going to become
                more valuable. (In this case the call option is suddenly $2 in the money.)
                Let’s say that the call option goes from $1 per share to $2 per share. The
                delta of the option is calculated by dividing the change in the option price
                by the change in the stock price. In this example you get 1 divided by 2, or
                .5. This is commonly referred to as a “50 delta.”</p>
                <p><img src="img/22.webp"/></p>
                <p>Using this formula, you can see why calculating the delta value of a put
                    option always results in a negative number. As the price of the stock goes
                    up, the value of the put option always goes down, so you always end up
                    dividing a negative number by a positive number, or vice versa, resulting in
                    a negative delta value.</p>
            <h3>Using Delta to Prevent Common Frustrations</h3>
            <p><img src="img/23.webp"/></p>
            <p>One of the things that frustrates beginner-level options traders, and may
                turn them off to options entirely, is purchasing an option and watching the
                stock value move $2 or even $3 in the “right” direction only to find that the
                value of the option has barely changed. Many beginners first approaching
                the options market may be drawn to the very inexpensive, out of the money
                option contracts with very little time left on the contracts. Sure you can get
                one of these contracts for $20, but it’s not likely to make you any money.
                The reason for this is that the delta value of out of the money option
                contracts near the point of expiration is close to zero. Even if the stock
                moves significantly toward the money, the option may not gain any
                significant value. A lot of these extremely cheap, nearly expired OTM
                options are the equivalents of a Hail Mary pass. Learning how to read an
                option’s delta value can spare you from this frustration.
                </p>
                <h3>Gamma</h3>
                <p><img src="img/24.webp"/></p>
          <p>Gamma measures the expected change of the delta value in relation to a
              $1 change in the price of a stock. Remember, the delta value is anything but
              constant throughout the life of an option, but the extent to which it
              fluctuates may hinge on a few different factors, such as the proximity to the
              option’s expiration date.
              </p>
              <p>For the beginner-level options trader, the most important thing to
                  understand about the gamma metric is the concept of gamma risk. If your
                  gamma level is high and you’re in a position to make a profit or minimize
                  loss by selling or exercising your option, then you may be wise to do so
                  since the option could quickly deteriorate.<br><br>
                  Though gamma analysis is used by the pros, especially in risk
                  assessments, it’s not essential that you have a thorough understanding of
                  how to leverage this metric when you’re just starting out. The bottom line
                  of the gamma metric is that when gamma increases, the prices of your
                  options are more sensitive to changes in the price of the stock.</p>
                  <h3>Theta</h3>
                  <p><img src="img/25.webp"/></p>
                  <p>Theta measures the price change of an option in relation to a unit of time
                    (usually a day). As you know by now, the closer an option gets to its
                    expiration date, the less value it tends to have—all other factors being
                    equal. What the theta metric does is quantify the extent to which this value
                    is changing on a day-by-day basis. Theta, therefore, is a negative value.
                    This lost value, in options jargon, is often referred to as “theta decay.”</p>
                    <p>For a beginner, you should understand that theta decay detracts from the
                   value of an option at an ever increasing rate. If you’ve got an option you’re
                   thinking about selling, and there are three weeks or so left in the contract,
                   be prepared for the theta decay to make a serious dent in the value of your
                   option. The closer you get to your expiration date, the more severe the theta
                   decay.</p>
                   <p>In Options for Beginners, Edward Olmstead offers an illustration on theta
                       decay using simple square roots. He says, “The magnitude of theta for an
                       at-the-money option varies inversely as the square root of the time
                       remaining until expiration20
                       .” That may seem like a bit of a mouth full, but
                   when you consider it within the context of a real scenario it’s a bit clearer.</p>
              <p>Again, if you can’t get your head fully around theta yet, just know that
               the time decay becomes more impactful the closer the option comes to
               expiring. Also understand, however, that theta is never the end all/be all that
                determines the value of your options. Any investor should realize from the
                moment she purchases an option that it’s going to start going down in value
                and that, in order for the option to prove profitable, the underlying asset
                must move in the right direction with a decent magnitude of delta force
                behind it (assuring that the option price will move in the right direction as
                well).</p>
                <p><img src="img/26.webp"/></p>
                <h3>Vega</h3>
                <p>We don’t have an image of the Greek letter vega, because vega is not a
                    real Greek letter. Vega indicates the amount of change expected in an option
                    price for every percent change in implied volatility. Remember, options
                    with underlying assets perceived to be highly volatile tend to be more
                    expensive than options with more stable underlying assets. Vega is meant to
                    show the specific degree to which changes in implied volatility may affect
                    the price of an option.</p>
                    <p><img src="img/27.webp"/></p>
                    <h3>Rho</h3>
                    <p>The final Greek we will discuss is Rho, which is considered by the
                        experts to be the least important of all the Greeks21
                        . Rho measures the effect
                        of interest rates (on US treasury bills) on the pricing of options. The Rho
                        metric can be either negative (for puts) or positive (calls). As of the writing
                        of this book (2015), interest rates are so low that the Rho metric is
                        negligible.</p>
