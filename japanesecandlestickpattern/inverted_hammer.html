   <h1 style="text-align: center;">What Is the Inverted Hammer Candlestick?</h1>
   <center>

   </center>
   <p>The Inverted Hammer candlestick formation occurs mainly at the bottom of downtrends and can act as a warning of a potential bullish reversal pattern.</p>
   <p>What happens on the next day after the Inverted Hammer pattern is what gives traders an idea as to whether or not prices will go higher or lower.</p>
   <table style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%; background-color: #2dc26b;" border="1" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1">
   <tbody>
   <tr>
   <td style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ffffff;">What Does the Inverted Hammer Look Like?</span></td>
   </tr>
   </tbody>
   </table>
   <p>The Inverted Hammer formation is created when the open, low, and close are roughly the same price. Also, there is a long upper shadow which should be at least twice the length of the real body.</p>
   <p><strong><img class="img-fluid" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="images/InvertedHammerPic.webp" alt="" /></strong></p>
   <p>Let&rsquo;s take a simple example:</p>
   <ul>
   <li>The price of HDFC Bank opens at 100.</li>
   <li>Goes up to 105.</li>
   <li>Then falls to close at 101.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>The above price action will create a candle that looks like an &lsquo;inverted hammer&rsquo;.</p>
   <p>Simple as that.</p>
   <p>&nbsp;</p>
   <table style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%; height: 22px; background-color: #2dc26b;" border="1">
   <tbody>
   <tr style="height: 22px;">
   <td style="width: 100%; text-align: center; height: 22px;"><span style="text-align: center; color: #ffffff;">Inverted Hammer Trading Strategy</span></td>
   </tr>
   </tbody>
   </table>
   <p>Observe the chart below and notice how the price of a company called &lsquo;United Spirits&rsquo; had been falling continuously for several days. This happened in March 2020.</p>
   <p><img class="img-fluid" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="images/Inverted-Hammer-Trading-Strategy-768x460.webp" alt="" /></p>
   <p>Now, focus on the bottom-most candle which is an &lsquo;inverted hammer&rsquo;,</p>
   <p>After a big fall on the previous day, the stock opens below, rises high, and then closes slightly above the opening price. This creates the &lsquo;inverted hammer&rsquo;.</p>
   <p>This is the first signal that the stock has fallen enough and it could now rise upwards.</p>
   <p>Traders would now wait for the next candle. If that is green, the stock should be bought when the price goes above the &lsquo;high&rsquo; of the &lsquo;inverted hammer&rsquo;.</p>
   <p>The stop loss would be the &lsquo;low&rsquo; of the &lsquo;inverted hammer&rsquo; candle.</p>
   <p>To explain this more clearly, we have taken only the three candles from the above chart and marked the inverted hammer trading strategy.</p>
   <p><img class="img-fluid" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="images/Inverted-Hammer-Buy-and-Stop-Loss.webp" alt="" /></p>
   <p>Let me repeat.</p>
   <p>Once the &lsquo;inverted hammer&rsquo; candle is formed on the chart &ndash; the trader waits for the next candle.</p>
   <p>If the next candle is red and the price falls below the &lsquo;inverted hammer&rsquo;, the pattern has failed. No trades should be taken.</p>
   <p>If the next candle is green and the price goes higher &ndash; the trader waits till the price goes above the high of the &lsquo;inverted hammer&rsquo;.</p>
   <p>This confirms that the buyers are in control and the price could go higher.</p>
   <p>The stock is bought. A strict stop loss is set at the bottom price of the &lsquo;inverted hammer&rsquo; &ndash; as clearly illustrated in the above image.</p>
   <p>Do note, a stop loss is very important and an absolute must for every trade you take. If the price goes below the &lsquo;inverted hammer&rsquo; candle &ndash; it means the reason we took the trade has failed.</p>
   <p>The loss has to be taken. This is part of the discipline, which is arguably the most important aspect of becoming a successful trader.</p>
   <p>Always take small trades in the beginning. Learn to take profits, learn to take losses. Your mind will slowly get conditioned to accept both.</p>
   <p>Remember, not every trade can be successful. Even the best of traders only get 6-7 out of 10 trades right. And we talking about the best traders here. New traders have much lower success ratio.</p>
   <p>As a trader gains experience, he can tweak and create his own trading strategy. This takes time and effort. In the beginning, concentrate on learning and observing the charts.</p>

   <p>Long term investors can wait for &lsquo;trend reversal&rsquo; candlestick patterns to buy quality stocks close to the bottom.</p>
   <p>On March 23, 2020, when the Indian stock market hit a low after crashing for many days &ndash; due to Covid-19 &ndash; many stocks formed &lsquo;inverted hammer&rsquo; and &lsquo;hammer&rsquo; on the chart.</p>
   <p>If the market is witnessing a significant fall &ndash; even long-term investors who are waiting for the &lsquo;bottom&rsquo; of quality stocks &ndash; can take positions when such &lsquo;trend reversal&rsquo; candles are formed on the chart.</p>
   <p>They could start with a small position and buy more once the stock begins to rise.</p>
   <p>There is a saying in the market &ndash; &ldquo;never catch a falling knife&rdquo;.</p>
   <p>When the market is falling and stocks are crashing every day &ndash; like it happened in March 2020 &ndash; a good strategy is to wait till markets stabilize.</p>
   <p>Let the market complete the correction and show signs that it is about to rise. You might have to buy 10-15% higher than the bottom, but in most cases &ndash; your average price will be lower than &lsquo;averaging down&rsquo; from the beginning of the correction.</p>

   </table>
   <p>After a long downtrend, the formation of an Inverted Hammer is bullish because prices hesitated to move downward during the day.</p>
   <p>Sellers pushed prices back to where they were at the open, but increasing prices shows that bulls are testing the power of the bears.</p>

   </tbody>
   </table>
   <p>When the low and the open are the same, a bullish, <strong><span style="color: #2dc26b;">green</span></strong> Inverted Hammer candlestick is formed and it is considered a stronger bullish sign than when the low and close are the same (a <span style="color: #e03e2d;"><strong>red</strong></span> Inverted Hammer).</p>
