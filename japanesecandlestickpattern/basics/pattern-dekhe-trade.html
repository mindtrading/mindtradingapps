    <strong>How to trade by looking at chart patterns?</strong><br><br>
    
    Trading using chart patterns requires certain steps:<br>


    <li>Identify the previous market trend.</li><br>
    <li>Wait for the chart pattern to form and complete.</li><br>
    <li>Determine if the pattern signals a continuation or a reversal of the trend.</li><br>
    <li>Identify the point where the price breaks out of the pattern.</li><br>
    <li>Confirm this breakout when the price closes outside the trendline, accompanied by an 
      increase in volume. This is a safe time to make trades, especially if there's a 
      retracement after the initial breakout.</li><br>
    <li>Set stop levels below the support or resistance line or the previous candle of the entry candle.</li><br>
   <li>The first trading target can be the highest high of the pattern from the breakout point.</li><br>


    <strong>But chart patterns also have limitations:</strong><br><br>

    <li>OFalse breakouts: Sometimes the price reverses after a breakout, which is opposite 
       to what the pattern predicts.</li><br>
    
     <li>Different interpretations: The same pattern might mean different things to different traders.</li><br>
    
     <li>Not obvious in real-time: Patterns are easier to identify in retrospect than in live markets.</li><br><br>
    
     <li>Illusory patterns: Traders sometimes perceive a pattern where none exists.</li><br><br>

   <strong>In conclusion,</strong> though chart patterns have their shortcomings, they're a 
   powerful tool in trading. Identifying them in live markets offers a competitive edge. However, 
   theyâ€™re most effective when used in conjunction with other technical analysis tools.
