    <strong>What is a chart Pattern?</strong><br><br>
    
    A chart is a graphical representation of data to make information more digestible and less daunting. 
    Different types of charts like line charts, bar charts, pie charts, etc., present data 
    through distinct symbols such as lines, bars, and segments.<br><br>

    <strong>Line Chart </strong>
    
    This type is a simple chart traditionally used to graphically illustrate the fluctuations 
    in share prices across different time frames - monthly, weekly, daily, hourly, and even 
    by the minute. Still in use today, line charts on Google, for instance, primarily display 
    closing prices of shares at the end of a specific period. It's less complex and provides 
    fewer data compared to a candlestick chart.<br><br>
    
    Picture drawing graphs in school, with time on the x-axis and price on the y-axis, 
    plotting the closing prices at the end of chosen intervals and connecting these points 
    into a chart - that's essentially a line chart.<br><br>

    <strong>Candlestick Chart </strong>

    While a line chart centers on the closing price, a candlestick chart offers more insights by 
    comprising the opening price, closing price, highest price, and lowest price of a share. 
    This chart type makes it easier to visualize fluctuations in the share price or even an 
    index point like Nifty 50 over a set period, offering a broader snapshot of market behavior.<br><br>

   The term 'Time Frame' or 'Time Interval' refers to the specific period in which price 
   changes are highlighted on any stock market chart. Adjusting this time frame can present 
   various perspectives on the same share price. While a wider time frame provides a generalized 
   overview, a shorter one reveals minute variations. Time frames can range from 1 year to 1 month, 
   1 week, 1 day, varying hours and minutes, and in some cases, even 30 seconds!
