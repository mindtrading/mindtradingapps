    <strong>Understanding Different Kinds of Candlesticks</strong><br><br>
    
    In the given example, you've already seen some types of candlesticks. In addition, 
    there are other types based on price fluctuations, each with its unique shape. 
    By understanding these different types, we can determine the relative positions 
    of buyers and sellers in the market at any given time.<br><br>

    Moreover, by closely aligning various candlestick patterns, one can visualize the next move over time.<br><br>
    
    A more extensive discussion on this topic can be found in other articles.<br><br>
    
    <strong>Limitations</strong><br>


    Without examining a live chart, it is not possible to understand when and how the price 
      fluctuations occurred during a timeframe in a candlestick. Similarly, 
      we cannot obtain information about which of the highest and lowest prices 
      was reached first and which was reached later.<br><br>

    
    Various interpretations can be drawn from charts with different time frames. 
    In the end, despite the pros and cons, chart patterns have a vast application in trading. 
    If one can spot them in a live market, competitive advantages can be gained. 
    However, they are most effective when used in conjunction with other technical analysis tools.
