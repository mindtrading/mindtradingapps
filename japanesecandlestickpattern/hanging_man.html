   </center>
<p>Hanging man is a bearish reversal candlestick pattern that has a long lower shadow and a small real body.</p>
<p>This candlestick pattern appears at the end of the uptrend indicating weakness in further price movement.</p>
<p>It is formed when the bulls have pushed the prices up and now they are not able to push further.</p>
<p>This candlestick chart pattern has a small real body which means that the distance between the opening and closing price is very less.</p>
<p>There is no upper shadow and the lower shadow is twice the length of its body.</p>
<p>This pattern provides an opportunity for traders for squaring their buy position and enter a short position.</p>

<p>Here is the formation of the Hanging Man Candlestick Pattern:</p>

<p>As you read the next two paragraphs, try to visualize why the Hanging Man candle gets formed.</p>
<p>The stock has been on an uptrend for the last 3 months. The price has risen steadily. One day, you see the price falling heavily (due to selling pressure). But the price recovers to end slightly above or below the opening.</p>
<p>In other words, the bears (sellers) tried to take control and bring the price down. But the bulls (buyers) resisted the fall and took the price back up. That&rsquo;s how the &lsquo;Hanging Man&rsquo; candle gets formed.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;Hanging Man&rsquo; can be one of the first signs of weakness during an upward trend. It could happen because of &lsquo;profit booking&rsquo; or &lsquo;expensive valuations&rsquo;. But in purely technical terms, it&rsquo;s a sign of weakness for the stock.</p>
<p>If the exact same candle gets formed during a downtrend, it&rsquo;s called a &lsquo;Hammer&rsquo; and it could potentially reverse the downtrend and take the stock upwards.</p>

<p>In the chart above, Reliance Industries was in an uptrend. The stock had risen significantly over a short period of time. There was weakness in between, but the &lsquo;Hanging Man&rsquo; candle resulted in a sharp downfall.</p>
<p>The short-term trend reversal for Reliance was confirmed when the candle next to the &lsquo;Hanging Man&rsquo; was also bearish.</p>

</table>
<p>If a stock has risen way too much in a short period of time, investors can look for &lsquo;Hanging Man&rsquo; candles to book full or partial profits.</p>
<p>Candles like &lsquo;Hanging Man&rsquo; can be used in combination with Fundamental Analysis. If the price-to-earning ratio (P.E) is too high and the stock is showing bearish signs on the chart, profits can be booked.</p>
<p>However, selling your winning stocks after a single bearish candle isn&rsquo;t the right approach.</p>
<p>Long term investors can only make large gains by holding on to winners for a long period of time &ndash; until the trend reversal is confirmed on weekly or monthly charts. Daily charts and lower (60 min time frame etc) are for short to medium term traders only.</p>
<p>Good stocks in an uptrend should not be sold due to short-term weakness on the charts.</p>
