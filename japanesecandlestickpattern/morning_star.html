   <p>The Morning Star pattern is a three-candle, bullish reversal candlestick pattern that appears at the bottom of a downtrend. It reveals a slowing down of downward momentum before a large bullish move lays the foundation for a new uptrend.</p>

   </tbody>
   </table>
   <p>Traders will often look for signs of indecision in the market where selling pressure subsides and leaves the market somewhat flat. This is where Doji candles can be observed as the market opens and closes at the same level or very close to the same level. This indecision paves the way for a bullish move as bulls see value at this level and prevent further selling. The appearance of the bullish candle after the Doji provides this bullish confirmation.</p>

   <p>Identifying the Morning Star on forex charts involves more than simply identifying the three main candles. What is required, is an understanding of previous price action and where the pattern appears within the existing trend.</p>
   <ol>
   <li>Establish an existing downtrend: The market should be exhibiting lower highs and lower lows.</li>
   <li>Large bearish candle: The large bearish candle is the result of large selling pressure and a continuation of the existing downtrend. At this point traders should only be looking for short trades as there is no evidence of a reversal yet.</li>
   <li>Small bearish/bullish candle: The second candle is a small candle - sometimes a Doji candle - that presents the first sign of a fatigued downtrend. Often this candle gaps lower as it makes a lower low. It does not matter if the candle is bearish or bullish as the main takeaway here is that the market is somewhat undecided.</li>
   <li>Large bullish candle: The first real sign of new buying pressure is revealed in this candle. In non forex markets, this candle gaps up from the close of the previous candle and signals the start of a new uptrend.</li>
   <li>Subsequent price action: After a successful reversal, traders will observe higher highs and higher lows but should always manage the risk of a failed move through the use of well-placed stops.</li>
   </ol>

   <p>The Morning Star pattern can be observed in the EUR/GBP chart below, where there is an established downtrend leading up to the formation of the reversal pattern.</p>
   <p>Looking at the chart, once the formation has completed, traders can look to enter at the open of the very next candle. More conservative traders could delay their entry and wait to see if price action moves higher. However, the drawback of this is that the trader could enter at a much worse level, especially in fast moving markets.</p>
   <p>Targets can be placed at previous levels of resistance or previous area of consolidation. Stops can be placed below the recent swing low, as a break of this level would invalidate the reversal. Since there are no guarantees in the forex market, traders should always adopt sound risk management while maintaining a positive risk to reward ratio.</p>
   <p><img class="img-fluid" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="images/morning-star-candlestick_body_TradingthemorningstarEURGBP.webp" alt="" /></p>
   <p>When trading the Morning Star on forex markets, the price will very rarely gap as they do with stocks and so the three-candle pattern usually opens very close to the previous closing level.</p>
