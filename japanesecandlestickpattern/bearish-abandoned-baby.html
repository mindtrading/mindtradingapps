   <h1 style="text-align: center;">What is Bearish Abandoned Candlestick Pattern?</h1>
   <p>The bearish abandoned baby pattern signals reversal to the downtrend and is used by the traders to exit a buy position and enter a short position.</p>
   <p>It is formed at the end of an uptrend and is composed of three candlesticks.</p>

   <p>As we have discussed above abandoned baby pattern is a reversal candlestick pattern.</p>
   <p>A bullish abandoned baby pattern signals an end of the selling pressure of the bears and the return of the bulls in the market.</p>
   <p>On the other hand, bearish abandoned baby signals that bulls are leaving and indicate the return of the bears in the market.</p>
   <p>The psychology behind the formation of a bullish abandoned baby suggests that the market has witnessed a significant sell-off in the first candle.</p>
   <p>Because of this reason, a bearish candlestick is formed.</p>
   <p>A Doji candlestick pattern is formed afterward, which confirms that now a market is uncertain as to whether the opening and closing prices are the same.</p>
   <p>In this case, it indicates that the bears are losing their grip and the bulls are taking over the market.</p>
   <p>The third bullish candle confirms that the trend has been reversed to an uptrend and also gaps higher from the Doji.</p>
