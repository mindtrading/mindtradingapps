   <p>What is traded in forex?</p>
   <p>The simple answer is&nbsp;<strong>MONEY</strong>. Specifically, currencies.</p>
   <p>Because you&rsquo;re not buying anything physical, forex&nbsp;trading can be confusing so we&rsquo;ll use a simple (but imperfect) analogy to help explain.</p>
   <p>Think of buying a currency as buying a&nbsp;<em>share</em>&nbsp;in a particular&nbsp;<strong>country</strong>, kinda like buying shares in a company.</p>
   <p>The price of the currency is usually a&nbsp;direct reflection of the market&rsquo;s opinion on&nbsp;the current and future health of its respective economy.</p>
   <p>&nbsp;</p>
   <p>In forex trading, when you buy, say, the Japanese yen, you are basically buying a &ldquo;share&rdquo; in the Japanese economy.</p>
   <p>&nbsp;</p>
   <p><img src="images/JPY-coin.png" /></p>
   <p>You are&nbsp;<em>betting</em>&nbsp;that the Japanese economy is doing well, and will even get better as time goes.</p>
   <p>Once you sell those &ldquo;shares&rdquo; back to the market, hopefully, you will end up with a profit.</p>
   <p><strong>In general, the exchange rate of a currency versus other currencies is a reflection of the condition of that country&rsquo;s economy, compared to other economies.</strong></p>
   <p>&nbsp;</p>
   <p>By the time you graduate from this&nbsp;School of Pipsology, you&rsquo;ll be eager to start working with currencies.</p>
   <p>&nbsp;</p>
   <h2>Major Currencies</h2>
   <p>While there are potentially lots of currencies you can trade, as a new forex trader, you will probably start trading with the &ldquo;<strong>major currencies</strong>&ldquo;.</p>
   <p><img src="images/major-currencies.png" /></p>
   <p>They&rsquo;re called &ldquo;<strong>major currencies</strong>&rdquo; because they&rsquo;re the most heavily traded currencies and represent some of the world&rsquo;s largest economies.</p>
   <p>Forex traders differ on what they consider as &ldquo;major currencies&rdquo;.</p>
   <p>The uptight ones who probably got straight A&rsquo;s and followed all the rules as children only consider USD, EUR, JPY, GBP, and CHF as major currencies.</p>
   <p>Then they label AUD, NZD, and CAD as &ldquo;<strong>commodity currencies</strong>&ldquo;.</p>
   <p>For us rebels, and to keep things simple, we just consider all eight currencies as the &ldquo;majors&rdquo;.</p>
   <p>&nbsp;</p>
   <p>Below, we list them by their symbol, country where they&rsquo;re used, currency name, and cool nicknames.</p>
   <p>&nbsp;</p>
   <div>
   </div>
   <p><img src="images/table.png" /></p>
   <p><img src="images/major-currencies-babypips.png" /></p>
   <p>Currency symbols always have&nbsp;<strong>three letters</strong>, where the first two letters identify the name of the country and the third letter identifies the name of that country&rsquo;s currency, usually the first letter of the currency&rsquo;s name.</p>
   <p>These three letters are known as&nbsp;<strong>ISO 4217 Currency Codes.</strong></p>
   <p>By 1973, the&nbsp;<strong>International Organization for Standardization</strong>&nbsp;(ISO) established the three-letter codes&nbsp;for currencies that we use today.</p>
   <p><img src="images/currency-code.png" /></p>
   <p>Take&nbsp;<strong>NZD</strong>&nbsp;for instance&hellip;</p>
   <p><strong>NZ</strong>&nbsp;stands for New Zealand, while&nbsp;<strong>D</strong>&nbsp;stands for dollar.</p>
   <p>Easy enough, right?</p>
   <p>The currencies included in the chart above are called the &ldquo;majors&rdquo; because they are the most widely traded ones.</p>
   <p><strong>DID YOU KNOW?</strong>&nbsp;The&nbsp;<strong>British pound</strong>&nbsp;is the world&rsquo;s oldest currency that&rsquo;s still in use, dating back to the 8th&nbsp;century. The newest currency in the world is the&nbsp;<strong>South Sudanese pound</strong>, made official on July 18, 2011.&nbsp;</p>
   <p>We&rsquo;d also like to let you know that &ldquo;buck&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t the only nickname for USD.</p>
   <p>There&rsquo;s also: greenbacks, bones, benjis, benjamins, cheddar, paper, loot, scrilla, cheese, bread, moolah, dead presidents, and cash money.</p>
   <p>So, if you wanted to say, &ldquo;I have to go to work now.&rdquo;</p>
   <p>Instead, you could say, &ldquo;Yo, I gotta bounce! Gotta make them benjis son!&rdquo;</p>
   <p><strong>FUN FACT:</strong>&nbsp;In Peru, a nickname for the U.S. dollar is Coco, which is a pet name for Jorge (George in Spanish), a reference to the portrait of George Washington on the $1 note?</p>

   <p><small>They call me Coco yo!</small></p>
