    <p>Each retail forex broker or CFD provider sets their own Margin Call Level and Stop Out Level.</p>
    <p><strong>It&rsquo;s crucial to know what your broker&rsquo;s Margin Call and Stop Out Levels are!</strong></p>
    <p>A lot of traders don&rsquo;t even bother to find out what they are before opening their account, they just jump right into trading!</p>
    <p>These levels are frequently ignored or overlooked by traders to the detriment of their account!</p>
    <p><strong>Different forex brokers handle a Margin Call in different ways.</strong></p>
    <p>Some brokers&nbsp;<strong>treat a Margin Call and Stop Out as one and the same</strong>, meaning they will not send you a warning message, they will simply just start closing your trades along with a message notifying you of the action!</p>
    <p>For example, a broker may set their Margin Call Level at 100% with&nbsp;<strong>no separate Stop Out Level</strong>.</p>
    <p>This means that if your Margin Level drops lower than 100%. the broker will automatically close your position without any warnings!</p>

    <p>Other brokers treat a Margin Call and Stop Out differently. They use a Margin Call as a sort of an&nbsp;<strong>early warning message</strong>&nbsp;that your positions are at risk of being liquidated Stop Out).</p>
    <p>For example, a broker may set their Margin Call Level at 100% and their Stop Out Level&nbsp;at 20%.</p>
    <p>This means that if your Margin Level drops lower than 100%, you will receive a WARNING from your broker that you need to close your trade or deposit more money or risk reaching the Stop Out Level.<img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2019/02/14215016/margin-call-warning.png" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 85vw, 500px" srcset="https://bpcdn.co/images/2019/02/14215016/margin-call-warning.png 500w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2019/02/14215016/margin-call-warning-360x317.png 360w" alt="Margin Call Warning" width="500" height="440" />&nbsp;If your Margin Level continues to drop and reaches 20%, then and only then, will the broker automatically close your position (at the best available price).</p>
    <p>Depending on the broker, a &ldquo;<strong>Margin Call</strong>&rdquo; can be one of two things:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>If there is a separate Stop Out, your broker sends you a&nbsp;<strong>warning</strong>&nbsp;that your account equity has dropped below the required&nbsp;Margin Level&nbsp;percentage, There is no&nbsp;Equity&nbsp;to support your open positions any further.</li>
    <li>If there is no separate Stop Out, your broker automatically&nbsp;<strong>closes your trades</strong>, starting from the least profitable one until the required Margin Level is met.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you receive a Margin Call, and don&rsquo;t know your fate, here&rsquo;s a diagram to help you know what will happen to your trade(s).&nbsp;<img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2019/02/14211228/margin-call-flowchart.png" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" srcset="https://bpcdn.co/images/2019/02/14211228/margin-call-flowchart.png 760w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2019/02/14211228/margin-call-flowchart-360x341.png 360w" alt="Margin Call Flowchart" width="760" height="720" />When there is a separate Margin Call and Stop Out Level, think of the Margin Call as a &ldquo;<strong>warning shot</strong>&rdquo; and the Stop Out as the automated action to minimize the chance of your account resulting in a negative balance.</p>
    <p>Since you get a &ldquo;warning shot&rdquo;, this gives traders more time to manage their positions before the automatic liquidation of those positions occurs.</p>
    <p>This is different from the traditional margin call policy where the Margin Call and Stop Out Level are&nbsp;<strong>one and the same</strong>.</p>
    <p>No &ldquo;warning shot&rdquo; is given. You simply just get &ldquo;<strong>shot</strong>&rdquo; (automatic liquidation).</p>
    <p>In the end, it is ultimately&nbsp;<strong>YOUR responsibility</strong>&nbsp;to ensure that your account meets the margin requirements and in the event that if it is not met, your broker has the right to liquidate (&ldquo;Stop Out&rdquo;) any or all your open positions.</p>
    <p>With a solid understanding of margin trading and the use of stop losses, proper position sizing, and risk management, a Stop Out can be easily prevented.</p>
