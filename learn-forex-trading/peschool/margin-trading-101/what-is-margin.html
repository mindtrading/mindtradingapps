    <p>What is margin?</p>
    <p>When trading forex, you are only required to put up a&nbsp;<strong>small amount of capital</strong>&nbsp;to open and maintain a new position.</p>
    <p>This capital is known as the&nbsp;<strong>margin</strong>.</p>
    <p>For example, if you want to buy $100,000 worth of USD/JPY,&nbsp;you don&rsquo;t need to put up the full amount, you only need to put up a portion, like $3,000. The actual amount depends on your forex broker or CFD provider.</p>
    <p>Margin can be thought of as a good faith&nbsp;<strong>deposit</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>collateral</strong>&nbsp;that&rsquo;s needed to open a position and keep it open.</p>
    <p>It is a &ldquo;good faith&rdquo; assurance that you can afford to hold the trade until it is closed.</p>
    <p>Margin is NOT a fee or a transaction cost.</p>
    <p>Margin is simply a&nbsp;<em>portion</em>&nbsp;of your funds that your forex broker sets aside from your account balance to keep your trade open and to ensure that you can cover the potential loss of the trade.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2019/02/13221104/required-margin-vs-position-size1.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>This portion is &ldquo;used&rdquo; or &ldquo;locked up&rdquo; for the&nbsp;<strong>duration</strong>&nbsp;of the specific trade.</p>
    <p>Once the trade is closed, the margin is &ldquo;freed&rdquo; or &ldquo;released&rdquo; back into your account and can now be &ldquo;usable&rdquo; again&hellip; to open new trades.</p>
    <h2>What is Margin Requirement?</h2>
    <p>Margin is expressed as a&nbsp;<strong>percentage</strong>&nbsp;(%) of the &ldquo;full position size&rdquo;, also known as the &ldquo;<strong>Notional Value</strong>&rdquo; of the position you wish to open.</p>
    <p>Depending on the currency pair and forex broker,&nbsp;the amount of margin required to open a position VARIES.</p>
    <p>You may see margin requirements such as 0.25%, 0.5%, 1%, 2%, 5%, 10% or higher.</p>
    <p>This percentage (%) is known as the&nbsp;<strong>Margin Requirement</strong>.</p>
    <p>Here are some examples of margin requirements for several currency pairs:</p>

    <div>
    <table border="1px">
    <tbody>
    <tr>
    <td><strong>Currency Pair</strong></td>
    <td><strong>Margin Requirement</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>EUR/USD</td>
    <td>2%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>GBP/USD</td>
    <td>5%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>USD/JPY</td>
    <td>4%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>EUR/AUD</td>
    <td>3%</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>

    <h2>What is Required Margin?</h2>
    <p>When margin is expressed as a&nbsp;<em>specific amount</em>&nbsp;of your account&rsquo;s currency, this amount is known as the&nbsp;<strong>Required Margin.</strong></p>
    <p>EACH position you open will have its own Required Margin amount that will need to be &ldquo;locked up&rdquo;.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p><strong>Required Margin</strong>&nbsp;is also known as&nbsp;<strong>Deposit Margin</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Entry Margin</strong>, or&nbsp;<strong>Initial Margin</strong>.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s look at a typical EUR/USD (euro against U.S. dollar) trade. To buy or sell a 100,000 of EUR/USD without leverage would require the trader to put up $100,000 in account funds, the full value of the position.</p>
    <p>But with a&nbsp;<strong>Margin Requirement of 2%</strong>, only $2,000 (the &ldquo;<strong>Required Margin</strong>&ldquo;) of the trader&rsquo;s funds would be required to open and maintain that $100,000 EUR/USD position.</p>

    <h3>Example #1: Open a long USD/JPY position</h3>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;ve deposited $1,000 in your account and want to go long USD/JPY&nbsp;and want to open 1 mini lot (10,000 units) position.</p>
    <p>How much margin will you need to open this position?</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2019/02/13191928/USDJPY-required-margin-vs-position-size.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>Since USD is the base currency. this mini lot is 10,000 dollars, which means the position&rsquo;s&nbsp;<strong>Notional Value is $10,000</strong>.</p>
    <p>Assuming your trading account is denominated in USD, since the&nbsp;<strong>Margin Requirement is 4%</strong>, the&nbsp;<strong>Required Margin will be $400.</strong></p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2019/02/13175522/required-margin.png" alt="" /></p>
    <h3>Example #2: Open a long GBP/USD position</h3>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;ve deposited $1,000 in your account and want to go long GBP/USD at 1.30000 and want to open 1 mini lot (10,000 units) position.</p>
    <p>How much margin will you need to open this position?</p>
    <p>Since GBP is the base currency, this mini lot is 10,000 pounds, which means the position&rsquo;s&nbsp;<strong>Notional Value is $13,000</strong>.</p>
    <p>Assuming your trading account is denominated in USD, since the<strong>&nbsp;Margin Requirement is 5%</strong>, the&nbsp;<strong>Required Margin will be $650</strong>.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2019/02/13180307/required-margin-example-gbusd.png" alt="" /></p>
    <h3>Example #3: Open a long EUR/AUD position</h3>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s say you want to go long EUR/AUD and want to open 1 mini lot (10,000 units) position.</p>
    <p>How much margin will you need to open this position?</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2019/02/13192737/EURAUD-required-margin-vs-position-size.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>Assuming your trading account is denominated in USD, you need to first know what the&nbsp;EUR/USD&nbsp;price. Let&rsquo;s say EUR/USD is trading at 1.15000.</p>
    <p>Since EUR is the base currency, this mini lot is 10,000 euros, which means the position&rsquo;s&nbsp;<strong>Notional Value is $11,500</strong>.</p>
    <p>Since the&nbsp;<strong>Margin Requirement is 3%</strong>, the&nbsp;<strong>Required Margin will be $345</strong>.</p>

    <h3>How to Calculate Required Margin</h3>
    <p>When trading with margin, the&nbsp;<strong>amount of margin</strong>&nbsp;(&ldquo;Required Margin&rdquo;) needed to hold open a position is calculated as a&nbsp;<strong>percentage</strong>&nbsp;(&ldquo;Margin Requirement&rdquo;) of the&nbsp;<strong>position size</strong>&nbsp;(&ldquo;Notional Value&rdquo;).</p>
    <p>The specific amount of Required Margin is calculated according to the&nbsp;<strong>base currency</strong>&nbsp;of the currency pair&nbsp;traded.</p>
    <p>If the&nbsp;<strong>base currency is DIFFERENT from your trading account&rsquo;s currency</strong>, the Required Margin is then converted to your&nbsp;<strong>account denomination</strong>.</p>
    <p>Here is the formula to calculate the Required Margin:</p>
    <p>If the base currency is the SAME as your account&rsquo;s currency:</p>
    <pre>Required Margin = Notional Value x Margin Requirement</pre>
    <p>If the base currency is DIFFERENT from your account&rsquo;s currency:</p>
    <pre>Required Margin = Notional Value x Margin Requirement
    x Exchange Rate Between Base Currency and Account Currency</pre>
    <p><strong>The only reason for having funds in your account is to make sure you have enough margin to use for trading.</strong></p>
    <p>When it comes to trading forex, your ability to open trades is not necessarily based on the funds in your account balance. More accurately, it&rsquo;s based on the<strong>&nbsp;amount of margin you have</strong>.</p>
    <p>This means that your broker is always looking to see if&nbsp;<strong>you have enough margin in your account</strong>, which can actually differ from your account balance.</p>
    <p>If this sounds confusing, don&rsquo;t you worry. It&rsquo;ll start to make more sense as we proceed.</p>
