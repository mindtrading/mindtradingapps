    <p>What does &ldquo;Equity&rdquo; mean?</p>
    <p>The&nbsp;<strong>account equity</strong>&nbsp;or simply &ldquo;<strong>Equity</strong>&rdquo; represents the current value of your trading account.</p>
    <p>Equity is the current value of the account and&nbsp;<em>fluctuates</em>&nbsp;with every tick when looking at your trading platform on your screen.</p>
    <p>It is the sum of your account balance and all floating (unrealized) profits or losses associated with your open positions.</p>
    <p><strong>As your current trades rise or fall in value, so does your Equity.</strong></p>
    <h2>How to Calculate Equity If You Have No Trades Open</h2>
    <p>If you do NOT have any open positions, then your Equity is the same as your Balance.</p>
    <pre>Equity = Account Balance</pre>
    <h3>Example: Account Equity When You Have No Open Trades</h3>
    <p>You deposit $1,000 in your trading account.</p>
    <p>Since you haven&rsquo;t opened any trades yet, your Balance and Equity is the same.<img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2019/02/13231958/equity.png" alt="" /></p>
    <h2>How to Calculate Equity If You Have Trades Open</h2>
    <p>If you have open positions, your Equity is the sum of your account balance and your account&rsquo;s floating P/L.</p>
    <pre>Equity = Account Balance + Floating Profits (or Losses)</pre>
    <h3>Example: Account Equity When an Existing Trade is Losing</h3>
    <p>You deposit&nbsp;<strong>$1,000</strong>&nbsp;in your trading account.</p>
    <p>Beyonc&eacute; tweets that she&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>shorting</em>&nbsp;GBP/USD. Because she&rsquo;s Beyonc&eacute;, you follow what she says and go short also.</p>
    <p>Price moves immediately against you and your trade shows a floating loss of&nbsp;<strong>$50</strong>.</p>
    <pre>Equity = Account Balance + Floating Profits (or Losses)
    $950 = $1,000 + (-$50)</pre>
    <p>The Equity in your account is now&nbsp;<strong>$950</strong>.<img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2019/02/13232358/equity-with-floating-loss.png" alt="" /></p>
    <h3>Example: Account Equity When an Existing Trade is Winning</h3>
    <p>Beyonc&eacute; tweets again and says she&rsquo;s changed her mind. She&rsquo;s now&nbsp;<em>long</em>&nbsp;GBP/USD.</p>
    <p>Not only is she Crazy in Love, but she seems crazy in trading also.</p>
    <p>But because she&rsquo;s the Queen B, you follow what she says and go long also.</p>
    <p>Price moves immediately in your favor and your trade shows a floating gain of&nbsp;<strong>$100</strong>.</p>
    <pre>Equity = Account Balance + Floating Profits (or Losses)
    $1,100 = $1,000 + $100</pre>
    <p>The Equity in your account is now&nbsp;<strong>$1,100</strong>.<img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2019/02/13232714/equity-with-floating-profit.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>Your account equity continuously&nbsp;<strong>fluctuates</strong>&nbsp;with the current market prices as long as you have any&nbsp;<strong>open positions.</strong></p>
    <p>Equity shows the &ldquo;TEMPORARY&rdquo; value of your account at the&nbsp;<strong>current time</strong>. (Unlike a tattoo, which is&hellip;<em>not</em>&nbsp;temporary.)<img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2019/02/23191457/equity-tattoo.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>That&rsquo;s why Equity is seen as a &ldquo;<strong>floating account balance</strong>&ldquo;. It will only become your &ldquo;real account balance&rdquo; if you were to close all your trades&nbsp;<em>immediately</em>.</p>
    <h2>What is the difference between Balance and Equity?</h2>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s start with a simple answer.</p>
    <p>If your account is &ldquo;flat&rdquo; or does NOT have any positions open, then your Balance and Equity are the SAME.</p>
    <p>But if you do have open positions, this is when the Balance and Equity differ.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>The&nbsp;<strong>Balance</strong>&nbsp;reflects your&nbsp;<strong>profit/loss from&nbsp;<em>closed</em>&nbsp;positions.</strong></li>
    <li>The&nbsp;<strong>Equity</strong>&nbsp;reflects the<strong>&nbsp;real-time calculation of your profit/loss</strong>. The Equity takes into account both open&nbsp;<em>AND</em>&nbsp;closed positions.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This means that when you&rsquo;re looking at your Balance, it is NOT the actual real-time amount of your funds.</p>
    <p>Since Equity includes current profits or losses from open trades, it is Equity that shows the&nbsp;<strong>real-time amount</strong>&nbsp;of your funds.</p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s possible to have a very large Balance, but very small Equity.</p>
    <p>This happens when your open positions have a&nbsp;<strong>large unrealized (floating) losses</strong>.</p>
    <p>For example, if your Balance is&nbsp;<strong>$1,000</strong>, and you have an open trade that has a floating loss of&nbsp;<strong>$900</strong>.</p>
    <p>Your Equity is only&nbsp;<strong>$100.</strong><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2019/02/13233553/equity-with-floating-loss-900.png" alt="" /></p>
    <h2>Recap</h2>
    <p>In this lesson, we learned about the following:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Equity</strong>&nbsp;is your account balance plus the floating profit (or loss) of all your open positions.</li>
    <li>Equity represents the &ldquo;real-time&rdquo; value of your account.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s move on and learn about the concept of&nbsp;<strong>Free Margin</strong>.</p>
