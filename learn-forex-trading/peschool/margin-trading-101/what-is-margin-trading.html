    <p>The biggest appeal that forex trading offers is the ability to trade on&nbsp;<strong>margin</strong>.</p>
    <p>But for many forex traders, &ldquo;margin&rdquo; is a foreign concept and one that is often misunderstood.</p>
    <p>Like Bob.<img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2019/02/12231124/bob-the-forex-trader.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>Bob sure knows his fried chicken and mashed potatoes but absolutely has no clue about margin and leverage.</p>
    <p><strong>Margin trading gives you the ability to enter into positions larger than your account balance.</strong></p>
    <p>With a little bit of cash, you can open a much bigger trade in the forex market.</p>
    <p>And then with just a small change in price moving in your favor, you have the possibility of ending up with massively huge profits.</p>
    <p>But for most new traders, because they usually don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re doing, that&rsquo;s not what usually happens.</p>
    <p>More likely, price does move, but it moves&nbsp;<em>against</em>&nbsp;them.</p>
    <p>Like what happened to Bob.</p>
    <p>Bob was in a trade.</p>
    <p>He was sure that this trade was going to be a winner so he bet&nbsp;<em>BIG</em>.</p>
    <p>All of a sudden, to Bob&rsquo;s surprise (and shock), he witnessed his trade being automatically closed on his trading platform and ended up suffering an epic loss.</p>
    <p>The funds that now remain in Bob&rsquo;s account aren&rsquo;t even enough to open another trade.</p>
    <p>Bob is confused. He asks himself, &ldquo;WTF just happened?&rdquo;<img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2019/02/12231922/bob-the-forex-trader-what-happened.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>He contacts his forex broker and is told that he had been &ldquo;sent a&nbsp;<strong>Margin Call</strong>&nbsp;and experienced a&nbsp;<strong>Stop Out</strong>&ldquo;.</p>
    <p>Bob doesn&rsquo;t know what the broker is talking about.</p>
    <p>Bob is CLUELESS.</p>
    <p>This is why understanding how margin works is essential.</p>
    <p>A lot of new traders do not understand the concept of margin, how it&rsquo;s used, how to calculate it, and the significance that it plays in their trading.</p>
    <p>Do you know what&nbsp;<em>margin</em>&nbsp;actually is? What about&nbsp;<em>used margin</em>?</p>
    <p>What is&nbsp;<em>free margin</em>? What is&nbsp;<em>margin level</em>? What is a&nbsp;<em>margin call</em>? What is a&nbsp;<em>stop out</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>margin closeout</em>?</p>
    <p>As you can see, there is A LOT of &ldquo;<strong>margin jargon</strong>&rdquo; used in forex trading.</p>
    <p>Before you choose a forex broker and begin trading with margin, it&rsquo;s important to understand what all this margin jargon means.</p>
    <p>If you don&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s almost guaranteed that you will end up like Bob.</p>
    <p>Terrible things will happen to your trading account like a&nbsp;<strong>margin call</strong>&nbsp;or a&nbsp;<strong>stop out</strong>. But you&nbsp;won&rsquo;t even know&nbsp;<em>what</em>&nbsp;just happened or even&nbsp;<em>why</em>&nbsp;it happened.</p>
    <p>If you really want to understand how margin is used in forex trading, you need to know how your margin trading account really works.</p>
    <p>This starts with understanding what the heck some (really important) numbers you see on your trading platform really mean.</p>
    <p>We&rsquo;ll call these numbers your margin account&rsquo;s &ldquo;metrics&rdquo;.</p>
    <p>For example, take a look at the MetaTrader 4, also known as MT4, trading platform:</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2019/02/21191415/metatrader-margin-metrics.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>The metrics above are all&nbsp;<em>intertwined</em>.</p>
    <p>A change in one causes a&nbsp;change in another.<img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2019/02/18183333/margin-relationships.png" alt="" />As a trader, you need to be aware of the&nbsp;<strong>relationships between them</strong>&hellip;</p>
    <p>BEFORE ever entering a single trade on a live account.</p>
    <p>Don&rsquo;t be like Bob.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2019/02/12232842/mike-not-bob-678x780.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p><strong>Where certain metrics fall below a certain value, BAD THINGS will happen!</strong></p>
    <p>So you need to know what these metrics are!</p>
    <p>You also need to know what these &ldquo;bad things&rdquo; are!</p>
    <p>Make sure you have a solid grasp of how your trading account actually works and how it uses margin.</p>
    <p>So let&rsquo;s dive right in.</p>
    <p>A margin trading account displays the following metrics:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Balance</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Used Margin</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Free Margin</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Unrealized P/L</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Equity</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Margin Level</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>A metric is just a measurement of &ldquo;something&rdquo;.</p>
    <p>This means that every metric above measures something important about your account involving margin.</p>
    <p>For example, the &ldquo;Balance&rdquo; measures how much cash you have in your account.&nbsp;And if you don&rsquo;t have a certain amount of cash, you may not have enough &ldquo;margin&rdquo; to open new trades or keep existing trades open.</p>
    <p>Depending on the trading platform, each metric might have slightly different names but what&rsquo;s being measured is the same.</p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s take another look at the metrics on MetaTrader 4.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2019/02/21191626/metatrader-account-metrics.png" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" srcset="https://bpcdn.co/images/2019/02/21191626/metatrader-account-metrics.png 640w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2019/02/21191626/metatrader-account-metrics-360x105.png 360w" alt="MetaTrader4 Metrics" width="640" height="186" /></p>
    <p>You&rsquo;ll notice that it looks like that &ldquo;Used Margin&rdquo; is not displayed. But it&rsquo;s there. MetaTrader 4 just displays it as &ldquo;Margin&rdquo;.<img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2019/02/18190509/metatrader-y-u-do-dis.png" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" srcset="https://bpcdn.co/images/2019/02/18190509/metatrader-y-u-do-dis.png 760w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2019/02/18190509/metatrader-y-u-do-dis-150x150.png 150w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2019/02/18190509/metatrader-y-u-do-dis-360x360.png 360w" alt="Y U do dis?" width="760" height="760" /><br />Here&rsquo;s another example of account metrics from a different forex trading platform:</p>
    <p><a href="https://bpcdn.co/images/2019/02/19200717/forex-margin-metrics.jpg"><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2019/02/19200717/forex-margin-metrics-780x40.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" srcset="https://bpcdn.co/images/2019/02/19200717/forex-margin-metrics-780x40.jpg 780w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2019/02/19200717/forex-margin-metrics-768x39.jpg 768w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2019/02/19200717/forex-margin-metrics-360x18.jpg 360w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2019/02/19200717/forex-margin-metrics.jpg 1151w" alt="Forex Margin Metrics" width="780" height="40" /></a></p>
    <p>Same metrics as MetaTrader 4, but different labels.</p>
    <p>Don&rsquo;t worry about the different labels right now, we&rsquo;ll explain each margin-related metric in a way that you&rsquo;ll be able to know which metric is which regardless of the exact label.</p>
    <p>We&rsquo;ll also let you know what other names that a specific metric is also known by. And at the end of this Margin Trading 101 course, we&rsquo;ll provide a helpful &ldquo;cheat sheet&rdquo; for all this margin jargon.</p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s now discuss each metric one-by-one in detail.</p>
