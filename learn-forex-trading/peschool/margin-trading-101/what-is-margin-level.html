    <p>What does &ldquo;Margin Level&rdquo; mean?</p>
    <p>The&nbsp;<strong>Margin Level</strong>&nbsp;is the percentage (%) value based on the amount of Equity versus Used Margin.</p>
    <p>Margin Level allows you to know how much of your funds are available for new trades.</p>
    <p><strong>The higher the Margin Level, the more Free Margin you have available to trade.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>The lower the Margin Level, the less Free Margin available to trade,</strong>&nbsp;which could result in something very bad&hellip;like a Margin Call or a Stop Out (which will be discussed later).</p>
    <h2>How to Calculate Margin Level</h2>
    <p>Here&rsquo;s how to calculate Margin Level::</p>
    <pre>Margin Level = (Equity / Used Margin) x 100%</pre>
    <p>Your trading platform will automatically calculate and display your Margin Level.</p>
    <p><strong>If you don&rsquo;t have any trades open, your Margin Level will be ZERO.</strong></p>
    <p>Margin Level is very important. Forex brokers use margin levels to determine whether you can open additional positions.</p>
    <p>Different brokers set different Margin Level limits, but most brokers set this limit at&nbsp;<strong>100%</strong>.</p>
    <p>This means that when your Equity is equal or less than your Used Margin, you will NOT be able to open any new positions.</p>
    <p>If you want to open new positions, you will have to close existing positions first.</p>
    <h2>Example #1: Open a long USD/JPY position with 1 mini lot</h2>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s say you have an account balance of&nbsp;<strong>$1,000</strong>.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2019/02/14125949/account-balance.png" alt="" /></p>
    <h3>Step 1: Calculate Required Margin</h3>
    <p>You want to go long USD/JPY and want to open 1 mini lot (10,000 units) position. The Margin Requirement is&nbsp;<strong>4%</strong>.</p>
    <p>How much margin (Required Margin) will you need to open the position?</p>
    <p>Since USD is the base currency. this mini lot is 10,000 dollars, which means the position&rsquo;s Notional Value is&nbsp;<strong>$10,000</strong>.</p>
    <pre>Required Margin = Notional Value x Margin Requirement
    $400 = $10,000 x .04</pre>
    <p>Assuming your trading account is denominated in USD, since the Margin Requirement is&nbsp;<strong>4%</strong>, the Required Margin will be&nbsp;<strong>$400</strong>.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Calculate Used Margin</h3>
    <p>Aside from the trade we just entered, there aren&rsquo;t any other trades open.</p>
    <p>Since we just have a single position open, the Used Margin will be the same as Required Margin.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Calculate Equity</h3>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s assume that the price has moved slightly in your favor and your position is now trading at breakeven.</p>
    <p>This means that your Floating P/L is&nbsp;<strong>$0</strong>.</p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s calculate the Equity:</p>
    <pre>Equity = Account Balance + Floating Profits (or Losses)
    $1,000 = $1,000 + $0</pre>
    <p>The Equity in your account is now&nbsp;<strong>$1,000</strong>.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2019/02/14145842/equity-with-breakeven-floating-pl.png" alt="" /></p>
    <h3>Step 4: Calculate Margin Level</h3>
    <p>Now that we know the Equity, we can now calculate the Margin Level:</p>
    <pre>Margin Level = (Equity / Used Margin) x 100%
    250% = ($1,000 / $400) x 100%</pre>
    <p>The Margin Level is&nbsp;<strong>250%</strong>.<img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2019/02/14152816/margin-level.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>If the Margin Level is 100% or less,&nbsp;<em>most</em>&nbsp;trading platforms will not allow you to open new trades.<img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2019/02/20230633/no-more-trades-diagram.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>In the example, since your current Margin Level is 250%, which is way above 100%, you&rsquo;ll still be able to open new trades.</p>
    <p>Imagine the Margin Level as being a&nbsp;<strong>traffic light.</strong><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2019/02/20230904/green-light.png" alt="" />As long as the Margin Level is above 100%, then your account has the &ldquo;green light&rdquo; to continue to open new trades.</p>
    <h2>Recap</h2>
    <p>In this lesson, we learned about the following:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Margin Level</strong>&nbsp;is the ratio between Equity and Used Margin. It is expressed as a percentage (%).</li>
    <li>For example, if your Equity is $5,000 and the Used Margin is $1,000, the Margin Level is 500%.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s move on and learn about the concept of&nbsp;<strong>Margin Call Level</strong>.</p>
