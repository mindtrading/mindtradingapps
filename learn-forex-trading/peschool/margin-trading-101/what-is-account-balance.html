    <p>What does &ldquo;Account Balance&rdquo; mean?</p>
    <p>In order to start trading forex, you need to&nbsp;<strong>open an account</strong>&nbsp;with a retail forex broker or CFD provider.</p>
    <p>Once your account is approved, then you can transfer funds into the account.</p>
    <p>This new account should only be funded with &ldquo;risk capital&rdquo;, which is&nbsp;<strong>cash you can afford to lose</strong>.<img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2019/02/12235512/need-risk-capital.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>The &ldquo;<strong>Account Balance</strong>&rdquo; or simply &ldquo;<strong>Balance</strong>&rdquo; is the starting balance of your account.</p>
    <p>Basically, it&rsquo;s the amount of&nbsp;<strong>CASH</strong>&nbsp;in your account.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2019/02/08110542/cash-in-account-150x150.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>Think of it this way:</p>
    <pre>Balance = Cash</pre>
    <p>Your Balance measures the amount of cash you have in your trading account.</p>
    <p>If you&nbsp;<em>deposit</em>&nbsp;$1,000, then your Balance is&nbsp;<strong>$1,000.</strong></p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2019/02/12234239/account-balance-deposit.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>If you enter a new trade or in trader lingo, &ldquo;<strong>open a new position</strong>&rdquo;, your account balance is not affected until the position is CLOSED.</p>
    <p>This means that your Balance will only change in one of three ways:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>When you&nbsp;<strong>add more funds</strong>&nbsp;to your account.</li>
    <li>When you&nbsp;<strong>close a position</strong>.</li>
    <li>When you keep a position open overnight and either receive or pay&nbsp;<strong>swap/rollover fee</strong>.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Since the topic&nbsp;is about margin, the concepts of swap and rollover aren&rsquo;t really related but for thoroughness, we&rsquo;ll quickly describe it since&nbsp;<strong>swap fees do affect your Balance.</strong></p>
    <p>Just know that there&rsquo;s a difference between a trade that lasts a couple of hours and a trade you keep open&nbsp;<em>overnight</em>.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2019/02/12210216/rollover.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>The procedure of moving open positions from one trading day to another is called a&nbsp;<strong>rollover</strong>.</p>
    <p>Most brokers perform the rollover&nbsp;<em>automatically</em>&nbsp;by closing any open positions at the end of the day, while simultaneously opening an identical position for the following business day.</p>
    <p>During this rollover, a&nbsp;<strong>swap</strong>&nbsp;is calculated.</p>
    <p>A swap is a&nbsp;FEE that is either&nbsp;<strong>paid or charged</strong>&nbsp;to you at the end of each trading day if you keep your trade open overnight.</p>
    <p>If you are paid swap, cash will be&nbsp;<em>added</em>&nbsp;to your Balance.</p>
    <p>If you are charged swap, cash will be&nbsp;<em>deducted</em>&nbsp;from your Balance.</p>
    <p>Unless you&rsquo;re trading huge position sizes, these swap fees are usually small but can&nbsp;<strong>add up over time.</strong></p>
    <p>In MetaTrader, you can see swaps on your open position (if you keep it open for longer than 1&nbsp;day) by opening a &ldquo;Terminal&rdquo; window and clicking on the &ldquo;Trade&rdquo; tab.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2019/02/16201717/swap-example-780x281.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>The concept of swap and rollover is beyond the scope of this lesson and will not be discussed further, but we just wanted to cover if briefly for accuracy&rsquo;s sake.</p>
    <p>Now that we know what Balance means, let&rsquo;s move on to understanding the concepts of &ldquo;Unrealized P/L&rdquo; and &ldquo;Realized P/L&rdquo; and how they&nbsp;affect your Balance.</p>
