    <p>What does &ldquo;Stop Out Level&rdquo; or &ldquo;Stop Out&rdquo; mean?</p>
    <p>The Stop Out Level is similar to the Margin Call Level, which was covered in the previous lesson, except that it&rsquo;s much worse!</p>
    <p>In forex trading, a Stop Out Level is when your&nbsp;<strong>Margin Level falls to a specific percentage (%) level</strong>&nbsp;in which one or all of your open positions are closed automatically (&ldquo;liquidated&rdquo;) by your broker.</p>
    <p>This liquidation happens because the trading account can no longer support the open positions due to a&nbsp;<strong>lack of margin</strong>.</p>
    <p>More specifically, the Stop Out Level is when the&nbsp;<strong>Equity is lower than a specific percentage of your Used Margin</strong>.</p>
    <p>If this level is reached, your broker will automatically start closing out your trades starting with the most unprofitable one until your&nbsp;<strong>Margin Level is back above the Stop Out Level.</strong>&nbsp;<img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2019/02/20232349/stop-out-level-diagram1.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>If your Margin Level is at or below the Stop Out Level, the broker will close any or all of your open positions as quickly as possible in order to&nbsp;<strong>protect you from possibly incurring further losses</strong>.</p>
    <p>This&nbsp;<em>act</em>&nbsp;of closing your positions is called a&nbsp;<strong>Stop Out</strong>.</p>
    <p>Keep in mind that a Stop Out is not discretionary. Once the&nbsp;<strong>liquidation</strong>&nbsp;process has started, it is usually not possible to stop it since the process is automated.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2019/02/20202130/trader-liquidation.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>Your broker&rsquo;s customer support team will probably NOT be able to help you aside from lending an ear while you weep loudly over the phone.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>The&nbsp;<strong>Stop Out Level</strong>&nbsp;is also known as the&nbsp;<strong>Margin Closeout Value,&nbsp;Liquidation Margin, or Minimum Required Margin.</strong></p>
    </blockquote>
    <h2>Example: Stop Out Level at 20%</h2>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s say your forex broker has a Stop Out Level at&nbsp;<strong>20%</strong>.</p>
    <p>This means that your trading platform will automatically close your position if your&nbsp;<strong>Margin Level reaches 20%</strong>.</p>
    <pre>Stop Out Level = Margin Level @ 20%</pre>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s continue with the example from the previous lesson, What is a Margin Call Level?<img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2019/02/14164444/margin-call-level-usdchf-example-floating-loss.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>You&rsquo;ve already received a&nbsp;<strong>Margin Call</strong>&nbsp;when the&nbsp;<strong>Margin Level had reached 100%</strong>&nbsp;but still decide&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;to deposit more funds because you think the market will turn.</p>
    <p>Not only are you a sucky trader, but you&rsquo;re a crazy trader also. A sucky crazy trader.</p>
    <p>Anyways, your sucky crazy self ends up&hellip;absolutely WRONG.</p>
    <p>The market continues to fall.</p>
    <p>You&rsquo;re now down&nbsp;<strong>960 pips</strong>.</p>
    <p>At $1/pip, you now have a floating loss of&nbsp;<strong>$960!</strong></p>
    <p>This means your Equity is now&nbsp;<strong>$40</strong>.</p>
    <pre>Equity = Balance + Floating P/L
    $40 = $1000 - $960</pre>
    <p>Your Margin Level is now&nbsp;<strong>20%</strong>.</p>
    <pre>Margin Level = (Equity / Used Margin) x 100%
    20% = ($40 / $200) x 100%</pre>
    <p>*Used Margin can&rsquo;t go below $200 because that&rsquo;s the Required Margin that was needed to open the position in the first place.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2019/02/14174911/stop-out-level-example.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>At this point, your position will be&nbsp;<strong>automatically closed</strong>&nbsp;(&ldquo;liquidated&rdquo;).</p>
    <p>When your position is closed, the Used Margin that was &ldquo;locked up&rdquo; will be&nbsp;<strong>released</strong>.</p>
    <p><strong>It will become Free Margin.</strong></p>
    <p>The end result for you will be depressing though.</p>
    <p>Your floating loss of $960 will be &ldquo;realized&rdquo;, and your new Balance will be&nbsp;<strong>$40</strong>!</p>
    <p>Since you don&rsquo;t have any open trades, your Equity and Free Margin will also be&nbsp;<strong>$40.</strong><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2019/02/14175433/stop-out-level-example-realized-loss.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>Here&rsquo;s how your account metrics would look like in your trading platform at each Margin Level threshold:</p>
    <div>
    <div>
    <table border="1px">
    <tbody>
    <tr>
    <td><strong>Margin Level</strong></td>
    <td><strong>Equity</strong></td>
    <td><strong>Used Margin</strong></td>
    <td><strong>Free Margin</strong></td>
    <td><strong>Balance</strong></td>
    <td><strong>Floating P/L</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><strong>Margin Call Level</strong></td>
    <td><strong>100%</strong></td>
    <td>$200</td>
    <td>$200</td>
    <td>$0</td>
    <td>$1,000</td>
    <td>-$800</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><strong>Stop Out Level</strong></td>
    <td><strong>20%</strong></td>
    <td>$40</td>
    <td>$200</td>
    <td>$0</td>
    <td>$1,000</td>
    <td>-$960</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><strong>Stop Out (Liquidation)</strong></td>
    <td>&ndash;</td>
    <td>$40</td>
    <td>&ndash;</td>
    <td>$40</td>
    <td>$40</td>
    <td>&ndash;</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>
    </div>
    </div>
    <p>If you experience a Stop Out and see the aftermath in your account, this is how your eyes feel&hellip;<img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2019/02/24234328/stop-out-trade.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>If you had multiple positions open, the broker usually closes the least profitable position first.</p>
    <p>Each position that is closed &ldquo;releases&rdquo; Used Margin, which increases your Margin Level.</p>
    <p>But if closing this position is still not enough to get back the Margin Level above 20%, your broker will continue to close positions until it does.</p>
    <p>The Stop Out Level is meant to prevent you from losing more money than you have deposited.</p>
    <p>If your trade continued to keep losing, eventually, you&rsquo;d have no more money in your account and you&rsquo;d end up with a&nbsp;<strong>negative account balance</strong>!</p>
    <p>Brokers would prefer not to have to come knocking on your door with a baseball bat to collect the unpaid balance, so a Stop Out is meant to try and&hellip; STOP&hellip; your Balance from going negative.</p>
    <h2>What if I have multiple positions open?</h2>
    <p>The example above covered the scenario with you trading a single position. But what if you had MULTIPLE positions open?</p>
    <p>Hmmm.</p>
    <p>Sounds like you love gambling so here&rsquo;s an example of how the&nbsp;liquidation process would work if you had&nbsp;<strong>two or more positions open</strong>.</p>
    <p>Each broker has its own specific liquidation process so be sure to check with yours.</p>
    <p>BUT this is a popular approach and will at least give you a good idea of what kind of horror you might experience if you&rsquo;re trading too BIG.</p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s pretend the Stop Out level is at&nbsp;<strong>100%</strong>.</p>
    <p>If at any point, the Margin Level drops below 100% of the margin required.. you will experience an&nbsp;<strong>AUTO LIQUIDATION&nbsp;</strong>of the position that has the&nbsp;<strong>largest unrealized loss!&nbsp;ðŸ˜²</strong></p>
    <p>So if you have multiple positions, the open position with the&nbsp;<strong>greatest</strong>&nbsp;unrealized loss is closed first, followed by the&nbsp;<strong>next</strong>&nbsp;largest losing position, followed by the&nbsp;<strong>next</strong>&nbsp;largest losing position, and so on, UNTIL the Margin Level (maintenance margin) is back to 100% or higher.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2019/02/15130620/auto-liquidation.jpg" alt="Liquidation" width="356" height="275" /></p>
    <p><strong>Depending on the size and unrealized P&amp;L of the open positions, all your open positions could be liquidated in order to meet the margin requirement!&nbsp;ðŸ˜²ðŸ˜²ðŸ˜²ðŸ˜²ðŸ˜²</strong></p>
    <p>Remember, YOU, and YOU&nbsp;<em>alone</em>, are responsible for monitoring your account and making sure you are maintaining the required margin at all times to support your open positions.</p>
    <p>You&rsquo;ve been warned. Don&rsquo;t be crying to your broker when your position gets auto-liquated.</p>
    <p>You can still cry of course. But only in front of a mirror.&nbsp;ðŸ˜­</p>
    <p>Now that we&rsquo;ve covered all the important metrics that you need to know in your trading platform, let&rsquo;s take everything you&rsquo;ve learned so far about margin trading and put it all together using different trading scenarios.</p>
