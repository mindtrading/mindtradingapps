    <p>What is the relationship between Margin and Leverage?</p>
    <p><strong>You use margin to&nbsp;<em>create</em>&nbsp;leverage.</strong></p>
    <p>Leverage is the increased &ldquo;trading power&rdquo; that is available when using a margin account.</p>
    <p>Leverage allows you to trade positions LARGER than the amount of money in your trading account.</p>
    <p>Leverage is expressed as a<strong>&nbsp;ratio</strong>.</p>
    <p>Leverage is the ratio between the amount of money you really have and the amount of money you can trade.</p>
    <p>It is usually expressed with an &ldquo;<strong>X:1</strong>&rdquo; format.</p>
    <p>For example, if you wanted to trade 1 standard lot of USD/JPY without margin, you would need $100,000 in your account.</p>
    <p>But with a Margin Requirement&nbsp;of just 1%, you would only have to deposit&nbsp;<strong>$1,000</strong>&nbsp;in your account.</p>
    <p>The leverage provided for this trade would be&nbsp;<strong>100:1</strong>.</p>
    <p>Here are examples of&nbsp;<strong>Leverage Ratios</strong>&nbsp;depending on the Margin Requirement:</p>
    <div>
    <div>
    <table border="1px">
    <tbody>
    <tr>
    <td><strong>Currency Pair</strong></td>
    <td><strong>Margin Requirement</strong></td>
    <td><strong>Leverage Ratio</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>EUR/USD</td>
    <td>2%</td>
    <td>50:1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>GBP/USD</td>
    <td>5%</td>
    <td>20:1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>USD/JPY</td>
    <td>4%</td>
    <td>25:1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>EUR/AUD</td>
    <td>3%</td>
    <td>33:1</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>
    </div>
    </div>
    <p>Here&rsquo;s how to calculate&nbsp;<strong>Leverage</strong>:</p>
    <pre>Leverage = 1 / Margin Requirement</pre>
    <p>For example, if the&nbsp;<strong>Margin Requirement is 2%</strong>, here&rsquo;s how to calculate leverage:</p>
    <pre>50 = 1 / .02</pre>
    <p>The leverage is 50, which is expressed as a ratio,&nbsp;<strong>50:1</strong></p>
    <p>Here&rsquo;s how to calculate the Margin Requirement based on the Leverage Ratio:</p>
    <pre>Margin Requirement = 1 / Leverage Ratio</pre>
    <p>For example, if the&nbsp;<strong>Leverage Ratio is 100:1</strong>, here&rsquo;s how to calculate the Margin Requirement.</p>
    <pre>0.01 = 1 / 100</pre>
    <p>The Margin Requirement is 0.01 or&nbsp;<strong>1%</strong>.</p>
    <p>As you can see,&nbsp;<strong>leverage has an inverse relationship to margin</strong>.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Leverage&rdquo; and &ldquo;margin&rdquo; refer to the same concept, just from a slightly different angle.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>When a trader opens a position, they are required to put up a fraction of that position&rsquo;s value &ldquo;in good faith&rdquo;. In this case, the trader is said to be &ldquo;<strong>leveraged</strong>&rdquo;.</p>
    <p>The &ldquo;fraction&rdquo; part which is expressed in percentage terms is known as the &ldquo;<strong>Margin Requirement</strong>&rdquo;. For example,&nbsp;<strong>2%</strong>.</p>
    <p>The actual&nbsp;<em>amount</em>&nbsp;that is required to be put up is known as the &ldquo;<strong>Required Margin</strong>&rdquo;.</p>
    <p>For example, 2% of a $100,000 position size would be&nbsp;<strong>$2,000.</strong></p>
    <p>The $2,000 is the Required Margin to open this specific position.</p>
    <p>Since you are able to trade a $100,000 position size with just $2,000, your leverage ratio is&nbsp;<strong>50:1</strong>.</p>
    <pre>Leverage = 1 /Margin Requirement
    50 = 1 / 0.02</pre>

    <p><strong>Forex Margin vs. Securities Margin</strong></p>
    <p>Forex margin and securities margin are two very different things. Understanding the difference is important.</p>
    <p>In the securities world, margin is the money you&nbsp;<strong>borrow</strong>&nbsp;as a partial down payment, usually up to 50% of the purchase price, to buy and own a stock, bond, or ETF.</p>
    <p>This practice is often referred to as &ldquo;<strong>buying on margin&rdquo;</strong>.</p>
    <p>So if you&rsquo;re trading stocks on margin, you&rsquo;re borrowing money from your stockbroker to purchase stock. Basically, a&nbsp;<strong>loan</strong>&nbsp;from the brokerage firm.</p>
    <p>In the forex market, margin is the amount of money that you must deposit and keep on hand with your trading platform when you open a position.</p>
    <p>It is NOT a down payment and you do NOT own the underlying currency pair.</p>
    <p>Margin can be looked at as a&nbsp;<strong>good faith deposit</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>collateral</strong>&nbsp;that&rsquo;s used to ensure each party (buyer and seller) can meet their obligations of the agreement.</p>
    <p>Unlike margin in stock trading, margin<strong>&nbsp;in forex trading is not borrowed money</strong>.</p>
    <p>When trading forex, nothing is actually being bought or sold, only the&nbsp;<strong>agreement</strong>&nbsp;(or contract) to buy or sell are exchanged, so borrowing is not needed.</p>
    <p>The term &ldquo;margin&rdquo; is used across multiple financial markets. However, there is a difference between how margin is used when trading securities versus when trading forex. Understanding this difference is essential prior to trading forex.</p>
