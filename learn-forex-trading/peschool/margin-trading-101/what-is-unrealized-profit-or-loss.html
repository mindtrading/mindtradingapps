    <p>In your trading platform, you will see something that says &ldquo;Unrealized P/L&rdquo; or &ldquo;Floating P/L&rdquo; with&nbsp;<strong>green</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>red</strong>&nbsp;numbers beside them.</p>
    <p>In this lesson, we explain what Unrealized P/L and Floating P/L are.</p>
    <p>When trading, there are actually two different types of &ldquo;<strong>profit or loss</strong>&rdquo;, also known as &ldquo;<strong>P/L</strong>&rdquo;.</p>
    <p>Both are important. Let&rsquo;s discuss the difference between the two.</p>
    <h2>Unrealized P/L</h2>
    <p><strong>Unrealized P/L</strong>&nbsp;refers to the profit or loss held in your current open positions&hellip;.your currently active trades.</p>
    <p>This is equal to the profit or loss that would be &ldquo;realized&rdquo; if all your open positions were closed&nbsp;<em>immediately</em>.</p>
    <p>Unrealized P/L is also known as &ldquo;<strong>Floating P/L</strong>&rdquo; because the value is constantly changing since your positions are still open.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2019/02/13150940/floating-profit-and-loss.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>Your unrealized P/L continuously fluctuates (or &ldquo;floats&rdquo;) with the current market prices if you have open positions.</p>
    <p>For example, if you currently have an unrealized profit, if price move against you, the unrealized profit can become an unrealized loss.</p>
    <h3>Example: Floating Loss</h3>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s say your account is in USD and you are currently&nbsp;<strong>long</strong>&nbsp;10,000 units EUR/USD, which was bought at&nbsp;<strong>1.15000</strong>.</p>
    <p>The current exchange rate for EUR/USD is&nbsp;<strong>1.13000</strong>.</p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s calculate the position&rsquo;s Floating P/L:</p>
    <pre>Floating P/L = Position Size x (Current Price - Entry Price)
    Floating P/L = 10,000 x (1.13000 - 1.15000)
    -200 = 10,000 x (- 0.0200)
    </pre>
    <p>The position is&nbsp;<em>down</em>&nbsp;<strong>200 pips</strong>.</p>
    <p>Since you&rsquo;re trading a mini lot, each pip is worth $1.</p>
    <p>So you currently have a&nbsp;<strong>Floating Loss of $200</strong>&nbsp;(200 pips x $1).</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2019/02/13154228/floating-profit-and-loss-and-balance.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>It is a Floating Loss because you have NOT closed the trade yet.</p>
    <p>Usually, when a loss remains floating, you are hoping that the price will turn around.</p>
    <p>If EUR/USD rose above your original entry price to<strong>&nbsp;1.16000</strong>, then you would now have a Floating Profit.</p>
    <p>The position is now up&nbsp;<strong>100 pips</strong>.</p>
    <p>Since you&rsquo;re trading a mini lot, each pip is worth $1.</p>
    <p>So you currently have a&nbsp;<strong>Floating Profit of $100</strong>&nbsp;(100 pips x $1).</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2019/02/13154601/floating-profit-and-balance.png" alt="" /></p>
    <h2>Realized P/L</h2>
    <p>A&nbsp;<strong>Realized Profit</strong>&nbsp;is profit that comes from a completed trade.</p>
    <p>Same thing with a loss.</p>
    <p>A&nbsp;<strong>Realized Loss</strong>&nbsp;is a loss that comes from a completed trade.</p>
    <p>In other words, your profits or losses only become&nbsp;<em>realized</em>&nbsp;when the positions are CLOSED.</p>
    <p><strong>This is the only time when your account balance will change to reflect any gains or losses.</strong></p>
    <p>If you closed a position with profits, your account balance will&nbsp;<em>increase</em>. If you closed with losses, then your account balance will&nbsp;<em>decrease</em>.</p>
    <h3>Example: Realized Loss</h3>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s say your account is in USD and you are currently&nbsp;<strong>long</strong>&nbsp;10,000 units of EUR/USD, which was bought at&nbsp;<strong>1.15000.</strong></p>
    <p>The current exchange rate for EUR/USD is&nbsp;<strong>1.13000</strong>.</p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s calculate the position&rsquo;s Floating P/L:</p>
    <pre>Floating P/L = Position Size x (Current Price - Entry Price)
    Floating P/L = 10,000 x (1.13000 - 1.15000)
    -200 = 10,000 x (- 0.0200)
    </pre>
    <p>The position is&nbsp;<em>down</em>&nbsp;<strong>200 pips</strong>.</p>
    <p>And since you&rsquo;re trading a mini lot, each pip is worth $1.</p>
    <p>So you currently have a&nbsp;<strong>Floating Loss of $200</strong>&nbsp;(200 pips x $1).<img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2019/02/13154228/floating-profit-and-loss-and-balance.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>It is a floating loss because you have NOT closed the trade yet.</p>
    <p>But you can&rsquo;t stomach losing anymore and decide to close the trade right then and there.<img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2019/02/13162213/realized-loss-example.png" alt="" />You&rsquo;ve&nbsp;<strong><em>realized</em>&nbsp;the $200 loss</strong>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<strong>cash is&nbsp;<em>DEDUCTED</em>&nbsp;from your account balance</strong>.</p>
    <p>When you opened the trade, you had&nbsp;<strong>$1,000</strong>&nbsp;as your Balance.</p>
    <p>But after you closed the trade with a&nbsp;<strong>$200 loss</strong>, your Balance is now&nbsp;<strong>$800</strong>.</p>

    <p>You&rsquo;ve&nbsp;<strong><em>realized</em>&nbsp;the $100 gain</strong>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<strong>cash is ADDED to your account balance.</strong></p>

    <p>But after you closed the trade with a&nbsp;<strong>$100 gain</strong>, your Balance is now&nbsp;<strong>$1,100.</strong></p>

    <h2>Profit Isn&rsquo;t Real Until It&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Realized</em></h2>
    <p>The difference between realized and unrealized profit is subtle, but it can mean the difference between a profitable trade or a losing trade.</p>
    <p>It is important for traders to clearly know how to differentiate between &ldquo;realized&rdquo; P/L and &ldquo;unrealized&rdquo; P/L</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Realized profits are gains that have been&nbsp;<strong>converted into cash and ADDED to your account balance</strong>.</li>
    <li>Realized losses are losses that have been&nbsp;<strong>converted into cash and DEDUCTED from your account balance</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In other words, for you to realize profits from a trade you&rsquo;ve made, you must&nbsp;<strong>receive cash</strong>&nbsp;and not simply observe the value of your trade increase without exiting the trade.</p>
    <p>Unrealized profit is&nbsp;<strong>theoretical profit</strong>&nbsp;or &ldquo;paper profit&rdquo; that is currently available, but&nbsp;<strong>could be taken away at any moment</strong>&nbsp;if the price moves against the trade.</p>
    <p>When it comes to love, think about &ldquo;the one&rdquo; that got away.</p>
    <p>At one point in your life, he or she was an &ldquo;unrealized&rdquo; spouse.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2019/02/13022955/the-one-that-got-away.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>You never built up the courage to pop the question and now you&rsquo;re forever heartbroken with a &ldquo;realized&rdquo; loss of the perfect spouse.</p>
    <p>This is exactly what happened to Bob.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2019/02/12231124/bob-the-forex-trader.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>To this day, Bob is&nbsp;<em>still</em>&nbsp;single.</p>
    <p>This depressing life lesson from Bob&rsquo;s sad love story can be applied to trading.</p>
    <p>If you have not closed out of your position and &ldquo;realized&rdquo; your gain, you could still lose some, or all, of your profits.</p>
    <p><strong>Realized profit is real profit</strong>&nbsp;that can no longer be affected by price changes because it is no longer part of an active trade.</p>
    <p>It is real money that is added to your Balance and can be withdrawn from your trading account and transferred into your bank account.</p>
    <h2>Recap</h2>
    <p>In this lesson, we learned about the following:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Unrealized P/L</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>Floating P/L</strong>&nbsp;refers to the profit or loss held in your current open positions&hellip;.your currently active trades.</li>
    <li><strong>Realized P/L&nbsp;</strong>refers to profit or loss from a completed trade.</li>
    </ul>
