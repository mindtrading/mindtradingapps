    <p>It&rsquo;s not just the stock market. The forex market also boasts of a bunch of advantages over the futures market, similar to its advantages over stocks.</p>
    <p>But wait, there&rsquo;s more&hellip; So much more!</p>
    <h2>Liquidity</h2>
    <div><img title="Forex vs. Futures" src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/pre-school-forex-vs-futures.png" alt="Forex vs. Futures" width="250" height="294" border="0" />
    <p>&ldquo;Mr. Futures, our short shorts look cool!&rdquo;</p>
    </div>
    <p>In the forex market, $6.6 trillion is traded daily, making it the largest and most liquid market in the world.</p>
    <p>This market can absorb trading volume and transaction sizes that dwarf the capacity of any other market.</p>
    <p>The futures market trades a puny $30 billion per day. Thirty billion? Peanuts!</p>
    <p>The futures markets can&rsquo;t compete with its relatively limited liquidity.</p>
    <p>The forex market is always liquid, meaning positions can be liquidated and stop orders executed with little or no slippage, with exception to extremely volatile market conditions.</p>
    <h2>24-Hour Market</h2>
    <p>At 5:00 pm EST Sunday, trading begins as markets open in Sydney.</p>
    <p>At 7:00 pm EST the Tokyo market opens, followed by London at 3:00 am EST.</p>
    <p>And finally, New York opens at 8:00 am EST and closes at 4:00 p.m. EST.</p>
    <p>Before New York trading closes, the Sydney market is back open &ndash; it&rsquo;s a 24-hour seamless market!</p>
    <p>As a trader, this allows you to react to favorable or unfavorable news by trading immediately.</p>
    <p>If important data comes in from the United Kingdom or Japan while the U.S. futures market is closed, the next day&rsquo;s opening could be a wild ride.</p>
    <p>Overnight markets in futures contracts do exist, and while liquidity is improving, they are still&nbsp;thinly traded relative to the spot forex market.</p>
    <h2>Minimal or no commissions</h2>
    <p>With Electronic Communications Brokers becoming more popular and prevalent over the past couple of years, there is the chance that a broker may require you to pay commissions.</p>
    <p>But really, the commission fees are peanuts compared to what you pay in the futures market.</p>
    <p>The competition among spot forex brokers is so fierce that you will most likely get the best quotes and very low transaction costs.</p>
    <h2>Price Certainty</h2>
    <p>When trading forex, you get rapid execution and price certainty under normal market conditions. In contrast, the futures and equities markets do not offer price certainty or instant trade execution.</p>
    <p>Even with the advent of electronic trading and limited guarantees of execution speed, the prices for fills for futures and equities on market orders are far from certain.</p>
    <p>The prices quoted by brokers often represent the LAST trade, not necessarily the price for which the contract will be filled.</p>
    <h2>Guaranteed Limited Risk</h2>
    <p>Traders must have position limits for the purpose of risk management. This number is set relative to the money in a trader&rsquo;s account.</p>
    <p>Risk is minimized in the spot forex market because the online capabilities of the trading platform will automatically generate a margin call if the required margin amount exceeds the available trading capital in your account.</p>
    <p>During normal market conditions, all open positions will be closed immediately (during fast market conditions, your position could be closed beyond your stop loss level).</p>
    <p>In the futures market, your position may be liquidated at a loss bigger than what you had in your account, and you will be liable for any resulting deficit in the account. That sucks.</p>
