    <p>There are many benefits and advantages of trading forex.</p>
    <p>Here are just a few reasons why so many people are choosing this market:</p>
    <h2>No commissions</h2>
    <p>No clearing fees, no exchange fees, no government fees, no brokerage fees. Most retail forex brokers are compensated for their services through something called the &ldquo;spread&ldquo;.</p>
    <h2>No fixed lot size</h2>
    <p>In the futures markets, lot or contract sizes are determined by the exchanges. For example, a standard-sized contract for silver futures is 5,000 ounces.</p>
    <p>In forex, you can trade smaller&nbsp;lot&nbsp;sizes, or position size. This allows traders to&nbsp;open trades as small as 1,000 units.</p>
    <h2>Low transaction costs</h2>
    <p>The retail transaction cost (the bid/ask spread) is typically less than 0.1% under normal market conditions.</p>
    <p>For larger transactions, the spread could be as low as 0.07%. Of course, this depends on your leverage, and all that will be explained later.</p>
    <h2>A 24-hour market</h2>
    <p>There is no waiting for the opening bell. From the Monday morning opening in Australia to the Friday afternoon close in New York, the forex market never sleeps.</p>
    <p>This is awesome for those who want to trade on a part-time basis because you can choose when you want to trade: morning, noon, night, during breakfast, or in your sleep.</p>
    <h2>No one can corner the market</h2>
    <p>The FX market is sufficiently liquid that significant manipulation by any single entity is all but impossible during active trading hours for the major currencies.</p>
    <p>The foreign exchange market is so huge and has so many participants that no single entity (not even a central bank or the mighty Chuck Norris himself) can control the market price for an&nbsp;<em>extended</em>&nbsp;period of time.</p>
    <h2>Leverage</h2>
    <p>In forex trading, a small deposit can control a much larger total contract value. Leverage gives the trader the ability to make nice profits, and at the same time keep risk capital to a minimum.</p>
    <p>For example, a forex broker may offer 50-to-1 leverage, which means that a $50 dollar margin deposit would enable a trader to buy or sell $2,500 worth of currencies. Similarly, with $500 dollars, one could trade with $25,000 dollars and so on.</p>
    <p>While this is all gravy, let&rsquo;s remember that leverage is a double-edged sword. Without proper risk management, this high degree of leverage can lead to large losses as well as gains.</p>
    <h2>Deep Liquidity</h2>
    <p>Because the forex market is so enormous, it is also extremely liquid. This is an advantage because it means that under normal market conditions, with a click of a mouse, you can instantaneously buy and sell at will.</p>
    <p>You are never &ldquo;stuck&rdquo; in a trade. You can even set your online trading platform to automatically close your position once your desired profit level (a limit order) has been reached, and/or close a trade if a trade is going against you (a stop loss order).</p>
    <h2>Low Barriers to Entry</h2>
    <p>You would think that getting started as a currency trader would cost a ton of money. The fact is, when compared to trading stocks, options, or futures, it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
    <p>Online forex brokers offer &ldquo;mini&rdquo; and &ldquo;micro&rdquo; trading accounts, some with a minimum account deposit of $50.</p>
    <p><strong>We are NOT saying you should open an account with the bare minimum</strong>, but it does make forex trading much more accessible to the average individual who doesn&rsquo;t have a lot of start-up trading capital.</p>
    <h2>Free Stuff Everywhere!</h2>
    <p>Most online forex brokers offer &ldquo;demo&rdquo; accounts to practice trading and build your skills, along with real-time forex news and charting services.</p>
    <p>And guess what?! They&rsquo;re all free!</p>
    <p>Demo accounts are very valuable resources for those who are &ldquo;financially hampered&rdquo; and would like to hone their trading skills with &ldquo;play money&rdquo; before opening a live trading account and risking real money.</p>
    <p>Now that you know the advantages of the forex market, see how it compares with the stock market!</p>
