    <p>There are approximately 2,400+ stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Another 3,900+ are listed on the NASDAQ.</p>
    <p>Which one will you trade? Got the time to stay on top of so many companies?</p>
    <p>With forex, there are dozens of currencies traded, but the majority of market players trade the seven major pairs.</p>
    <p>Aren&rsquo;t seven major pairs much easier to keep an eye on than thousands of stocks?</p>
    <p><img title="Forex vs. Stocks" src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/pre-school-forex-vs-stocks.png" alt="Forex vs. Stocks" width="525" height="317" border="0" />Look at Mr. Forex. He&rsquo;s so confident and sexy. Mr. Stocks has no chance!</p>
    <p>That&rsquo;s just one of the many advantages of the forex market over the stock markets. Here are a few more:</p>
    <h2>24-Hour Market</h2>
    <p>The stock market is limited to an exchange&rsquo;s opening hours.</p>
    <p>For example, in the U.S., most stock exchanges open at 9:30 am EST and close at 4:00 pm EST.</p>
    <p>The forex market is a seamless 24-hour market.</p>
    <p>Most brokers are open from Sunday at 5:00 pm EST until Friday at 5:00 pm EST, with customer service usually available 24/7.</p>
    <p>With the ability to trade during the U.S., Asian, and European market hours, you can customize your own trading schedule.</p>
    <h2>Minimal or No Commissions</h2>
    <p>Thanks to Robinhood, a lot of online stock brokers now offer zero commissions, this is now less of a factor.</p>
    <p>Most forex brokers charge no commission or additional transaction fees to trade currencies online or over the phone.</p>
    <p>Combined with the tight, consistent, and fully transparent spread, forex trading costs are lower than those of any other market.</p>
    <p>Most brokers are compensated for their services through the bid/ask spread.</p>
    <h2>Higher Trading Volume and Liquidity</h2>
    <p>The forex market sees an average daily turnover of $6.6 trillion.</p>
    <p>The stock market sees a fraction of this.</p>
    <h2>Short-Selling without an Uptick</h2>
    <p>Unlike the equity market, there is no restriction on short selling in the currency market.</p>
    <p>Trading opportunities exist in the currency market regardless of whether a trader is long OR short, or whichever way the market is moving.</p>
    <p>Since currency trading always involves buying one currency and selling another, there is no directional bias to the market. So you always have equal access to trade in a rising or falling market.</p>
    <h2>Minimal Market Manipulation</h2>
    <p>How many times have you heard that &ldquo;Fund A&rdquo; was selling &ldquo;X&rdquo; or buying &ldquo;Z&rdquo;? The stock market is very susceptible to large fund buying and selling.</p>
    <p>With currency trading, the massive size of the forex market makes the likelihood of any one fund or bank controlling a particular currency very small.</p>
    <p>The FX market is sufficiently liquid that significant manipulation by any single entity is all but impossible during active trading hours for the major currencies.</p>
    <p>Banks, hedge funds, governments, retail currency conversion houses, and large net worth individuals are just some of the participants in the spot currency markets where the liquidity is unprecedented.</p>
    <h2>Analysts and brokerage firms are less likely to influence the market</h2>
    <p>Have you watched TV lately?</p>
    <p>Heard about a certain Internet stock and an analyst of a prestigious brokerage firm accused of keeping its recommendations, such as &ldquo;buy,&rdquo; when the stock was rapidly declining?</p>
    <p>It is the nature of these relationships. No matter what the government does to step in and discourage this type of activity, we have not heard the last of it.</p>
    <p>IPOs (and SPACs) are big business for both the companies going public and the brokerage houses.</p>
    <p>Relationships are mutually beneficial and analysts work for the brokerage houses that need the companies as clients. That catch-22 will never disappear.</p>
    <p>Foreign exchange, as the prime market, generates billions in revenue for the world&rsquo;s banks and is a necessity of the global markets. Analysts in foreign exchange have very little effect on exchange rates; they just analyze the forex market.</p>
