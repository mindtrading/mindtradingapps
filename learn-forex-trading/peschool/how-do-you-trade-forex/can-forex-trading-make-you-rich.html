    <p>Before we go any further, we are going to be 100% honest with you and tell you the following before you consider trading currencies:</p>
    <h2>1. All forex traders, and we do mean ALL traders, LOSE money on some trades.</h2>
    <p><img title="Forex Is Not A Get Rich Quick Scheme!" src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/pre-school-splat.png" alt="Forex Is Not A Get Rich Quick Scheme!" width="300" height="294" />Ninety percent of traders lose money, largely due to lack of planning, training, discipline, not having a trading edge and having poor money management rules.</p>
    <p>If you hate to lose or are a super perfectionist, you&rsquo;ll also probably have a hard time adjusting to trading because all traders lose a trade at some point or another.</p>
    <h2>2. Trading forex is not for the unemployed, those on low incomes, are knee-deep in credit card debt or who can&rsquo;t afford to pay their electricity bill or afford to eat.</h2>
    <p><a href="https://bpcdn.co/images/2011/03/02210502/poor-forex-trader.png"><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2011/03/02210502/poor-forex-trader.png" sizes="(max-width: 1254px) 100vw, 1254px" srcset="https://bpcdn.co/images/2011/03/02210502/poor-forex-trader.png 1254w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2011/03/02210502/poor-forex-trader-768x928.png 768w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2011/03/02210502/poor-forex-trader-1200x1450.png 1200w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2011/03/02210502/poor-forex-trader-298x360.png 298w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2011/03/02210502/poor-forex-trader-646x780.png 646w" alt="Poor New Forex Trader" width="1254" height="1515" /></a></p>
    <p>You should have at least $10,000 of trading capital (in a mini account) that you can afford to lose.</p>
    <p>Don&rsquo;t expect to start an account with a few hundred dollars and expect to become a gazillionaire.</p>
    <p>The forex market is one of the most popular markets for speculation, due to its enormous size, liquidity, and the tendency for currencies to move in strong trends.</p>
    <p>You would think traders all over the world would make a killing, but success has been limited to a very small percentage of traders.</p>
    <p>The problem is that many traders come with the misguided hope of making a gazillion bucks, but in reality, they&nbsp;<strong>lack the discipline required for really learning the art of trading</strong>.</p>
    <p>Most people usually lack the discipline to stick to a diet or to go to the gym three times a week.</p>
    <p>If you can&rsquo;t even do that, how do you think you&rsquo;re going to succeed one of the most difficult, but financially rewarding, endeavors known to man (and woman)?</p>
    <p>Short term trading IS NOT for amateurs, and it is rarely the path to &ldquo;get rich quick&rdquo;. You can&rsquo;t make gigantic profits without taking gigantic risks.</p>
    <p>A trading strategy that involves taking a massive degree of risk means suffering inconsistent trading performance and large losses.</p>
    <p>A trader who does this probably doesn&rsquo;t even have a trading strategy &ndash; unless you call gambling a trading strategy!</p>
    <h2>Forex Trading is NOT a Get-Rich-Quick Scheme</h2>
    <p><strong>Forex trading is a SKILL that takes TIME to learn.</strong></p>
    <p>Skilled traders can and do make money in this field. However, like any other occupation or career, success doesn&rsquo;t just happen overnight.</p>
    <p>Forex trading isn&rsquo;t a piece of cake (as some people would like you to believe).</p>
    <p>Think about it, if it was, everyone trading would already be millionaires.</p>
    <p>The truth is that even expert traders with years of experience still encounter periodic losses.</p>
    <p>Drill this in your head: there are NO shortcuts to forex trading.</p>
    <p>It takes lots and lots of&nbsp;<strong>PRACTICE</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>EXPERIENCE</strong>&nbsp;to master.</p>
    <p>There is no substitute for hard work, deliberate practice, and diligence.</p>
    <p>Practice trading on a&nbsp;<strong>DEMO ACCOUNT</strong>&nbsp;until you find a method that you know inside and out, and can comfortably execute objectively. Basically, find the way that works for you!!!</p>
