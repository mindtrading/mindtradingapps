    <p>As in any new skill that you learn, you need to learn the lingo&hellip; especially if you wish to win your love&rsquo;s heart.</p>
    <p>You, the newbie, must know certain terms like the back of your hand before making your first trade.</p>
    <p>Some of these terms you&rsquo;ve already learned, but it never hurts to do a little review.</p>
    <p><img title="Forex Lingo" src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/pre-school-how-big-is-your-leverage.png" alt="Forex Lingo" width="500" height="220" border="0" /></p>
    <h2>Major and Minor Currencies</h2>
    <p>The eight most frequently traded currencies (USD, EUR, JPY, GBP, CHF, CAD, NZD, and AUD) are called the major currencies or the &ldquo;<strong>majors</strong>.&rdquo; These are the most liquid and the most sexy.</p>
    <p>All other currencies are referred to as minor currencies.</p>
    <h2>Base Currency</h2>
    <p>The&nbsp;base currency&nbsp;is the first currency in any currency pair. The currency quote shows how much the base currency is worth as measured against the second currency.</p>
    <p>For example, if the USD/CHF rate equals 1.6350, then one USD is worth CHF 1.6350.</p>
    <p>In the forex market, the U.S. dollar is normally considered the &ldquo;base&rdquo; currency for quotes, meaning that quotes are expressed as a unit of 1 USD per the other currency quoted in the pair.</p>
    <p>The primary exceptions to this rule are the British pound, the euro, and the Australian and New Zealand dollar.</p>
    <h2>Quote Currency</h2>
    <p>The quote currency&nbsp;is the second currency in any currency pair. This is frequently called the pip currency and any unrealized profit or loss is expressed in this currency.</p>
    <h2>Pip</h2>
    <p>A pip is the smallest unit of price for any currency.</p>
    <p>Nearly all currency pairs consist of five significant digits and most pairs have the decimal point immediately after the first digit, that is, EUR/USD equals 1.2538.</p>
    <p>In this instance, a single pip equals the smallest change in the fourth decimal place &ndash; that is, 0.0001.</p>
    <p>Therefore, if the quote currency in any pair is USD, then one pip always equals 1/100 of a cent.</p>
    <p>Notable exceptions are pairs that include the Japanese yen where a pip equals 0.01.</p>
    <h2>Pipette</h2>
    <p>One-tenth of a&nbsp;pip. Some brokers quote fractional pips, or pipettes, for added precision in quoting rates.</p>
    <p>For example, if EUR/USD moved from 1.32156 to 1.32158, it moved 2 pipettes.</p>
    <h2>Bid Price</h2>
    <p>The bid is the price at which the market is prepared to buy a specific currency pair in the forex market.</p>
    <p>At this price, the trader can sell the base currency. It is shown on the left side of the quotation.</p>
    <p>For example, in the quote GBP/USD 1.8812/15, the bid price is 1.8812. This means you sell one British pound for 1.8812 U.S. dollars.</p>
    <h2>Ask/Offer Price</h2>
    <p>The ask/offer is the price at which the market is prepared to sell a specific currency pair in the forex market.</p>
    <p>At this price, you can buy the base currency. It is shown on the right side of the quotation.</p>
    <p>For example, in the quote EUR/USD 1.2812/15, the ask price is 1.2815. This means you can buy one euro for 1.2815 U.S. dollars.</p>
    <p>The ask price is also known as the offer price.</p>
    <h2>Bid-Ask Spread</h2>
    <p>The spread is the difference between the bid and ask price.</p>
    <p>The &ldquo;big figure quote&rdquo; is the dealer expression referring to the first few digits of an exchange rate.</p>
    <p>These digits are often omitted in dealer quotes.</p>
    <p>For example, the USD/JPY rate might be 118.30/118.34, but would be quoted verbally without the first three digits as &ldquo;30/34.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>In this example, USD/JPY has a 4-pip spread.</p>
    <h2>Quote Convention</h2>
    <p>Exchange rates in the forex market are expressed using the following format:</p>
    <p>Base currency / Quote currency = Bid / Ask</p>
    <h2>Transaction Cost</h2>
    <p>The critical characteristic of the bid/ask spread is that it is also the transaction cost for a round-turn trade.</p>
    <p><strong>Round-turn</strong>&nbsp;means a buy (or sell) trade and an offsetting sell (or buy) trade of the same size in the same currency pair.</p>
    <p>For example, in the case of the EUR/USD rate of 1.2812/15, the transaction cost is three pips.</p>
    <p>The formula for calculating the transaction cost is:</p>
    <p>Transaction cost (spread) = Ask Price &ndash; Bid Price</p>
    <h2>Cross Currency</h2>
    <p>A cross-currency is any currency pair&nbsp;in which neither currency is the U.S. dollar.</p>
    <p>These pairs exhibit erratic price behavior since the trader has, in effect, initiated two USD trades.</p>
    <p>For example, initiating a long (buy) EUR/GBP is equivalent to buying a EUR/USD currency pair and selling GBP/USD.</p>
    <p>Cross-currency pairs frequently carry a higher transaction cost.</p>
    <h2>Margin</h2>
    <p>When you open a new margin account with a forex broker, you must deposit a minimum amount with that broker.</p>
    <p>This minimum varies from broker to broker and can be as low as $100 to as high as $100,000.</p>
    <p>Each time you execute a new trade, a certain percentage of the account balance in the margin account will be set aside as the initial margin requirement for the new trade.</p>
    <p>The amount is based upon the underlying currency pair, its current price, and the number of units (or lots) traded. The lot size always refers to the base currency.</p>
    <p>For example, let&rsquo;s say you open a mini account that provides a 200:1 leverage or 0.5% margin. Mini accounts trade mini lots. Let&rsquo;s say one mini lot equals $10,000.</p>
    <p>If you were to open one mini-lot, instead of having to provide the full $10,000, you would only need $50 ($10,000 x 0.5% = $50).</p>
    <h2>Leverage</h2>
    <p>Leverage is the ratio of the amount capital used in a transaction to the required security deposit ( the &ldquo;margin&ldquo;).</p>
    <p>It is the ability to control large dollar amounts of a financial instrument with a relatively small amount of capital.</p>
    <p>Leverage varies dramatically with different brokers, ranging from 2:1 to 500:1.</p>
    <p>Now that you&rsquo;ve impressed your dates with your forex lingo, how about showing them the different types of trade orders?</p>
