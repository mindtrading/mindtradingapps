    <p>You can open a demo account for FREE with most forex brokers. These &ldquo;pretend&rdquo; accounts have&nbsp;<em>most</em>&nbsp;of the&nbsp;capabilities of a &ldquo;real&rdquo; account.</p>
    <p>But why is it free?</p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s because the broker wants you to learn the ins and outs of their trading platform, and have a good time trading without risk, so you&rsquo;ll fall in love with them and deposit real money.</p>
    <p>The demo account allows you to learn about the mechanics of forex trading and&nbsp;test your trading skills and processes with ZERO risk.</p>
    <p>Yes, that&rsquo;s right, ZERO!</p>
    <p>YOU SHOULD&nbsp;<strong>DEMO TRADE</strong>&nbsp;UNTIL YOU DEVELOP A SOLID, PROFITABLE SYSTEM BEFORE YOU EVEN THINK ABOUT PUTTING REAL MONEY ON THE LINE.</p>
    <p>WE REPEAT&hellip;</p>
    <p>YOU SHOULD&nbsp;<strong>DEMO TRADE</strong>&nbsp;UNTIL YOU DEVELOP A SOLID, PROFITABLE SYSTEM BEFORE YOU EVEN THINK ABOUT PUTTING REAL MONEY ON THE LINE.</p>

    <h2>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Lose Your Money&rdquo; Declaration</h2>
    <p>Now, place your hand on your heart and say&hellip;</p>
    <p><strong>&ldquo;I will demo trade until I develop a solid, profitable system before I trade with real money.&rdquo;</strong></p>
    <p>Now touch your head with your index finger and say&hellip;</p>
    <p><strong>&ldquo;I am a smart and patient forex trader!&rdquo;</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Do NOT open a live trading account until you are CONSISTENTLY trading PROFITABLY on a demo account.</strong></p>
    <p>If you can&rsquo;t wait until you&rsquo;re profitable on a demo account, then there&rsquo;s very little chance you&rsquo;ll be profitable live when real money and emotions are factored in.</p>
    <p>You&rsquo;re probably thinking, &ldquo;Sooooo&hellip;what I hear you saying is&hellip;there&rsquo;s still a chance then?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>If you&rsquo;re that impatient, then at least try to demo trade for at least a MONTH.</p>
    <p>You can hold off losing all your money for a month riiight?</p>
    <p>If you can&rsquo;t, just donate that money to your favorite charity or&nbsp;give it to your mama&hellip;show her you still care.</p>
    <p>Even after reading this, you&rsquo;re probably still NOT going to demo trade for at least a month since you&rsquo;re stubborn like that.</p>
    <p>But at least we tried. ðŸ˜‘</p>
    <h2>Concentrate on ONE major currency pair.</h2>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2011/03/04150741/concentrate-on-dollar.png" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" srcset="https://bpcdn.co/images/2011/03/04150741/concentrate-on-dollar.png 700w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2011/03/04150741/concentrate-on-dollar-285x360.png 285w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2011/03/04150741/concentrate-on-dollar-617x780.png 617w" alt="Concentrate on Dollar" width="700" height="885" />It gets far too complicated to keep tabs on more than one currency pair when you first start demo trading.</p>
    <p>Stick with ONE of the majors because they are the most liquid which usually means tighter spreads and less chance of slippage.</p>
    <p>Plus, in the beginning, you need time to&nbsp;<strong>focus on improving your trading processes</strong>&nbsp;and creating good habits.</p>
    <p>You&rsquo;ll also need to experience different market environments and learn how to adjust your methods and strategies as market behavior changes.</p>
    <p>You can be a winner at currency trading, but as with all other aspects of life, it will take hard work, dedication, a little luck, and a whole lot of patience and good judgment.</p>
