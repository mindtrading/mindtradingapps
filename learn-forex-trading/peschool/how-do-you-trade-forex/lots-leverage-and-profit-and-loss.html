    <p>Forex is commonly traded in specific amounts called&nbsp;<strong>lots,&nbsp;</strong>orbasically the number of currency units you will buy or sell.</p>
    <p>A &ldquo;<strong>lot&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;is a unit measuring a transaction amount.</p>
    <p>When you place orders on your trading platform, orders are placed in sizes quoted in lots.</p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s like an&nbsp;<strong>egg carton</strong>&nbsp;(or&nbsp;<strong>egg box</strong>&nbsp;in British English). When you buy eggs, you usually buy a carton (or box). One carton includes 12 eggs.</p>
    <p>The&nbsp;<strong>standard</strong>&nbsp;size for a lot is 100,000 units of currency, and now, there are also&nbsp;<strong>mini,</strong>&nbsp;<strong>micro</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>nano</strong>&nbsp;lot sizes that are 10,000, 1,000, and 100 units.</p>

    <p>Some brokers show quantity in &ldquo;lots&rdquo;, while other brokers show the actual currency units.</p>
    <p>As you may already know, the change in a currency value relative to another is measured in &ldquo;<strong>pips</strong>,&rdquo; which is a very, very small percentage of a unit of currency&rsquo;s value.</p>
    <p>To take advantage of this minute change in value, you need to trade large amounts of a particular currency in order to see any significant profit or loss.</p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s assume we will be using a 100,000 unit (standard) lot size. We will now recalculate some examples to see how it affects the pip value.</p>
    <ol>
    <li><strong>USD/JPY at an exchange rate of 119.80:</strong>&nbsp;(.01 / 119.80) x 100,000 = $8.34 per pip</li>
    <li><strong>USD/CHF at an exchange rate of 1.4555:</strong>&nbsp;(.0001 / 1.4555) x 100,000 = $6.87 per pip</li>
    </ol>
    <p>In cases where the U.S. dollar is not quoted first, the formula is slightly different.</p>
    <ol>
    <li><strong>EUR/USD at an exchange rate of 1.1930:</strong>&nbsp;(.0001 / 1.1930) X 100,000 = 8.38 x 1.1930 = $9.99734 rounded up will be $10 per pip</li>
    <li><strong>GBP/USD at an exchange rate of 1.8040:</strong>&nbsp;(.0001 / 1.8040) x 100,000 = 5.54 x 1.8040 = 9.99416 rounded up will be $10 per pip.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><br />Here are examples of pip values for EUR/USD and USD/JPY, depending on lot size.</p>

    <p>Your broker may have a different convention for calculating pip values relative to lot size but whatever way they do it, they&rsquo;ll be able to tell you what the pip value is for the currency you are trading at that particular time.</p>
    <p>In other words, they do all the math calculations for you!</p>
    <p>As the market moves, so will the pip value depending on what currency you are currently trading.</p>

    <h2>What the heck is leverage?</h2>
    <p>You are probably wondering how a small investor like yourself can trade such large amounts of money.</p>
    <p>Think of your broker as a bank who basically fronts you $100,000 to buy currencies.</p>
    <p>All the bank asks from you is that you give it $1,000 as a&nbsp;<strong>good faith deposit</strong>, which it will hold for you but not necessarily keep.</p>
    <p>Sounds too good to be true? This is how forex trading&nbsp;using leverage works.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/pre-school-Leverage.png" /></p>
    <p>The amount of leverage you use will depend on your broker and what you feel comfortable with.</p>
    <p>Typically the broker will require a deposit, also known as &ldquo;<strong>margin</strong>&ldquo;.</p>
    <p>Once you have deposited your money, you will then be able to trade. The broker will also specify how much margin is required per position (lot) traded.</p>
    <p>For example, if the allowed leverage is 100:1 (or 1% of position required), and you wanted to trade a position worth $100,000, but you only have $5,000 in your account.</p>
    <p>No problem as your broker would set aside $1,000 as a deposit and let you &ldquo;borrow&rdquo; the rest.</p>
    <p>Of course, any losses or gains will be deducted or added to the remaining cash balance in your account.</p>
    <p>The minimum security (margin) for each lot will vary from broker to broker.</p>
    <p>In the example above, the broker required a&nbsp;<strong>1% margin</strong>. This means that for every $100,000 traded, the broker wants $1,000 as a deposit on the position.</p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s say you want to buy 1 standard lot (100,000) of USD/JPY. If your account is allowed 100:1 leverage, you will have to put up $1,000 as margin.</p>
    <p>The $1,000 is NOT a fee, it&rsquo;s a&nbsp;<strong>deposit</strong>.</p>
    <p>You get it back when you close your trade.</p>
    <p>The reason the broker requires the deposit is that while the trade is open, there&rsquo;s the risk that you could lose money on the position!</p>
    <p>Assuming that this USD/JPY trade is the only position you have open in your account, you would have to maintain your account&rsquo;s equity (absolute value of your trading account) of at least $1,000&nbsp;<em>at all times</em>&nbsp;in order to be allowed to keep the trade open.</p>
    <p>If USD/JPY plummets and your trading losses cause your account equity to fall below $1,000, the broker&rsquo;s system would automatically close out your trade to prevent further losses.</p>
    <p>This is a safety mechanism to prevent your account balance from going&nbsp;<em>negative</em>.</p>
    <p>Understanding how margin trading works is so important that we have dedicated a whole section&nbsp;to it later in the School.</p>
    <p>It is a must-read if you don&rsquo;t want to blow up your account!</p>
    <p>Moving on for now&hellip;</p>
    <h2>How the heck do I calculate profit and loss?</h2>
    <p>So now that you know how to calculate pip value and leverage, let&rsquo;s look at how you calculate your profit or loss.</p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s buy U.S. dollars and sell Swiss francs.</p>
    <ol>
    <li>The rate you are quoted is 1.4525 / 1.4530. Because you are buying U.S. dollars you will be working on the &ldquo;ASK&rdquo; price of 1.4530, the rate at which traders are prepared to sell.</li>
    <li>So you buy 1 standard lot (100,000 units) at 1.4530.</li>
    <li>A few hours later, the price moves to 1.4550 and you decide to close your trade.</li>
    <li>The new quote for USD/CHF is 1.4550 / 1.4555. Since you initially&nbsp;<strong>bought</strong>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<em>open</em>&nbsp;the trade, to&nbsp;<em>close</em>&nbsp;the trade, you now must&nbsp;<strong>sell</strong>&nbsp;in order to close the trade so you must take the &ldquo;BID&rdquo; price of 1.4550. The price that traders are prepared to buy at.</li>
    <li>The difference between 1.4530 and 1.4550 is .0020 or 20 pips.</li>
    <li>Using our formula from before, we now have (.0001/1.4550) x 100,000 = $6.87 per pip x 20 pips = $137.40</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Bid/Ask Spread</h3>
    <p>Remember, when you enter or exit a trade, you are subject to the spread in the bid/ask quote.</p>
    <p>When&nbsp;<strong>you buy a currency, you will use the offer or ASK price.&nbsp;</strong></p>
    <p>When&nbsp;<strong>you sell, you will use the BID price</strong>.</p>
