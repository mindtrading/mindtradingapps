    <p>What&rsquo;s a pip?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve probably heard of the terms &ldquo;<strong>pips</strong>,&rdquo; &ldquo;<strong>points</strong>&ldquo;, &ldquo;<strong>pipettes</strong>,&rdquo; and &ldquo;<strong>lots</strong>&rdquo; thrown around, and now we&rsquo;re going to explain what they are and show you how their values are calculated.</p>
<p>Here is where we&rsquo;re going to do a little math. Just a little bit.</p>

<p>Take your time with this information, as it is required knowledge for all forex traders.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t even think about trading until you are comfortable with pip values and calculating profit and loss.</p>
<h2>What the heck is a Pip?</h2>
<p>The unit of measurement to express the change in value between two currencies is called a &ldquo;<strong>pip</strong>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If EUR/USD moves from 1.1050 to 1.1051, that .0001 USD rise in value is&nbsp;<strong>ONE PIP</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>A pip is usually the last decimal place of a price quote.</strong></p>
<p>Most pairs go out to 4 decimal places, but there are some exceptions like Japanese yen pairs (they go out to two decimal places).</p>
<p>For example, for EUR/USD, it is&nbsp;<strong>0.0001</strong>, and for USD/JPY, it is&nbsp;<strong>0.01</strong>.</p>

<h2>What is a Pipette?</h2>
<p>There are forex brokers that quote currency pairs beyond the standard &ldquo;4 and 2&rdquo; decimal places to &ldquo;5 and 3&rdquo; decimal places.</p>
<p>They are quoting&nbsp;<strong>FRACTIONAL PIPS</strong>, also called &ldquo;points&rdquo; or &ldquo;pipettes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If the concept of a &ldquo;pip&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t already confusing enough for the new forex trader, let&rsquo;s try to make you even more confused and point out that a &ldquo;point&rdquo; or &ldquo;pipette&rdquo; or &ldquo;fractional pip&rdquo; is equal to a &ldquo;<strong>tenth of a pip</strong>&ldquo;.</p>
<p>For instance, if GBP/USD moves from 1.3054<strong>2</strong>&nbsp;to 1.30543<strong>,</strong>&nbsp;that .00001 USD move higher is&nbsp;<strong>ONE PIPETTE.</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2011/03/20052450/pipette-780x293.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how fractional pips look like on a trading platform:</p>
<p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2011/03/12230739/fractional-pip.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>On trading platforms, the digit representing a tenth of a pip usually appears to the&nbsp;<em>right</em>&nbsp;of the two larger digits.<img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2011/03/15144610/pip-cheat-sheet-forex.png" alt="" /></p>
<h2>How to Calculate the Value of a Pip</h2>
<p>As each currency has its own relative value, it&rsquo;s necessary to calculate the value of a pip for that particular currency pair.</p>
<p>In the following example, we will use a quote with 4 decimal places.</p>
<p>For the purpose of better explaining the calculations, exchange rates will be expressed as a ratio (i.e., EUR/USD at 1.2500 will be written as &ldquo;1 EUR / 1.2500 USD&rdquo;)</p>
<h3>Example #1: USD/CAD = 1.0200</h3>
<p>To be read as 1 USD to 1.0200 CAD (or 1 USD/1.0200 CAD)</p>
<p>(The value change in counter currency) times the exchange rate ratio = pip value (in terms of the base currency)</p>
<p><strong>[.0001 CAD] x [1 USD/1.0200 CAD]</strong></p>
<p>Or simply as:</p>
<p>[(.0001&nbsp;CAD) / (1.0200&nbsp;CAD)] x 1 USD = 0.00009804 USD per unit traded</p>
<p>Using this example, if we traded 10,000 units of USD/CAD, then a one pip change to the exchange rate would be approximately a 0.98 USD change in the position value (10,000 units x 0.00009804 USD/unit).</p>
<p>We say &ldquo;approximately&rdquo; because as the exchange rate changes, so does the value of each pip move.</p>
<h3>Example #2: GBP/JPY =&nbsp;123.00</h3>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another example using a currency pair with the Japanese Yen as the counter currency.</p>
<p>Notice that this currency pair only goes to two decimal places to measure a 1 pip change in value (most of the other currencies have four decimal places). In this case, a one pip move would be .01 JPY.</p>
<p>(The value change in counter currency) times the exchange rate ratio = pip value (in terms of the base currency)</p>
<p><strong>[.01 JPY] x [1 GBP/123.00 JPY]</strong></p>
<p>Or simply as:</p>
<p>[(.01&nbsp;JPY) / (123.00&nbsp;JPY)] x 1 GBP = 0.0000813 GBP</p>
<p>So, when trading 10,000 units of GBP/JPY, each pip change in value is worth approximately 0.813 GBP.</p>
<h2>How to Find the Pip Value in Your Trading Account&rsquo;s Currency</h2>
<p>The final question to ask when figuring out the pip value of your position is, &ldquo;What is the pip value in terms of my trading account&rsquo;s currency?&rdquo;</p>
<p>After all, it is a global market and&nbsp;<strong>not everyone has their account denominated in the same currency</strong>.</p>
<p>This means that the pip value will have to be translated to whatever currency our account may be traded in.</p>
<p>This calculation is probably the easiest of all; simply multiply/divide the &ldquo;<strong>found pip value</strong>&rdquo; by the exchange rate of your account currency and the currency in question.</p>
<p>If the &ldquo;found pip value&rdquo; currency is the same currency as the base currency in the exchange rate quote:</p>
<p>Using the GBP/JPY example above, let&rsquo;s convert the found pip value of .813 GBP to the pip value in USD by using GBP/USD at 1.5590 as our exchange rate ratio.</p>
<p>If the currency you are converting to is the counter currency of the exchange rate, all you have to do is divide the &ldquo;found pip value&rdquo; by the corresponding exchange rate ratio:</p>
<p><strong><strong>.813 GBP per pip / (1 GBP/1.5590 USD)</strong></strong></p>
<p>Or</p>
<p>[(.813&nbsp;GBP) / (1&nbsp;GBP)] x (1.5590 USD) = 1.2674 USD per pip move</p>
<p>So, for every .01 pip move in GBP/JPY, the value of a 10,000 unit position changes by approximately 1.27 USD.</p>
<p>If the currency you are converting to is the base currency of the conversion exchange rate ratio, then multiply the &ldquo;found pip value&rdquo; by the conversion exchange rate ratio.</p>
<p>Using our USD/CAD example above, we want to find the pip value of .98 USD in New Zealand Dollars. We&rsquo;ll use .7900 as our conversion exchange rate ratio:</p>
<p><strong><strong>0.98 USD per pip X (1 NZD/.7900 USD)</strong></strong></p>
<p>Or</p>
<p>[(0.98&nbsp;USD) / (.7900&nbsp;USD)] x (1 NZD) = 1.2405 NZD per pip move</p>
<p>For every .0001 pip move in USD/CAD from the example above, your 10,000 unit position changes in value by approximately 1.24 NZD.</p>
<p>Even though you&rsquo;re now a math genius&ndash;at least with pip values&ndash;you&rsquo;re probably rolling your eyes back and thinking, &ldquo;Do I really need to work all this out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, the answer is a big fat NO. Nearly all forex brokers will work all this out for you automatically, but it&rsquo;s always good for you to know how they work it out.</p>
<p>If your broker doesn&rsquo;t happen to do this, don&rsquo;t worry! You can use our Pip Value Calculator! Aren&rsquo;t we awesome?!</p>
<p>In the next lesson, we will discuss how these seemingly insignificant amounts can add up.</p>
