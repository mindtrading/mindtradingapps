    <p>Just when Asian market&nbsp;participants are starting to close shop, their European counterparts are just beginning their day.</p>
    <p>While there are several financial centers all around Europe, it is London that market participants keep their eyes on.</p>

    <p>Historically,&nbsp;<strong>London</strong>&nbsp;has always been at a center of trade, thanks to its strategic location.</p>
    <p>Today, London benefits from its time zone. London&rsquo;s morning overlaps with late trading in Asia and London&rsquo;s afternoon overlap with New York City.</p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s no wonder that it is considered the&nbsp;<strong>forex capital of the world</strong>&nbsp;with thousands of folks making transactions every single minute.</p>
    <p><strong>About 43% of all forex transactions happen in London.</strong></p>
    <p>Some traders also refer to the London session as the &ldquo;<strong>European</strong>&rdquo; trading session.</p>
    <p>That&rsquo;s because aside from London, there are major financial centers open in Europe as well, such as&nbsp;Geneva, Frankfurt, Zurich, Luxembourg, Paris, Hamburg,&nbsp;Edinburgh, and Amsterdam.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>We built a Forex Market Hours tool that will&nbsp;<strong>automatically convert all four trading sessions in your local time zone</strong>. Use it as a reference until you remember the market hours from memory.&nbsp;ðŸ§ </p>

    <p>These pip values were calculated using averages of past data. Take note that these are&nbsp;<strong>NOT ABSOLUTE VALUES</strong>&nbsp;and can vary depending on liquidity and other market conditions.</p>
    <p>Also, the session range for EUR/CHF has not been included since the Swiss franc has been pegged to the euro at 1.2000 during the period.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Here are some neat facts about the European session:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Because the London session crosses with the two other major trading sessions&ndash;and with London being such a key financial center&ndash;a large chunk of forex transactions take place during this time. This leads to high liquidity and potentially lower transaction costs, i.e., lower pip spreads.</li>
    <li>Due to the large number of transactions that take place, the London trading session is normally the most volatile session.</li>
    <li>Most trends begin during the London session, and they typically will continue until the beginning of the New York session.</li>
    <li>Volatility tends to die down in the middle of the session, as traders often go off to eat lunch before waiting for the New York trading period to begin.</li>
    <li>Trends can sometimes reverse at the end of the London session, as European traders may decide to lock in profits.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Which Pairs Should You Trade?</h2>
    <p>Because of the volume of transactions that take place, there is so much liquidity during the European session that almost any pair can be traded.</p>
    <p>Of course, it may be best to stick with the majors (EUR/USD, GBP/USD, USD/JPY, and USD/CHF), as these normally have the tightest spreads.</p>
    <p>Also, it is these pairs that are normally directly influenced by any news reports that come out during the European session.</p>
    <p>You can also try the yen crosses (more specifically, EUR/JPY and GBP/JPY), as these tend to be pretty volatile at this time.</p>
    <p>Because these are cross pairs, the spreads might be a little wider though.</p>
    <p>Next up, we have the New York session, a jungle where dreams are made of. Hey, isn&rsquo;t that an Alicia Keys song?</p>
