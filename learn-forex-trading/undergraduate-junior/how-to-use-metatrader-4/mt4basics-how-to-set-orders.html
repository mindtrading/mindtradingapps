    <p>Now that you&rsquo;ve set up your MT4 account, it&rsquo;s time to learn how to use it!</p>
    <p>We know, we know. With so many tabs, windows, and buttons, the MT4 platform can look a little bit intimidating if it&rsquo;s your first time using it.</p>
    <p>But don&rsquo;t worry, it won&rsquo;t bite! Besides, we&rsquo;ll be holding your hand through the entire process and go nice and slow.</p>
    <p>We&rsquo;ll start with the basics &ndash; setting orders.</p>
    <p>By the time you&rsquo;re done with this lesson, you&rsquo;ll know how to:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Buy or sell via market execution</li>
    <li>Buy or sell via pending order</li>
    <li>Modify a trade after it has been entered</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Are you ready? Great! Let&rsquo;s begin!</p>
    <h3>Entering a Trade via Market Execution</h3>
    <p><br />Click the New Order button. You&rsquo;ll find it in the standard toolbar.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>A dialogue box should appear. From the drop-down list, select the currency pair you want to trade.</li>
    <li>Next, select Market Execution in the Order Type drop-down list.</li>
    <li>Enter the size of the position you want to open. Keep in mind that volume, which indicates the size of your position, is expressed in terms of standard lot sizes.&nbsp;Remember, one standard lot is worth 100,000 units. Hence, if you wish to buy 5,000 units of a certain currency pair, you would enter &ldquo;0.05&rdquo; in the volume field.</li>
    <li>If you have any remarks or notes you would like to include about your trade, you can do so in the comment field. This is optional.</li>
    <li>Finally, determine whether to BUY or SELL the currency pair. A dialogue box will appear to confirm that your trade has been executed.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You may have noticed that when you choose to buy or sell a pair at market, the stop loss&nbsp;and take profit fields may be disabled. Don&rsquo;t worry!</p>
    <p>These options have only been disabled to help you get in on a trade as fast as possible when price is already moving.</p>
    <p>You can still specify your exit levels by modifying the trade AFTER it has been entered. We&rsquo;ll teach you all about editing existing orders later on.</p>
    <h3>Entering a Trade via Pending Order</h3>
    <p><br />1. Click the&nbsp;<strong>New Order</strong>&nbsp;button.</p>
    <p>2. From the drop-down list, select the&nbsp;<strong>currency pair</strong>&nbsp;you want to trade.</p>
    <p>3. Next, select&nbsp;<strong>Pending Order</strong>&nbsp;in the Order Type dropdown list.</p>
    <p>4. Determine whether you want to&nbsp;<strong>BUY or SELL</strong>&nbsp;the pair in the Order Type dropdown list.</p>
    <p>You will be presented with 4 options:</p>
    <p><strong>Buy Limit</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; if you plan on going long at a level lower than market price</p>
    <p><strong>Sell Limit</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; if you plan on going short at a level higher than market price</p>
    <p><strong>Buy Stop</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; if you plan on going long at a level higher than market price</p>
    <p><strong>Sell Stop</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; if you plan on going short at a level lower than market price</p>
    <p>5. After you have selected the type of order, punch in the&nbsp;<strong>price</strong>&nbsp;at which you wish to enter the market.</p>
    <p>6. Then, enter the s<strong>ize of the position</strong>&nbsp;you want to open in the volume field.</p>
    <p>7. Fill in the&nbsp;<strong>stop loss and take profit</strong>&nbsp;fields.</p>
    <p>8. You&rsquo;ll notice that by using a Pending Order, you also have the option to&nbsp;<strong>set an expiry date</strong>&nbsp;on your order.</p>
    <p>9. Once you&rsquo;ve filled everything out, click the&nbsp;<strong>Place button</strong>&nbsp;to enter your trade. A dialogue box will appear to confirm that your trade has been executed.</p>
    <h3>Modifying Trades</h3>
    <p><br />Click on the&nbsp;<strong>Trade</strong>&nbsp;tab. There, you will find all of your trades, including their entry prices, position sizes, stop losses, and profit targets. If you don&rsquo;t see the&nbsp;<strong>Trade</strong>&nbsp;tab, don&rsquo;t worry, it&rsquo;s there. It&rsquo;s just hiding. Go up to the menu bar at the top of the window and click on&nbsp;<strong>View | Terminal</strong>&nbsp;(or click CTRL + T on your keyboard).</p>
    <p>To add/modify stop loss or profit target:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Right-click on the trade that you want to modify and select the &ldquo;Modify or Delete Order&rdquo; option.</li>
    <li>Next, fill in the Stop Loss and Take Profit fields with your desired levels. When you&rsquo;re done, hit the Modify button.</li>
    <li>A dialogue box should appear to confirm that your trade adjustments have been executed.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To close an open trade:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Right-click the trade you wish to close and click the &ldquo;Close Order&rdquo; option.</li>
    <li>If you want to close your entire position, select the yellow button below the Buy and Sell options.</li>
    <li>After hitting close, your profit balance should change and reflect the profit or loss you made on your recently closed trade.</li>
    </ul>
