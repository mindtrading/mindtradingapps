    <p>Congratulations! If you&rsquo;ve made your way to this lesson, it means that you&rsquo;re now ready to open a demo or live&nbsp;<strong>MetaTrader 4</strong>&nbsp;(MT4) trading account.</p>
    <p>And because BabyPips.com is the bee&rsquo;s knees, we&rsquo;re here to guide you through it.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2010/08/05113840/metatrader-4-forex.png" /></p>
    <p>First, you should know that&nbsp;<strong>MetaTrader 4</strong>&nbsp;(MT4) is simply a trading platform used by tons of traders and brokers.</p>
    <p>Traders use it to view real-time currency prices, open or adjust orders, get technical and fundamental analysis. Meanwhile, brokers use the MT4 platform to reach a broader audience.</p>
    <p>What&rsquo;s good about the MT4 platform is that it offers boatloads of currency pairs and indicators that you can choose from.</p>
    <p>Not only that, but its customizable charts are so newbie-friendly that any six-year-old kid can spot breakout patterns from it.</p>

    <p>Mechanical traders can also plug in their EAs in the MT4 platform. This makes it easy for them to track trade opportunities.</p>
    <p>The MT4 platform can&rsquo;t be accessed through a website though. You have to install the platform on your computer or your phone before you can gain access to your trades and currency prices.</p>
    <p>Want to open your account now? Here&rsquo;s how:</p>
    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions:</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Set up your MT4 account</h3>
    <p>a) Download and install MT4.exe</p>
    <p>b) Carefully fill in the account details.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Record your account details</h3>
    <p>a) Record and keep a copy of your account login information before exiting the registration process.</p>
    <p>b) With MT4, you are able to create and access multiple accounts without exiting the program. Please pay attention to which account you are using before placing trades and orders.</p>

    <p>As much as we&rsquo;d like you to go forth and make live pips, we HIGHLY ENCOURAGE you to try&nbsp;<strong>demo trading</strong>&nbsp;first.</p>
    <p>This way you&rsquo;ll get the feel of the platform without putting any of your hard-earned capital at risk.</p>
    <p>Besides, unlike in live trading, you can always add to your capital or open a new one if you blow out your account or if your demo account expires.</p>
