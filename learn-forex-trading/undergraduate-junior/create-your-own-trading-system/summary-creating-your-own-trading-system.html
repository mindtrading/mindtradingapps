    <p>There are many systems out there that work, but many forex traders lack the discipline to follow the rules and as a result, still end up losing money.</p>
    <h2>Your mechanical trading system should attempt to accomplish two goals:</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Be able to identify a trend as early as possible.</li>
    <li>Be able to find ways to avoid whipsaws (confirm your trend).</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If it is profitable, then you trade your forex system live on a demo account for at least 2 months.</p>
    <p>This will help you get an idea of how you would trade your system when the market is moving. It is a lot different trading live than manually backtesting.</p>
    <p>Once you&rsquo;ve demo traded your system for at least 2 months and you are still profitable, you are then ready to trade your system live with real money.</p>
    <p>However, you must always remember to stick to your rules no matter what!</p>
    <h2>There are 6 steps to developing your mechanical forex trading system:</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Find your time frame.</li>
    <li>Find indicators to help you identify trends early.</li>
    <li>Find indicators to help you avoid whipsaws and confirm your trend.</li>
    <li>Define your risk.</li>
    <li>Define your entry and exit.</li>
    <li>Write your forex trading system rules down and ALWAYS stick to those rules!</li>
    </ol>
    <h2><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/junior-forex-trading-system-summary.png" /></h2>
    <h2>There are 3 phases to testing your system:</h2>
    <p><strong>First Phase:</strong>&nbsp;Go back and time and move your chart forward one candle at a time.</p>
    <p>Trade your system according to its rules and record your trades to see if it ends up being profitable. This is called backtesting.</p>
    <p><strong>Second Phase:</strong>&nbsp;If it is profitable, then you trade your system live on a demo account for at least 2 months.</p>
    <p>This will help you get an idea of how you would trade your system when the market is moving. It is a lot different trading live than manually backtesting.</p>
    <p><strong>Third Phase:</strong>&nbsp;Once you&rsquo;ve demo traded your system for at least 2 months and you are still profitable, you are then ready to trade your system live with real money.</p>
    <p>However, you must always remember to stick to your rules no matter what!</p>
    <p>Okay now legal stuff our lawyers asked us to add:</p>
    <p><strong>HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS HAVE MANY INHERENT LIMITATIONS, SOME OF WHICH ARE DESCRIBED BELOW. NO REPRESENTATION IS BEING MADE THAT ANY ACCOUNT WILL OR IS LIKELY TO ACHIEVE PROFITS OR LOSSES SIMILAR TO THOSE SHOWN. IN FACT, THERE ARE FREQUENTLY SHARP DIFFERENCES BETWEEN HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS AND THE ACTUAL RESULTS SUBSEQUENTLY ACHIEVED BY ANY PARTICULAR TRADING PROGRAM. ONE OF THE LIMITATIONS OF HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS IS THAT THEY ARE GENERALLY PREPARED WITH THE BENEFIT OF HINDSIGHT. IN ADDITION, HYPOTHETICAL TRADING DOES NOT INVOLVE FINANCIAL RISK, AND NO HYPOTHETICAL TRADING RECORD CAN COMPLETELY ACCOUNT FOR THE IMPACT OF FINANCIAL RISK IN ACTUAL TRADING. FOR EXAMPLE, THE ABILITY TO WITHSTAND LOSSES OR ADHERE TO A PARTICULAR FOREX TRADING PROGRAM IN SPITE OF TRADING LOSSES ARE MATERIAL POINTS WHICH CAN ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT ACTUAL TRADING RESULTS. THERE ARE NUMEROUS OTHER FACTORS RELATED TO THE MARKETS IN GENERAL OR TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ANY SPECIFIC TRADING PROGRAM WHICH CANNOT BE FULLY ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE PREPARATION OF HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS AND ALL OF WHICH CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT ACTUAL TRADING RESULTS.</strong></p><!DOCTYPE html>

        <p>You need to keep a&nbsp;<strong>trading journal</strong>.</p>
        <p>Journaling?!?</p>
        <p>Isn&rsquo;t that only for silly high school girls who write about their silly crushes on silly high school boys?</p>
        <p>Heck ya!</p>
        <p>Ok, not really&hellip; high school girls keep DIARIES.</p>
        <p>Boys also (we don&rsquo;t discriminate).</p>
        <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/junior-trading-journal.png" />Forex traders keep trading&nbsp;<strong>JOURNALS</strong>.</p>
        <p>Two entirely different things! Get it right! Geez!</p>
        <p>Keeping a trading journal is actually a crucial task in any performance or goal-oriented endeavor. The key is to have some way to measure, track, and stay focused on improving your performance.</p>
        <p>World-class athletes do it to keep track of what helps them to be better, faster, and stronger on the field or court.</p>
        <p>Scientists do it in the process of finding their next greatest discovery. And forex traders do it to help get them duckets!</p>
        <p>What &ldquo;getting them duckets&rdquo; means in simple terms is to become disciplined, consistent, and most importantly, profitable.</p>
        <p><strong>A disciplined trader is a profitable trader and keeping a trading journal is the first step to building your discipline.</strong></p>
        <p>This might sound simple or easy but we assure you that to actually get started can be very difficult.</p>
        <p>In fact, many forex traders give up after a while and rely on the logs that the forex broker provides.</p>
        <p>The logs or transaction history from your forex broker gives information that is, at best, marginally useful as it doesn&rsquo;t tell you much of&nbsp;<strong>WHY</strong>&nbsp;you entered and exited the trade.</p>
        <p>That information provides&nbsp;<strong>NO</strong>&nbsp;help to your next trade.</p>
        <p>Zero. Zilch. Nein. Nada.</p>
        <p>A trading journal isn&rsquo;t just about writing in the prices of your entry and exit and the time you executed the trade.</p>
        <p>The trading journal is also about refining your methods and mastering your own psychology.</p>
        <p>To be even more specific, it is about your&nbsp;<strong>individual emotional psychology before, during, and after the trade.</strong></p>
        <p>For example, your trading method says to buy USD/JPY.</p>
        <p><strong>But</strong>&nbsp;your gut feeling tells you that the trade is&nbsp;<strong>NOT</strong>&nbsp;going to work&hellip;</p>
        <p>So you remind yourself, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think this trade is going to work. BUT I have to follow my trading plan so I&rsquo;ll take it.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>During the middle of your trade, the price comes 3 pips away from your stop loss and you&rsquo;re thinking, &ldquo;<strong>OMG. This trade isn&rsquo;t looking so good. I knew it! Why didn&rsquo;t I listen to myself? I&rsquo;m such an idiot! I&rsquo;m about to lose here! I&rsquo;ll just exit now.</strong>&rdquo;</p>
        <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2010/09/my-trade-is-losing.png" /></p>
        <p>You then decide to close your trade.</p>
        <p>A few moments later the price shoots to your original profit target. Had you stayed in the trade you would have made a gazillion pips!</p>
        <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2010/09/trade-wouldve-won.png" /></p>
        <p>This is why you should write a trading journal. This is a classic case that probably happens to too many traders.</p>
        <p><strong>We fail to stay in the trade, we fail to trade the plan, and most importantly, we fail to distance our emotions from our trading!</strong></p>
        <p>If you keep trading like that and you don&rsquo;t keep a trading journal, the balance on your trading account will become a big fat&nbsp;ZERO&nbsp;before you realize what you&rsquo;re doing wrong.</p>
