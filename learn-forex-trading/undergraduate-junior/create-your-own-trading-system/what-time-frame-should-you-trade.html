    <p>What time frame should you trade your system on?</p>
    <p>The smaller the timeframe, the more difficult it is to develop a successful system.</p>
    <p>In other words, developing a system to trade on a 5-minute chart is more difficult than developing a system that trades on a daily chart.</p>
    <p><strong>There is a lot more noise on the smaller timeframes.&nbsp;</strong></p>
    <p>Given the massive amount of data you would need to test the system over the years and years of different data, it can be a challenging task.</p>
    <p><strong>Smaller timeframes often mean less profit per trade and less risk per trade.</strong></p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s a good idea to strike a balance between your trading account size and the risk you are willing to take.</p>
    <h2>The New Trader&rsquo;s Trap</h2>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2020/10/03164945/new-trader-trap.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at what&rsquo;s called the &ldquo;New Trader&rsquo;s Trap&rdquo;:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>The smaller your trading account, the smaller the time frame you should trade.</li>
    <li>The smaller the timeframe, the more difficult it is to trade.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Do you see the trap here?</p>
    <p>New traders often come into the trading world with very little cash, hoping to make a quick buck.</p>
    <p>So they trade small timeframes because they think intraday trading is the way to make money.</p>
    <p>They start trading on a 1-minute or 5-minute chart in hopes to scalp the market a few pips here and there.</p>
    <p>By doing so, they suddenly put themselves in a very difficult spot because they are trading a very difficult timeframe when they are least experienced!</p>
    <p>They set themselves up for a quick fail.</p>
    <p><strong>It&rsquo;s much easier to develop profitable trading systems on a daily time frame than on a 5-minute chart</strong>.</p>
    <p>Because of this, we recommend that new system traders build trading systems on daily charts.</p>
    <p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter if you ever plan on trading those timeframes.&nbsp;You do it to build confidence and skills in developing profitable systems.</p>
    <p>Because you are more likely to develop a profitable system on a daily chart than a 5-minute chart, you should start on the daily chart.</p>
    <p>Why bang your head against a wall and discourage yourself? Build your confidence and skill level then move on to more difficult intraday timeframes.</p>
    <h2><strong>Should you scalp?</strong></h2>
    <p>Scalping is something that intrigues many system traders. The challenge of taking small, consistent trades from the market daily while risking very little is appealing.</p>
    <p>With scalping, it&rsquo;s generally expected you are trading from a small time frame, probably 5-minutes or less.</p>
    <p>The idea is to open a position and capture only a few pips of profit.</p>
    <p>The appeal is since we are trading from such a small timeframe, your risk is small, which means you can trade with a small account.</p>
    <p>Often you will have setups that produce high win rates and occur more frequently than setups on a higher timeframe such as hourly or daily.</p>
    <p>There tends to be a higher frequency of trading opportunities with scalping which can potentially lead to large accumulated profits versus your starting account balance.</p>
    <p>Scalping for the retail trader is very difficult to do.</p>
    <p>Almost all retail traders who try scalping will fail.</p>
    <p>If you&rsquo;re new to trading, we wouldn&rsquo;t recommend it. Why?</p>
    <p>When trading in these timeframes, you are competing with&nbsp;<strong>high-frequency trading</strong> (HFT) firms running automated trading programs (algos) built by a team of Ph.D. brainiacs.</p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s like a basketball newbie trying to play LeBron James.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2020/10/03165336/hft-eats-retail-trader.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>Other significant barriers are the&nbsp;<strong>transaction cost</strong>&nbsp;in both the&nbsp;<strong>spread</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>slippage</strong>.</p>
    <p>The difference between what a buyer will pay and what the seller will receive at a given point in time is referred to as the bid-ask spread.</p>
    <p>Your broker buys from you at a lower &ldquo;bid&rdquo; price, while selling to you a higher&nbsp;&ldquo;ask&rdquo; price.</p>
    <p>The bid and ask prices are your broker&rsquo;s quoted prices or &ldquo;quotes&rdquo;.</p>
    <p>The bid-ask spread is used as a proxy for transaction costs.</p>
    <p>The quoted spread measures the cost of completing a &ldquo;round trip&rdquo; (buy and sell)order if trades are executed at the quoted prices.</p>
    <p>Transaction costs for a single trade are often measured as&nbsp;<strong>half the spread</strong>.</p>
    <p>If you&rsquo;re paying a 2-pip spread to enter and exit a trade and make a 4-pip gain, half (50%) of your profits are going to paying the spreads!</p>
    <p>Scalping means smaller profit per trade yet, as you drill down to smaller and smaller time frames,&nbsp;<strong>your costs remain fixed</strong>.</p>
    <p>If you traded on a slower time frame like a daily chart and made a 400-pip gain, you&rsquo;d pay 0.5% of profits to pay the spreads versus 50% in the previous example. That&rsquo;s a big difference!</p>
    <p>As the negative impact of transaction costs and slippages grows, this takes a more significant percentage of your profits.</p>
    <p>A single pip of slippage is hardly noticed when you are holding a trade for several days with an average profit of $100 per trade.</p>
    <p>However, on a scalping system, a&nbsp;<strong>single pip is the difference between life and death</strong>.</p>
    <p>Then throw in latency, computer issues, internet issues and your margin for error is tiny.</p>
    <p>Again, on larger timeframes, you can exit a trade now or in a few seconds, and it won&rsquo;t matter that much.</p>
    <p>Not so in the scalping world where everything is hypersensitive, and&nbsp;<strong>your margin for error is tiny</strong>.</p>
    <p>In closing, if you&rsquo;re new to building trading systems or don&rsquo;t already have strategies trading live on the market that&rsquo;s making money, focus on building systems on higher timeframes first.</p>
