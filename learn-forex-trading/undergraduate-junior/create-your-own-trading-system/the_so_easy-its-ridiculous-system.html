    <p>As you can see, we have all the components of a good forex trading system.</p>
    <p>First, we&rsquo;ve decided that this is a swing trading&nbsp;system and that we will trade on a&nbsp;<strong>daily chart</strong>.</p>
    <p>Next, we use simple moving averages to help us&nbsp;<strong>identify a new trend</strong>&nbsp;as early as possible.</p>
    <p>The Stochastic helps us determine if it&rsquo;s still ok for us to enter a trade after a&nbsp;<strong>moving average crossover</strong>, and it also helps us&nbsp;<strong>avoid oversold and overbought areas</strong>.</p>
    <p><strong>The RSI is an extra confirmation tool</strong>&nbsp;that helps us determine the strength of our trend.</p>
    <p>After figuring out our trade setup, we then determined our&nbsp;<strong>risk</strong>&nbsp;for each trade.</p>
    <p>For this system, we are willing to&nbsp;<strong>risk 100 pips on each trade</strong>.</p>
    <p>Usually, the higher the time frame, the more pips you should be willing to risk because your gains will typically be larger than if you were to trade on a smaller time frame.</p>
    <p>Next, we&nbsp;<strong>clearly define our entry and exit rules.</strong></p>
    <p>At this point, we would begin the&nbsp;<strong>testing</strong>&nbsp;phase by starting with manual backtests.</p>
    <h2>Trade Example: Buy EUR/USD</h2>
    <p>Here&rsquo;s an example of a long trade setup:</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/junior-so-easy-its-ridiculous-system-long-entry-tn.png" /></p>
    <p>If we went back in time and looked at this chart, we would see that according to our system rules, this would be a good time to go long.</p>
    <p>To backtest, you would write down at what price you would&rsquo;ve entered, your stop loss, and your exit strategy.</p>
    <p>Then you would move the chart one candle at a time to see how the trade unfolds.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/junior-so-easy-its-ridiculous-system-long-entry-end-tn.png" /></p>
    <p>In this particular case, you would&rsquo;ve made some decent pips! You could&rsquo;ve bought yourself something nice after this trade!</p>
    <p>You can see that when the moving averages cross in the opposite direction, it was a good time for us to exit.</p>
    <p>Of course, not all your trades will look this sexy. Some will look like ugly heifers, but you should always remember to stay disciplined and stick to your trading system rules.</p>
    <h2>Trade Example: Sell EUR/USD</h2>
    <p>Here&rsquo;s an example of a short entry order for the &ldquo;So Easy It&rsquo;s Ridiculous&rdquo; system.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/junior-so-easy-its-ridiculous-system-short-entry-tn.png" /></p>
    <p>We can see that our criteria are met, as there was a moving average crossover, the Stochastic was showing downward momentum and not yet in oversold territory, and RSI&nbsp;was less than 50.</p>
    <p>At this point,&nbsp;we would&nbsp;<strong>enter short.</strong></p>
    <p>Now we would record our entry price, our stop loss, and exit strategy, and then move the chart forward one candle at a time to see what happens.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/junior-so-easy-its-ridiculous-system-short-entry-end-tn.png" /></p>
    <p>Boo yeah baby! As it turns out, the trend was pretty strong and the pair dropped almost&nbsp;<strong>800 pips</strong>&nbsp;before another crossover was made!</p>
    <p>Now isn&rsquo;t that ridiculously easy?</p>

    <p>We know you&rsquo;re probably thinking that this system is too simple to be profitable. Well, the truth is that it is simple. You shouldn&rsquo;t be scared of something that&rsquo;s simple.</p>
    <p>In fact, there is an acronym that you will often see in the trading world called KISS.</p>
    <p>It stands for&nbsp;<strong>Keep It Simple Stupid</strong>!</p>
    <p>It basically means that forex trading systems don&rsquo;t have to be complicated.</p>
    <p>You don&rsquo;t have to have a zillion indicators on your chart. In fact, keeping it simple will give you less of a headache.</p>
    <p>The most important thing is&nbsp;<strong>discipline</strong>. We can&rsquo;t stress it enough. Well, yes we can.</p>
    <p><strong>YOU MUST ALWAYS STICK TO YOUR TRADING SYSTEM RULES!</strong></p>
    <p>If you have tested your forex system thoroughly through backtesting and by trading it live on a DEMO account for at least a month (or two).</p>
    <p>Then you should feel confident enough to know that as long as you follow your rules, you will end up profitable in the long run.</p>
    <p><strong>Trust your system and trust yourself!</strong></p>
