    <p><strong>Each trader is unique.</strong></p>
    <p>There are over 8 billion people in the world (including space aliens disguised as humans and automobiles) and not one person is exactly the same as another.</p>
    <p>Even identical twins will have different fingerprints.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2010/09/17222657/twins-150x150.png" /></p>
    <p>Everyone has their own look, personality, talents, and pizza topping preferences (we like pepperoni and potato chips).</p>
    <p>We all like different things and are unique in our own way.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/junior-zoltran.png"  /></p>
    <p>Trading is the same way. Our unique personalities will lead us to trade differently from one another.</p>
    <p>Some may be aggressive, &ldquo;type A&rdquo; personality traders while others may be more relaxed, &ldquo;type B&rdquo; personality traders.</p>
    <p>Some may like taking small wins all the time, while others don&rsquo;t mind losing a bit in order to make those huge gains when they do win.</p>
    <p>As traders, there are a wide variety of approaches available to try to interpret price movements and try to profit from them.</p>
    <p>Some traders may use a particular approach almost exclusively.</p>
    <p><strong>The point is that no two traders are alike.</strong></p>
    <p>Even if a group of people was to trade the same system rules, each person&rsquo;s end results would most likely be different from everyone else.</p>
    <p>Is that a bad thing?</p>
    <p>Not at all!</p>
    <p><strong>Our uniqueness is what makes the world go round</strong>, so it&rsquo;s important to know your lifestyle and personality to help identify trading strengths and weaknesses.</p>

    <p>If your stomach has always been sensitive to spicy food since birth and you try to force yourself to eat pizza loaded with&nbsp;habanero and&nbsp;jalape&ntilde;o peppers to try to impress that hot gal or guy while on a date, this will probably result in you experiencing frustration (on the toilet seat) and may eventually hinder the toilet (from flushing).</p>

    <p>The same goes for trading.</p>
    <p>Trying to force a trade that doesn&rsquo;t match your personality will result in frustration and can hinder you from making consistent profits.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2010/09/17222511/frustrated-trader-360x360.png" /><br />The next lessons will take you through a variety of trading styles so that you can identify which one may match you the best.</p>
