    <p><strong>Swing trading</strong>&nbsp;refers to the medium-term trading style that is used by forex traders who try to profit from price swings.</p>
    <p>It is trading style requires patience to hold your trades for several days at a time. Swing trading stands between two other popular trading styles: day trading and position trading.</p>
    <p>Swing traders identify a possible&nbsp;trend&nbsp;and then hold the trade(s) for a period of time,&nbsp;<strong>from a minimum of two days to several weeks</strong>.</p>
    <p>It is ideal for those who can&rsquo;t monitor their charts throughout the day but can dedicate a couple of hours analyzing the market every night.</p>

    <p>Swing trading is best suited for those who have full-time jobs or school but have enough free time to stay up-to-date with what is going on in the global economy.</p>
    <p>Swing trading strategies employ&nbsp;fundamental&nbsp;or technical analysis&nbsp;in order to determine whether or not a particular currency pair might go up or down in price in the near future.</p>
    <p><strong>Swing trading attempts to identify &ldquo;swings&rdquo; within a medium-term trend and enter only when there seems to be a high probability of winning.</strong></p>
    <p>For example, in an uptrend, you aim to buy (go long) at &ldquo;<strong>swing lows.</strong>&rdquo; And conversely, sell (go short) at &ldquo;<strong>swing highs</strong>&rdquo; to take advantage of temporary countertrends.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2010/09/swing-trading-highs-lows.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>Because trades last much&nbsp;<strong>longer than one day, larger stop losses are required to weather volatility</strong>, and a forex trader must adapt that to their money management plan.</p>
    <p>You will most likely see trades go against you during the holding time since there can be many fluctuations in the price during the shorter time frames.</p>
    <p>It is important that you are able to remain calm during these times and trust in your analysis.</p>
    <p>Since trades usually have larger targets, spreads won&rsquo;t have as much of an impact on your overall profits.</p>
    <p>As a result, trading pairs with larger spreads and lower liquidity are acceptable.</p>

    <h2>Types of Swing Trading</h2>
    <p>How do you swing trade?</p>
    <p>There are several different trading strategies often used by swing traders.</p>
    <p>Here are the four most popular:&nbsp;<strong>reversal</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>retracement</strong>&nbsp;(or pullback),&nbsp;<strong>breakouts</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>breakdowns</strong>.</p>
    <h3>Reversal Trading</h3>
    <p>Reversal trading relies on a change in price momentum. A&nbsp;<strong>reversal</strong>&nbsp;is a change in the trend direction of an asset&rsquo;s price. For example, when an upward trend loses momentum and the price starts to move downwards. A reversal can be positive or negative (or bullish or bearish).</p>
    <h3>Retracement Trading</h3>
    <p>Retracement&nbsp;(or pullback) trading involves looking for a price to&nbsp;<em>temporarily</em>&nbsp;reverse within a larger trend. Price temporarily retraces to an earlier price point and then continues to move in the same direction later.</p>
    <p>Reversals are sometimes hard to predict and to tell apart from short-term pullbacks. While a reversal denotes a change in trend, a pullback is a shorter-term &ldquo;mini reversal&rdquo; within an existing trend.</p>
    <p>Think of a retracement (or pullback) as a &ldquo;minor countertrend within the major trend&rdquo;.</p>
    <p>If it&rsquo;s a retracement, price moving in against the primary trend should be&nbsp;<em>temporary</em>&nbsp;and relatively&nbsp;<em>brief</em>.</p>
    <p><strong>Reversals always start as potential pullbacks.</strong>&nbsp;The challenge is to know whether it is only a pullback or an actual trend reversal</p>
    <h3>Breakout Trading</h3>
    <p>Breakout trading is an approach where you take a position on the early side of an UPTREND, and looking for the price to&ldquo;<strong>breakout</strong>&rdquo;. You enter into a position as soon as price breaks a key level of RESISTANCE.</p>
    <h3>Breakdown Strategy</h3>
    <p>A breakdown strategy is the opposite of a breakout strategy. You take a position on the early side of a DOWNTREND and looking for price to&ldquo;<strong>breakdown</strong>&rdquo; (also known as a downside breakout). You enter into a position as soon as price breaks a key level of SUPPORT.</p>
    <h2>You might want to be a swing trader if:</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>You don&rsquo;t mind holding your trades for several days.</li>
    <li>You are willing to take fewer trades but more careful to make sure your trades are very good setups.</li>
    <li>You don&rsquo;t mind having large stop losses.</li>
    <li>You are patient.</li>
    <li>You are able to remain calm when trades move against you.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>You might NOT want to be a swing trader if:</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>You like fast-paced, action-packed trading.</li>
    <li>You are impatient and like to know whether you are right or wrong immediately.</li>
    <li>You get sweaty and anxious when trades go against you.</li>
    <li>You can&rsquo;t spend a couple of hours every day analyzing the markets.</li>
    <li>You can&rsquo;t give up your World of Warcraft raiding sessions.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you have a full-time job but enjoy trading on the side, then swing trading might be more your style!</p>
    <p>It is important to remember that every trading style has its pros and cons, and it is up to you the trader, which one you will choose.</p>
