    <p><strong>Scalping</strong>&nbsp;is like those high-action thriller movies that keep you on the edge of your seat. It&rsquo;s fast-paced, exciting, and mind-rattling all at once.</p>
    <p><strong>Scalp trading</strong>, also known as&nbsp;<strong>scalping</strong>, is a popular trading strategy characterized by relatively short time periods between the opening and closing of a trade.</p>
    <p>These types of trades are usually only held onto for a few seconds to a few minutes at the most!</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/junior-scalper.png"  />The main objective for forex scalpers is to&nbsp;<strong>grab very small amounts of pips as many times as they can throughout the busiest times of the day.</strong></p>
    <p>Its name is derived from the way its goals are achieved. A trader is literally trying to &ldquo;scalp&rdquo; lots of small profits from a huge number of trades throughout the day.</p>
    <p>What makes scalping so attractive to traders?</p>
    <p>Smaller moves happen more frequently than larger ones, even in relatively calm markets. This means that there are many small movements from which a scalper can benefit.</p>
    <p>Scalpers can place up to a&nbsp;<strong>few hundred trades in a single day</strong>, seeking small profits.</p>
    <p>All positions are closed at the end of the trading day.</p>
    <p>Because scalpers basically have to be&nbsp;<strong>glued to the charts</strong>, it is best suited for those who can spend several hours of undivided attention on their trading.</p>
    <p>It requires intense focus and quick thinking to be successful. Not everyone can handle such fast and demanding trading.</p>
    <p>Check out this post by our regular psychologist, Dr. Pipslow, on how to work on your concentration skills.</p>
    <p>It is not for those looking to make big wins all the time, but rather for those who like raking in small profits over the long run to make an overall profit.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/junior-scalping.png"  /></p>
    <p>The strategy behind scalping is that&nbsp;<strong>lots of small wins can easily morph into large gains</strong>.</p>
    <p>These small wins are achieved by trying to profit from quick changes in the bid-ask spread.</p>
    <p>Scalping focuses on&nbsp;<strong>larger position sizes</strong>&nbsp;for smaller profits in the shortest period of holding time: from a few seconds to minutes.</p>
    <p>The assumption is that price will complete the first stage of a movement in a short span of time so you aim to take advantage of market&nbsp;<strong>volatility</strong>.</p>
    <p>Market volatility is a scalper&rsquo;s best friend!</p>
    <p>With high market volatility, scalpers can open a long position, close it quickly, open a short position, close that, go long again&hellip;.you get the picture.</p>
    <p><strong>The main goal of scalping is to open a position at the ask or bid price and then quickly close the position a few points higher or lower for a profit.</strong></p>
    <p>A scalper wants to quickly &ldquo;<strong>cross the spread</strong>&ldquo;.</p>
    <p>For example, if you go long EUR/USD, with a bid-ask spread of 2 pips, your position instantly starts with an unrealized loss of 2 pips.</p>
    <p>Remember, when you buy, you buy at the ask price. But in order to exit, you need to sell, which is the bid price.</p>
    <p>A scalper wants that 2-pip loss to turn into a gain as fast as possible. In order to do this, the bid price needs to rise enough so it&rsquo;s higher than the ask price that the trade initially entered at.</p>
    <h2>You might be a forex scalper if:</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>You like fast trading and excitement</li>
    <li>You don&rsquo;t mind being focused on your charts for several hours at a time</li>
    <li>You are an impatient person who doesn&rsquo;t like to wait for long trades</li>
    <li>You can think fast and change bias, or direction, quickly</li>
    <li>You have fast fingers (put those esports skills to work!)</li>
    <li>You are a surgeon!</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>You might NOT be a forex scalper if:</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>You easily get stressed in fast-moving environments</li>
    <li>You can&rsquo;t commit several hours of undivided attention to your charts</li>
    <li>You&rsquo;d rather make fewer trades with higher profit gains</li>
    <li>You like taking your time to analyze the overall picture of the market</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Some things to consider if you decide to scalp:</h2>
    <h3>Trade only the most liquid pairs</h3>
    <p>Pairs such as the EUR/USD, GBP/USD, USD/CHF, and USD/JPY&nbsp;offer the tightest spreads because they tend to have the highest trading volume.</p>
    <p>You want your spreads to be as tight as possible since you will be entering the market frequently.</p>
    <h3>Trade only during the busiest times of the day</h3>
    <p>The most liquid times of the day are during the session overlaps. This is from 2:00 am to 4:00 am and from 8:00 am to 12:00 noon Eastern Time (EST).</p>
    <h3>Make sure to account for the spread</h3>
    <p>Because you enter the market frequently, spreads will be a big factor in your overall profit.</p>
    <p>As each trade carries transaction costs, scalping can result in more costs than profits.</p>
    <p>That&rsquo;s like working for an hour in a job that pays $5/hr and then going out and buying a $6 Starbucks&nbsp;Caramel Ribbon Crunch Frappuccino.</p>
    <p>Be sure your targets are at least<em>&nbsp;double your spread</em>&nbsp;so that you can account for the times the market moves against you.</p>
    <h3>Try focusing on one pair first</h3>
    <p>Scalping is very intense and if you can put all your energy into one pair, you&rsquo;ll have a better chance of being successful.</p>
    <p>Trying to scalp multiple pairs simultaneously as a noob will be almost suicidal.</p>
    <p>If you start to get accustomed to the pace of things, then you can start by adding on another pair and see how it works for you.</p>
    <h3>Make sure you follow good money management</h3>
    <p>This goes for any type of trading, but since you are making so many trades within a day you must be sticking to risk management practices.</p>
    <h3>Major news reports can throw you off</h3>
    <p>Because of slippage and high volatility, trading around highly anticipated news reports can be very dangerous.</p>
    <p>It sucks when you unexpectedly see the price jump in the opposite direction of your trade because of a news report!</p>
