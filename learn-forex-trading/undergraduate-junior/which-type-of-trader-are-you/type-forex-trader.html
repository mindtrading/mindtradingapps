    <p>In the previous lessons, we went through a variety of&nbsp;<strong>trading styles</strong>.</p>
    <p>Hopefully, you can identify which one may match you the best.</p>
    <p>If you already forgot what trading style is, fortunately, for you, it&rsquo;s time to review!</p>
    <p>There are four main types of trading styles:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>The Scalper</li>
    <li>The Day Trader</li>
    <li>The Swing Trader</li>
    <li>The Position Trader</li>
    </ol>
    <h2><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/junior-traders.png" /><br />1. Scalping</h2>
    <p><strong>Scalping</strong>&nbsp;is a fast-paced trading style where traders aim to profit from small price movements by executing numerous short-term trades throughout the day.</p>
    <p>Scalpers typically hold positions for a few seconds to a few minutes and rely on technical analysis to identify entry and exit points.</p>
    <p>Their main objective is to grab very small amounts of pips as many times as they can throughout the busiest times of the day.</p>
    <h2>2. Day Trading</h2>
    <p><strong>Day trading</strong>&nbsp;is a style where traders open and close positions within the same trading day.</p>
    <p>Day traders may use a mix of technical and fundamental analysis to capitalize on intraday price fluctuations.</p>
    <p>Day traders usually pick a side at the beginning of the day, acting on their bias, and then finishing the day with either a profit or a loss. These kinds of traders do not hold their trades overnight.</p>
    <h2>3. Swing Trading</h2>
    <p><strong>Swing trading</strong>&nbsp;is a style that involves holding positions for several days to a few weeks, seeking to profit from short to medium-term price trends.</p>
    <p>Swing traders may use a combination of technical and fundamental analysis to identify potential entry and exit points.</p>
    <p>These types of traders can&rsquo;t monitor their charts throughout the day so they dedicate a couple of hours to analyzing the market every night to make sound trading decisions.</p>
    <h2>4. Position Trading</h2>
    <p><strong>Position trading</strong>&nbsp;is a long-term approach where traders hold positions for weeks, months, or even years, aiming to capitalize on significant price trends.</p>
    <p>Position traders primarily rely on fundamental analysis to identify undervalued or overvalued assets, with technical analysis serving as a secondary tool.</p>
    <p>These traders know that fundamental themes will be the predominant factor when analyzing the markets and therefore make their trading decisions based on them.</p>
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>Identifying your trading style is a crucial step toward developing a personalized trading strategy that complements your strengths and preferences.</p>
    <p><strong>No matter what style you choose, you have to make sure that it truly fits your personality.</strong></p>
    <p>By understanding and embracing your preferred approach, you can create a sustainable and consistent plan that increases your chances of success in the markets.</p>
    <p>Always changing your trading style can lead to trouble and is a surefire way to blow your account.</p>
    <p>That said, if you try scalping and you realize after a week that it&rsquo;s too fast or too draining, then be flexible enough to switch it up.</p>
    <p><strong>There is no one-size-fits-all solution in trading</strong>, and the key to long-term success lies in self-awareness, continuous learning, and adaptation.</p>
