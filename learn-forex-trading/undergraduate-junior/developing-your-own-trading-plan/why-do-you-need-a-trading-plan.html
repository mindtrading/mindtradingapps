    <p>A trading plan will make trading simpler than it would be if you traded without one.</p>
    <p>Think of when you use a GPS device. (Or Google Maps on your smartphone.)</p>
    <p>You enter where you want to go. It then figures out where you currently are and then shows you how to get to where you want to go.</p>
    <p>You&rsquo;re able to constantly check on your GPS to see if you&rsquo;re still on the right track.</p>
    <p>When you make a wrong turn, it knows to make adjustments, and it points you back in the right direction.</p>
    <p>A trading plan is your trading GPS. It will show you where you currently are as a trader and help you get to your destination:&nbsp;<strong>consistent profitability</strong>.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/junior-gps3.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>Traveling without a GPS wouldn&rsquo;t be a smart idea. You wouldn&rsquo;t know how to get to your destination and it&rsquo;s highly likely that you&rsquo;ll drive around lost like a chicken with its head chopped off.</p>
    <p>You&rsquo;re probably thinking that one could use an ancient object called &ldquo;maps&rdquo; instead, but we have no clue what that is. Please don&rsquo;t make such absurd suggestions again.</p>
    <p>Trading without a trading plan would be the same thing as driving without a GPS&ndash;a bad idea.</p>
    <p>You&rsquo;re trying to get to this Promised Land called &ldquo;Consistent Profits,&rdquo; but since you have no way of knowing whether you&rsquo;re headed in the right direction, you&rsquo;ll most likely end up blowing out your account.</p>
    <p><strong>With a trading plan, you&rsquo;re able to know if you&rsquo;re headed in the right direction.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>You&rsquo;ll have a framework to measure your trading performance.</strong>&nbsp;And just like a GPS, you&rsquo;re able to monitor this continually.</p>
    <p>This allows you to trade with less emotion and stress.</p>
    <h2>Do NOT be a Cowboy Trader!</h2>
    <p>Without a trading plan, this would be nearly impossible. Instead, you&rsquo;d be a &ldquo;<strong>cowboy trader</strong>&ldquo;, shooting from the hip, trading by the seat of your pants, relying on your gut, guesses, or signals from strangers.</p>
    <p>That ain&rsquo;t trading &ndash; that&rsquo;s gambling!</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2010/09/gambling-gene.gif" alt="" /></p>
    <p>Whenever you trade, you&rsquo;ll probably end up a nervous, emotional wreck, crying yourself to sleep as your rollercoaster account balance grinds at your psyche. (Okay pretty drastic, but we think you get the picture).</p>
    <p>Just as you use a GPS to figure out the route to be taken and to judge the progress that has been made, your trading plan defines how you&rsquo;ll become consistently profitable and tells you if you&rsquo;re on track.</p>
    <p>Most importantly, if you suck at trading (and you certainly will in the beginning), you will know it is down to one of only two reasons: either&nbsp;<strong>there&rsquo;s a problem in your trading plan</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>you are not sticking to your trading plan</strong>.</p>
    <p>If you&rsquo;re trading without a plan, it&rsquo;s impossible to know what you&rsquo;re doing right from wrong.</p>
    <p>You have no way to evaluate your results, so you&rsquo;ll never know how to stop sucking.</p>
    <p>We can&rsquo;t emphasize this enough&hellip;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;<strong>If you fail to plan, then you&rsquo;ve already planned to fail.</strong>&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Obviously, a trading plan doesn&rsquo;t guarantee success, but a good plan that is followed will help you stay in the forex game longer than traders who don&rsquo;t have a trading plan.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/junior-survival2.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p><strong>SURVIVAL</strong>&nbsp;is better than failure and it should be your first goal as a newbie trader.</p>
    <p>Remember,&nbsp;90%&nbsp;of new traders don&rsquo;t make it. You want to be part of that special &ldquo;10%&rdquo; that does make it.</p>
    <p>You&rsquo;re probably thinking, &ldquo;Ba humbug! Trading plan, schmading plan. I can be part of that 10% without a stinkin&rsquo; trading plan!&rdquo;</p>
    <p>It may be tempting to trade by the seat of your pants, but if you don&rsquo;t develop clearly defined trading plans and be disciplined enough to follow them consistently, you&rsquo;ll have much difficulty making consistent money as a trader.</p>
    <p>Don&rsquo;t take any chances.&nbsp;<strong>Have a trading plan</strong>.</p>
