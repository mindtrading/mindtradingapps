    <p>Now that you&rsquo;re about halfway through our College of Forex, here&rsquo;s one piece of advice you should always remember.</p>
    <p><strong>Be your own trader.</strong></p>
    <p>In other words:&nbsp;<strong>Don&rsquo;t follow someone else&rsquo;s trading advice blindly!</strong></p>
    <p>Just because someone may be doing well with their method, it doesn&rsquo;t mean it will work for you.</p>
    <p>We&rsquo;re all in different situations in life, and we all have different market views, thought processes, risk tolerance levels, and market experiences.</p>
    <p>Have your own&nbsp;<strong>personalized trading plan</strong>&nbsp;and update it as you learn from the market.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/senior-muscle-man.png" alt="" /><em>With rock solid discipline, your trading could look like this.</em></p>
    <p>Developing a Trading Plan and sticking to it are the two main ingredients of&nbsp;<strong>trading discipline</strong>.</p>
    <p>But trading discipline&nbsp;isn&rsquo;t enough. Even solid trading discipline isn&rsquo;t enough.</p>
    <p>It has to be&nbsp;<strong>rock solid</strong>&nbsp;discipline.</p>
    <p>We repeat:&nbsp;<strong>rock solid</strong>.</p>
    <p>Like a brick wall.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2010/09/04154320/trading-plan-solid.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p><em>&ldquo;Call me Mr. Discipline.&rdquo;</em></p>
    <p>Plastic solid discipline won&rsquo;t do. Nor will discipline made from straws and sticks. We don&rsquo;t want to be little piggies.</p>
    <p>We want to be successful traders!</p>
    <p>And having a&nbsp;<strong>brick solid trading discipline</strong>&nbsp;is the most important characteristic of successful traders.</p>
    <p>A&nbsp;<strong>trading plan</strong>&nbsp;defines what is supposed to be done, why, when, and how. It covers your trader personality, personal expectations, risk management rules, and trading system(s).</p>
    <p>When followed, a trading plan will help limit trading mistakes and minimize your losses.</p>
    <p>After all, &ldquo;<strong>If you fail to plan, then you&rsquo;ve already planned to fail.</strong>&rdquo;</p>
    <p>A trading plan removes any bad decision-making in the heat of the moment.</p>
    <p>Your&nbsp;<strong>emotions</strong>&nbsp;can consume you when money is on the line, causing you to make irrational decisions. You don&rsquo;t want that to happen.</p>
    <p>The best way to prevent it from happening is to&nbsp;<em>minimize</em>&nbsp;(notice we did not say eliminate) thinking by having a plan for every potential market action.</p>
    <p>With the right trading plan, every action is spelled out, so that in the heat of the moment you don&rsquo;t have to make any rash decisions.</p>
    <p>You just simply stick to your trading plan.</p>
    <h2>The Difference Between a Trading Plan and a Trading System</h2>
    <p>Before we continue, we have to quickly distinguish the difference between a trading plan and a trading system.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>A&nbsp;<strong>trading system</strong>&nbsp;describes how you will enter and exit trades.</li>
    <li>A<strong>&nbsp;trading system&nbsp;</strong>is PART of your&nbsp;<strong>trading plan</strong>&nbsp;but is just one of several important parts, i.e., analysis, executions, risk management, etc.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Since market conditions are always changing, a good trader will usually have&nbsp;<strong>two or more trading systems</strong>&nbsp;in his or her trading plan.</p>
    <p>Trading systems will be covered more in-depth later on in the lesson, but we thought that it was important to point out the difference between the two upfront to avoid any confusion.</p>
