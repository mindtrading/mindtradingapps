    <p>A forex trading plan is only effective if it&rsquo;s followed.</p>
    <p><strong>You have to stick to it.</strong></p>
    <p>It sounds simple to do. It is really just common sense but most traders still can&rsquo;t do it.</p>
    <p>Why, oh, why?</p>
    <p><strong>Trader incompatibility.</strong></p>
    <p>A trading plan should be a personalized plan for you, a plan that fits your own goals, risk tolerances, and individual lifestyle.</p>
    <p>You must develop each component on an individual basis, never losing sight of the fact that it must be custom-tailored to YOU and YOUR needs.</p>
    <p>Not your girlfriend&rsquo;s. Not your boyfriend&rsquo;s.</p>
    <p>Not even Ronald, your weirdo best friend whose head is shaped like a hamburger who likes to wear pink polka dot pants and is an aspiring rapper.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/junior-hamburger-head.png"  /></p>
    <p>Your trading plan must be made based on reality, not on hope.</p>
    <p>If you&rsquo;re simply trying to copy somebody else&rsquo;s trading plan or yours is based on false assumptions, then you will not be compatible with it and will have trouble following it.</p>
    <p>SOLUTION:&nbsp;<strong>Be honest with yourself. Then revise your trading plan.</strong></p>
    <p>Trading plans are intended to be long-term.</p>
    <p>Many forex traders give up on their trading plan, or often more specifically, the trading system&nbsp;<em>in</em>&nbsp;the trading plan.</p>
    <p>Why?</p>
    <p>They are unable to endure a string of losses. Rather than sticking it out through the inevitable rough times, they give up.</p>
    <p>SOLUTION::&nbsp;<strong>Be patient!</strong></p>
    <p>Trading according to a plan requires sticking to it through thick and thin. That takes discipline. Rock solid discipline.</p>
    <p>Forex traders lacking discipline do not stick to their trading plans. You need to be disciplined. Rock solid. Does it sound like we&rsquo;re beating a dead horse? Well, good.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2010/09/04154320/trading-plan-solid.png" /></p>
    <p>SOLUTION:&nbsp;<strong>Stay disciplined!</strong></p>
    <p>Self-destructive behavior: Some forex traders have deeply ingrained psychological issues that will sabotage them.</p>
    <p>This can be resolved with hard work on one&rsquo;s self, but the trader must be self-aware of such issues first. You can&rsquo;t figure out a solution if you don&rsquo;t know the root problem.</p>
    <p><strong>When you stop following your trading plan, you become rewarded for a lack of discipline and you may start believing that abandoning a trading plan is no big deal.</strong></p>
    <p>An unjustified reward may increase your tendency to abandon trading plans in the future. You may be prone to think &ldquo;<em>I was rewarded once; maybe I will be rewarded again. I&rsquo;ll take a chance.</em>&rdquo;</p>
    <p>But the positive outcomes of undisciplined trading are usually short-lived, and a lack of discipline ultimately produces forex trading losses.</p>
    <p><strong>Distinguish justified wins from unjustified wins.</strong></p>
    <p>A justified win is when you create a very detailed trading plan and FOLLOW the plan. A win that results from following a trading plan is justified and reinforces discipline.</p>
    <p><img title="Trade Victory" src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2010/09/31180447/victory-360x360.png" />An&nbsp;<strong>unjustified</strong>&nbsp;win occurs when you drift from or completely ditch the plan. You might be rewarded, but the outcome occurred by chance.</p>
    <p>You might as well flip a coin or hang a printed copy of your charts on the wall and throw darts at it to help you make trading decisions. The win is unjustified and can reinforce undisciplined trading.</p>
    <p>SOLUTION:&nbsp;<strong>Look in the mirror. Hopefully, you don&rsquo;t turn to stone.</strong></p>
    <p>If you&rsquo;re personally having trouble sticking to your trading plan, most likely it&rsquo;s one of the reasons above. If it is, refer to the solution below it.</p>
    <h2>Consistency is key!</h2>
    <p>Maintaining discipline is vital for consistent and profitable forex trading.</p>
    <p>Trading is a matter of&nbsp;<strong>getting the law of averages to work in your favor</strong>.</p>
    <p>The winning trader is one who first develops the skill to make the shot consistently so that at every possible opportunity, the ball is likely to go through the basket.</p>
    <p>One must trade consistently following a specific trading plan on each and every single trade.</p>
    <p>If you trade one approach this time, and a different approach at another time, your performance will likely be all over the place, too.</p>
    <p>What&rsquo;s more, you&rsquo;ll have a more difficult time pinpointing which strategy works and which doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
    <p><strong>With discipline comes profitability. Don&rsquo;t let unjustified wins interfere with your ability to maintain discipline.</strong></p>
    <p>Follow your trading plan, and cement in the mindset that if you follow your plan, you will end up more profitable in the long run.</p>
