    <p>What is your daily pre-trading routine?</p>
    <p>Waking up doesn&rsquo;t count.</p>
    <p>Having a&nbsp;<strong>pre-market routine</strong>&nbsp;is important.</p>
    <p>Don&rsquo;t think you can just jump out of bed, plop in front of your computer, fire up your forex broker&rsquo;s platform and start easily grabbing pips as if they were apples from a very short apple tree.</p>
    <h2>What activities will you do BEFORE you start trading?</h2>
    <p>We don&rsquo;t mean showering and brushing your teeth.</p>
    <p>Although you should always take a shower and brush your teeth. You don&rsquo;t wanna smell like Pipcrawler now do you?</p>

    <ul>
    <li>Reviewing any open positions and making any necessary adjustments</li>
    <li>Reviewing yesterday&rsquo;s trades</li>
    <li>Getting yourself &ldquo;up to speed&rdquo; on the market</li>
    <li>Identifying any upcoming news that could cause volatility</li>
    <li>Being ready to trade when the next trading session opens</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Now you will want to review the overall market news. This can be done online through sites such as Bloomberg&nbsp;or through television (CNBC, Bloomberg TV, BBC).</p>
    <p>Determine what the&nbsp;<strong>overall market sentiment</strong>&nbsp;is for the day, review yesterday&rsquo;s trades and how the previous trading session finished, and maybe identify key market areas like support and resistance.</p>
    <p>Now it&rsquo;s time to start trading your system!</p>
    <p><strong>Your pre-market routine will be critical to your success as a trader</strong>.</p>
    <p>It will help you plan your day so that you are not spending time during market hours scrambling trying to figure out what news or data will be coming out, and what to do if the market does something you didn&rsquo;t expect.</p>
