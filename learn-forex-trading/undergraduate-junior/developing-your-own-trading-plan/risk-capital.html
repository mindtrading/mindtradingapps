    <p>How are your personal finances?</p>
    <p>You need to determine if you can even afford to trade.</p>
    <p>Forex trading should only be done with&nbsp;<strong>risk capital</strong>.</p>
    <p>Risk capital is&nbsp;<strong>money</strong>&nbsp;that, if lost completely, would not have an overly harmful impact on you financially.</p>

    <p><strong>Risk capital is money that you can lose.</strong></p>
    <p>This is the kind of money that if you lost, you wouldn&rsquo;t lose your home, car, spouse, limbs, electricity, etc.</p>
    <p><strong>Don&rsquo;t risk what you can&rsquo;t afford to lose!</strong></p>
    <p><img title="Forex Risk Capital" src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/junior-broke-dude.png" />If you&rsquo;re playing with money that you need to pay the bills, it will have a huge negative impact on your ability to make objective trading decisions.</p>
    <p>Imagine how stressed you&rsquo;ll be while your trade is open knowing you might not be able to put on the food on the table if you get stopped out.</p>
    <p>Every time a pip goes against you, you&rsquo;ll be thinking, &ldquo;There goes tomorrow&rsquo;s lunch!&rdquo;</p>
    <p>You don&rsquo;t want to end up starving, homeless, and broke now, do you?</p>
    <p>Unless you do.</p>
    <p>In that case, go ahead and risk all your hard-earned money in forex.</p>
    <p>Don&rsquo;t be stupid!</p>
    <p>If you can&rsquo;t afford to make dough in the kitchen, then you can&rsquo;t afford to make dough in the forex market.</p>
    <p>Use your brain.</p>

    <p>Don&rsquo;t start trading forex with real money until you&rsquo;ve accumulated enough risk capital. Until then&hellip;</p>
    <p>Stick to demo trading!</p>
    <p>Later on, we&rsquo;ll teach you all about risk management and how you should manage your risk capital.</p>
