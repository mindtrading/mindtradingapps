    <p>The difference between making money and losing money can be as simple as&nbsp;<strong>trading with a plan or trading without one</strong>.</p>
    <p>A trading plan is an&nbsp;<strong>organized approach</strong>&nbsp;to executing a trading system that you&rsquo;ve developed based on your market analysis and outlook while factoring in risk management and personal psychology.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/junior-trading-blueprint.png"  />No matter how good your trading plan is, it won&rsquo;t work if you don&rsquo;t follow it.</p>
    <p>Forex traders who follow a disciplined approach are the ones who survive year after year after year.</p>
    <p>They can even have more losing trades than winning ones and still be profitable because they follow a disciplined approach.</p>
    <p>Here is a summary of what the key benefits are:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Trading that is simpler with a plan than it is without one.</li>
    <li>Reduced stress means better health.</li>
    <li>Ability to gauge your performance, identify problems, and make corrections.</li>
    <li>A trading plan helps to prevent many psychological issues from taking root.</li>
    <li>A trading plan that is adhered to strictly will reduce the number of bad trades.</li>
    <li>A trading plan will help prevent irrational behavior in the heat of the moment.</li>
    <li>A trading plan enables you to control the only thing you can control&hellip; yourself!</li>
    <li>A trading plan will instill a large measure of discipline into your trading. Gamblers lack both discipline and a trading plan.</li>
    <li>A plan will enable you to trade outside your comfort zone. How many times have you let a loss run and cut a profit short because it was a comfortable thing to do? A plan, executed with discipline, will help to prevent this from happening.</li>
    <li>A plan is your GPS which will enable you to get from wherever you are now to wherever you want to be: consistent profitability.</li>
    <li>Your trading plan is designed in such a way that if you do take a &ldquo;wrong turn,&rdquo; you will know about it very quickly and have the opportunity to correct the problem before losses spiral out of control.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>One last thing before you head off to your next class&hellip;</p>
    <p>Always remember that the trading plan is a&nbsp;<strong>work in progress</strong>.</p>
    <p>The market environment is not static. It&rsquo;s dynamic and constantly changing. As things change, your trading plan must change, too.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2010/09/mike-tyson-plan.png" /></p>
    <p>Assess your trading plan and processes periodically, especially when you have changes in your financial or life situation.</p>
    <p>Also, as your research leads to changes in your trading system or methods, be sure to reflect those adjustments in your forex trading plan.</p>
    <p><strong>Adapt and survive.</strong></p>
    <p>Remember, the main purpose of the trading plan is to keep you on task and to operate in an effective and efficient manner to&nbsp;<strong>make good trading decision</strong>s.</p>
    <p>It is, however, only as good as you make it, and it is completely useless if it is not applied in practice.</p>
