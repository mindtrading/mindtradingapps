    <p>One of the leading causes for the failure of many businesses is their lack of planning.</p>
    <p>If you want to be successful in life and business, you need to have a plan for how to obtain that success.</p>
    <p><strong>Trading is no different from any other business.</strong></p>
    <p>It is important to have a written business plan for your trading just as you would for any other business.</p>

    <p>Like we mentioned in the previous lesson&hellip;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;<strong>If you fail to plan, then you&rsquo;ve already planned to fail.</strong>&rdquo;</p>
    <p>In other words, those who fail to plan out their trading like a business are doomed to fail.</p>
    <p>Here are twenty-one&nbsp;<em>crucial</em>&nbsp;questions that you should have an answer to as part of your trading plan.</p>
    <ol>
    <li>What are your specific reasons for wanting to become a trader?</li>
    <li>What do you hope to gain from trading?&nbsp;</li>
    <li>What are your biggest strengths?</li>
    <li>What are your biggest weaknesses?</li>
    <li>How do you plan to address your weaknesses and leverage your strengths?</li>
    <li>&nbsp;What are the things that are going to separate you from the large majority of traders who fail? (Answering with &ldquo;hard work&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t enough. Lots of hard-working traders still fail.)</li>
    <li>Will the things you mentioned above actually give you an edge in the markets so your trading outcomes generate a positive expectancy?</li>
    <li>What market or markets do you plan to trade and why?</li>
    <li>How much time can you devote to actively following the FX market? And the overall financial market?</li>
    <li>What is your trading style?&nbsp;Do you plan to scalp, day trade, swing trade, or position trade?&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Do the trading style(s) you&rsquo;ve chosen reflect the reality of the amount of time that you can devote to trading?</li>
    <li>At what times throughout the day (or week) are you going to spend actually trading, researching trades, and then learning about the market?</li>
    <li>What trading system(s) will you be using (your criteria for entering and exiting trades)?</li>
    <li>What is your risk management&nbsp;strategy?</li>
    <li>How will you know if your trading system or strategy stops working?</li>
    <li>After you&rsquo;ve identified that your trading system or strategy has stopped working, what will you do to address it?</li>
    <li>What trading software and equipment you will use to trade and how much is it?</li>
    <li>Who will you use to access the markets? What broker(s) will you use?</li>
    <li>How much money do you plan to start to trade with? Is this money you can afford to lose without negatively affecting your current standard of living?</li>
    <li>Do you plan to add money to your account and if so where is that money going to come from?</li>
    <li>If you are profitable, do you plan to reinvest profits or withdraw some or all of them?</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If you&rsquo;re really serious about trading, take time to ponder the questions above.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2020/05/31190702/trading-plan-questions.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>Growth and success need&nbsp;<strong>direction</strong>&nbsp;and a&nbsp;<strong>sense of purpose</strong>. Which must first be&nbsp;<em>identified</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>clearly stated</em>. They won&rsquo;t appear on their own.</p>
    <p>A clear roadmap forces&nbsp;<strong>accountability and responsibility,</strong>&nbsp;which sometimes may lead to a change in the plan (like when your trading system or strategy stops working). This is fine, but you won&rsquo;t know that change is even needed unless you&rsquo;ve established in clear terms, what&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;considered &ldquo;working&rdquo; and &ldquo;not working&rdquo;.</p>
    <p><strong>Risks can be turned into opportunities, but first, you need to have identified what the risks are</strong>. If not, when they arrive as a crisis, you&rsquo;ll be on your back foot, most likely panic, and make poor (and unprofitable) decisions.</p>
    <p>As you can see, there are many things to consider before hitting that buy or sell button in your trading platform.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Answering each question will not guarantee trading success, but NOT answering such questions will almost certainly guarantee failure.</p>
    <p>The choice is yours.</p>
    <p>Results are usually proportional to the quality of the planning.</p>
    <p>Don&rsquo;t set yourself set up for failure. Set yourself up for success.</p>
