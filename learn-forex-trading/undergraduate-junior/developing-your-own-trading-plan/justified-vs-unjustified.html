    <p>What&rsquo;s wrong with deviating from your forex trading plan if you make a profit anyway?</p>
    <p>Making an occasional winning trade, even when you throw your trading plan out the window, may provide a short-term pleasure, but entering trades haphazardly can adversely influence your ability to maintain discipline in the long term.</p>
    <p><strong>Trading is a marathon, not a sprint!</strong></p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2010/09/marathon-not-s-sprint.jpg" alt="" /></p>
    <p>When you stop following your trading plan, you become rewarded for&nbsp;<strong>lacking discipline</strong>&nbsp;and you may start believing that abandoning a trading plan is no big deal.</p>
    <p>An unjustified reward may increase your tendency to abandon trading plans in the future.</p>
    <p>You may be prone to think &ldquo;I was rewarded once, maybe I will be rewarded again. I&rsquo;ll take a chance.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>But the positive outcomes of undisciplined trading are usually short-lived, and a lack of discipline ultimately&nbsp;<strong>produces long-term trading losses</strong>.</p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s important to distinguish&nbsp;<strong>justified</strong>&nbsp;wins from&nbsp;<strong>unjustified</strong>&nbsp;wins.</p>
    <p>A&nbsp;<strong>justified win</strong>&nbsp;is when you create a very detailed trading plan and FOLLOW the plan. A win that results from following a trading plan is justified and reinforces discipline.</p>
    <p>An&nbsp;<strong>unjustified win</strong>&nbsp;occurs when you make a plan but don&rsquo;t follow it or if you have no plan at all. You might be rewarded, but the outcome occurred by chance.</p>
    <p>You might as well flip a coin or hang a printed copy of your charts on the wall and throw darts at it to help you make trading decisions.</p>
    <p><strong>The win is unjustified and can reinforce undisciplined trading.</strong></p>
    <p>Maintaining discipline is vital for consistent and profitable trading.</p>
    <p><strong>Trading is a matter of getting the law of averages&nbsp;to work in your favor.</strong></p>
    <p>You trade proven forex trading strategies, over and over, so that across a series of trades, the strategies work enough to produce an overall profit.</p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s like making shot after shot on the basketball court so as to accumulate a winning number of points. The more shots you take, the more likely you will amass points. Just look at Steph Curry.</p>
    <p>The winning player is the person who first develops the skill to make the shot c<strong>onsistently</strong>&nbsp;so that at every possible opportunity, the ball is likely to go through the basket.</p>
    <p>They&rsquo;ve developed the skill to learn how to shoot the ball the same way every single time. Consistency is crucial!</p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s the same for trading. One must trade consistently, following a specific trading plan on each and every single trade.</p>
    <p>If you trade one approach this time, and a different approach at another time, your performance will more than likely be haphazard.</p>
    <p>We can&rsquo;t stress this enough&hellip;</p>
    <p><strong>You have to allow the law of averages to work in your favor so that across a series of trades, you will make an overall profit.</strong></p>
    <p>If you follow the plan sometimes and abandon it at other times, you throw off the probabilities, and you will most likely end up losing overall.</p>
    <p><strong>With trading discipline comes profitability.</strong></p>
    <p>Don&rsquo;t let unjustified wins interfere with your ability to maintain discipline.</p>
    <p><strong>Follow your own trading plan</strong>, and cement in the mindset that if you follow your plan, you will end up more profitable in the long run.</p>
    <p>Now that we&rsquo;re done explaining how important a trading plan is (can we stress this enough?), it&rsquo;s time for you to learn what should go inside a good trading plan.</p>
