    <p><strong>I want to make some money!</strong></p>
    <p>Ahhh. Of course, anybody who&rsquo;s interested in forex trading&nbsp;certainly has ambitions of raking in some dough.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2010/09/04155855/forex-trader-successful.png" /></p>
    <p>Trading involves risk, and we expect to be compensated for those risks.</p>
    <p>There&rsquo;s no doubt that every currency trader expects to make a profit.</p>
    <p>The questions that you should ask yourself though are this:</p>
    <p><strong>What kind of returns do I expect to make? And how much risk am I willing to take to get these returns?</strong></p>
    <p>Your answer to these questions will play a huge role in determining what kind of trading style you will implement, what currency pairs and times you will trade, and most importantly, the risks involved in achieving your goals.</p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s look at an example to help explain this better.</p>
    <h2>Mario and Luigi</h2>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s say there are two forex traders, Mario and Luigi.</p>
    <p>Luigi is looking to score 10% a year while Mario is a little more ambitious&hellip;</p>
    <p>He wants to DOUBLE his account and make 100% returns!</p>
    <p>And marry a super hawt princess.</p>
    <p>As you can imagine, a trader like Mario, who is looking to double his account, is in a very different situation.</p>
    <p>It is very likely that Mario will have to&nbsp;<strong>take a lot more trades and/or risk</strong>&nbsp;more than Luigi.</p>
    <p>He will have to&nbsp;<strong>expose himself to more potential losses</strong>&nbsp;if he ever wants to achieve his goal of 100% returns.</p>
    <p>Traders will also have to take into consideration&nbsp;<strong>drawdowns</strong>.</p>
    <p>A&nbsp;<strong>drawdown</strong>&nbsp;is normally calculated as the distance from the highest value of your account to the next lowest point. (We&rsquo;ll explain this a little bit more in a later lesson. For now, pay attention in class!)</p>
    <p>Each forex&nbsp;trader must decide how big of a drawdown he or she can accept in order to hit their profit target goals.</p>
    <p>On the one hand, there are forex traders who are risk-averse and would rather have small drawdowns. The tradeoff is that this will also limit potential profits.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, there are forex traders who are comfortable with large drawdowns, just as long as their system also yields huge returns.</p>
    <p>You will also have to take into consideration&nbsp;<strong>how much time you can dedicate to trading</strong>.</p>
    <p>If you can&rsquo;t dedicate a significant amount of time working on your trading system, reading up on the financial markets and learning new trading techniques, recording/reviewing your trade journal, then we can guarantee you that you will have a difficult time hitting your goals.</p>
    <p>If you can&rsquo;t make this time commitment, you may have to readjust your expectations as to how much you can make your account grow.</p>
    <p>In the end, just know that success depends on YOU.</p>
    <p>Do you have the discipline to GRIND it out consistently to tweak your skills and gain the experience needed to navigate the markets?</p>
    <p>If you don&rsquo;t, then expect&nbsp;<strong>inconsistent returns</strong>, if any at all, over the long term.</p>
