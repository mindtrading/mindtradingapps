    <p><strong>Why do you want to become a forex trader?</strong></p>
    <p>Is it to become filthy rich? Is it for the thrill?</p>
    <p>Is it because you want to do something challenging and exciting?</p>
    <p>Is it because the girl you like trades currencies and you want to impress her?</p>

    <p>It is important to know what your true motivation is, or whether you should even be trading at all.</p>
    <p><strong>Forex traders who aren&rsquo;t serious or committed to the craft will be quickly eliminated by the market.</strong></p>
    <p>For example, seeking thrills and seeking consistent profits don&rsquo;t go together.</p>
    <p>You might enjoy the thrill of putting on a humungous &ldquo;I&rsquo;m betting the farm&rdquo; position, but believe us, you won&rsquo;t be smiling once your trade blows up in your face.</p>
    <p>If thrills are what you seek, go to a casino, jump out of a plane or try driving an F1 racing car.</p>
    <p>Better yet, if you want a real thrill, drive an F1 racing car out of a plane and land in a casino.</p>
    <p>Now that&rsquo;s a real thrill! And you might even lose less money than if you were trading.</p>

    <h2>What have you determined to be your goal(s) for trading?</h2>
    <p>This can be expressed monetarily using a profit goal (either in currency or percent return) per unit of time.</p>
    <p>For example, you might choose a goal like making $4,223,834,145.53 per month, or achieving a 529% return every week.</p>
    <p>This doesn&rsquo;t necessarily have anything to do with money.</p>
    <p>Like &ldquo;My goal for trading is to make enough money to be able to buy them new Space Jam Jordan 11s so I can impress my lady crush and she can fall in love with me and we can live happily ever after.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Or &ldquo;My goal is to have enough money to have plastic surgery so that I can look like Halle Berry and have everyone eating out of my hands.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Okay.</p>
    <p>We lied.</p>
    <p>Everything has to do with money.</p>
    <p>Whatever you decide, just make sure it&rsquo;s specific and measurable.</p>
    <p><strong>Set trading goals that will help you develop as a trader.</strong></p>
    <p>It can&rsquo;t be vague like &ldquo;I want to be rich&rdquo;.</p>
    <p>Changing it to &ldquo;I want to be super rich.&rdquo; does not count.</p>
    <p><strong>Be specific!</strong></p>
    <p>&ldquo;I want to make 1% every week.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;I want to be winning 50% of the time by the end of this year.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;I want to double my account in six months.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to make any trading mistakes for the day.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>By making your goals specific and measurable, not only will you know what you really want, but you&rsquo;ll be able to monitor your progress and see whether you are improving or not.</p>
    <p>If they are not&nbsp;<strong>specific</strong>, you&rsquo;re just wasting your time.</p>
