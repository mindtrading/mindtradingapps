    <p>What &ldquo;toys&rdquo; will you use for your forex trading profession?</p>
    <p>Write down the hardware, software, data feeds, furniture, and internet access that will comprise your currency &ldquo;trading desk.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Don&rsquo;t forget backups! Make sure you have a backup plan for everything just in case your main tools fail while you&rsquo;re in a trade.</p>
    <p>What if your computer crashes and doesn&rsquo;t boot back up?</p>
    <p>What if your internet connection goes down?</p>
    <p>What if your electricity goes out?</p>
    <p>What if your keyboard stops working?</p>

    <p>Finally, don&rsquo;t get suckered by all the razzle-dazzle currency trading vendors (*cough* scammers! *cough*) try to lure you with.</p>
    <p>Do you really need that $5,000 chart pattern recognition software that displays in 4D IMAX?</p>
    <p>Probably not. Save your money and use it for trading capital instead.</p>
    <h2>Which broker platform should I use?</h2>
    <p>Where will you execute your trades? It&rsquo;s not like you can call the bank and say, &ldquo;I want to go long EUR/USD.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Okay fine, you could have done this in the past (if you had a million dollars), but we&rsquo;re living in the 21st century now.</p>
    <p>Time to get up to speed and use those online trading platforms!</p>
    <p>But it isn&rsquo;t that simple.</p>
    <p>Make sure you know the ins and outs of the broker you choose from executing orders to depositing and (hopefully) withdrawing money.</p>
    <p>Take the time to read our &ldquo;Choosing a Forex Broker&rdquo; lesson. You won&rsquo;t regret it!</p>
