    <p>The entry trigger tells you when to &ldquo;fire!&rdquo;</p>
    <p><strong>Your entry trigger tells you that once you&rsquo;re in the potential trade area when to actually enter the trade.</strong></p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/junior-entry-trigger.png" /></p>
    <p>This is your specific entry technique.</p>
    <p>Now that you&rsquo;ve decided on where you&rsquo;re looking to enter a trade, now you have to decide how to actually enter the trade.</p>
    <p>Do you just blindly enter? If you want to cross the street, do you simply just start walking across?</p>
    <p>Only if you want to possibly get run over. Of course, you look both ways first to make sure it&rsquo;s &ldquo;safe&rdquo;.</p>
    <p>This same approach is also practical with trading. You want to make sure it is &ldquo;safe&rdquo; to enter the market (i.e. a high probability trade setup).</p>
    <p><strong>The entry technique will help keep you out of trades that aren&rsquo;t behaving the way you would expect in your potential trade area.</strong></p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s pretend your potential trade area is where bearish divergence is present.</p>
    <p>Do you just automatically short? Or do you wait for the price to trade near a significant resistance level first?</p>
    <p>Maybe even wait for an exhaustion reversal candlestick like a shooting star to form?</p>
    <p>Instead of waiting&hellip;.you short now, and then watch the price climb higher and get stopped out.</p>
    <p>Just because you find a good area to trade doesn&rsquo;t mean you should just jump right in.</p>
    <p><strong>A good entry technique provides that solid confirmation to help keep you out of losing trades.</strong></p>
    <p>Again, make a screenshot of your chart and label where your entry trigger is.</p>
    <p>Don&rsquo;t forget that you must&nbsp;<strong>combine a good entry trigger with a good potential trade area</strong>.</p>
    <p>A moving average crossover may be a popular entry technique but if you don&rsquo;t factor in the area in which you&rsquo;re thinking of entering, you will probably be whipsawed&nbsp;to death.</p>
    <p>Using an entry trigger as a &ldquo;stand-alone&rdquo; technique is a recipe for disaster.</p>
    <p>Make sure you&rsquo;re aware of your &ldquo;surroundings&rdquo; as well. Don&rsquo;t bring a knife to a gunfight.</p>
