    <p>After a good number of trades, you will have collected a lot of fancy-schmancy data and observations on the market and yourself&hellip;how do you analyze it all??</p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s pretty simple:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Find what works and keep doing it</li>
    <li>Find out what doesn&rsquo;t work and stop doing it.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>And finding what works and doesn&rsquo;t work is all about keen observation and asking the right questions.</p>
    <p>Refine your analysis of your trading results by breaking them down into smaller categories, such as day of the week or specific currency pairs.</p>

    <p>Here&rsquo;s a sample of the types of questions you should be asking yourself when you review your journal:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Which chart patterns or technical indicators work out best for you? Which do not?</li>
    <li>How can you adjust your indicators to get you in trades earlier, or help you avoid whipsaws and fakeouts?</li>
    <li>Are you closing winning trades too early? Is it that you need to adjust your profit targets or are you afraid of losing your unrealized gains?</li>
    <li>Do you hold onto losing trades longer than you should? How can you improve your stop-loss processes?</li>
    <li>How often do you follow your trading plans?&nbsp;Of the ones you do follow, have you been profitable?</li>
    <li>What trade setup did you miss, or not take, and why? Was it a legitimate signal or setup according to my method or system?</li>
    <li>What could you have done differently to make prevent/reduce this loss or maximize your gain?</li>
    <li>Are you winning more on trades with multiple lots or single lots?</li>
    <li>What kind of market environments&nbsp;have you been doing well in? Trending or ranging?</li>
    <li>Were most of your wins or losses biased towards certain currency pairs?</li>
    <li>Which news events&nbsp;have brought on the kind of volatility you were looking to trade or avoid?</li>
    <li>Which trading sessions&nbsp;have been the most favorable to your trading style?</li>
    <li>Are you losing trades concentrated on certain days of the week, such as Mondays and Fridays?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Questions like these can help you quickly filter out the actions that have kept you from making some pips.</p>
    <p>In the beginning, the idea is to get to the point where you have figured out what works for you and to only do those things.</p>
    <p>Once you have figured out those right things, the next step is to consistently practice those actions that work until it becomes a habit.</p>
    <p>Finally, persistent journaling will help keep you on top of your performance and help you recognize when the markets change&ndash;and yes the markets are always changing.</p>
