    <p><strong>Keeping a trading journal is hard.</strong></p>
    <p>But so is losing all your trading capital, failing as a forex trader, giving up, never to return to forex trading ever again.</p>
    <p>And reminiscing about the good &lsquo;ol simpler days of being happy&nbsp;when there were only five TV channels to choose from.</p>

    <p>Which would you rather choose?</p>
    <p>Entering trades in a journal forces you to view the trades in black and white, rather than simply relying on your memory, which for most humans, is a stretch.</p>
    <p>More importantly, a trading journal allows a trader to step back and view their trades as a&nbsp;<strong>group of trades</strong>, and not as individual and ultimately random transactions.</p>
    <p>Boy, this sounds like a lot of work, doesn&rsquo;t it?</p>
    <p>Heck ya, it is, but doesn&rsquo;t anything worth achieving require work?!?</p>
    <p>Keeping a&nbsp;trading&nbsp;journal is the equivalent of an athlete&rsquo;s practice.</p>
    <p><strong>It&rsquo;s not uncommon for a professional athlete to spend far more time practicing or training for an event than actually participating in it.</strong></p>
    <p>According to Tim Grover, Michael Jordan&rsquo;s personal physical trainer:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Michael would go for 40 or 50 points one night, and the next morning he was right back at it in practice. He just couldn&rsquo;t take a day off. His mental toughness was unbelievable, but the reason was that he was so physically ready every day. He used to have a saying, &lsquo;I practice so hard because that makes the games easy for me.'&rdquo;</p>
    <p>John Wooden, winner of a record 10 NCAA Men&rsquo;s Basketball Championships, and known as one the greatest minds basketball has ever known, ran a very strict and disciplined two-hour practice, 5 days a week, in preparation for a 40-minute basketball game.</p>
    <p>Do you know who much time that is? That&rsquo;s 10 hours (or 600 minutes) of practice for 40 minutes of the real thing.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/junior-practice-makes-perfect.png"  /><br />And that&rsquo;s not all! Not only did he stress meticulous and deliberate practice,&nbsp;but he also kept a LOG of how every practice went.</p>
    <p>Coach Wooden would refer to his practice logs if his team had a problem he couldn&rsquo;t solve.</p>
    <p>For example, if his current team was shooting poorly, he would research his old practice logs to determine how they could improve their shooting.</p>
    <p>Even in the days of no computers or iPads, Coach Wooden understood the importance of strict record keeping!</p>
    <p>While the act of journaling really isn&rsquo;t that hard, it is a time-intensive process that will require consistent&nbsp;<strong>effort</strong>.</p>
