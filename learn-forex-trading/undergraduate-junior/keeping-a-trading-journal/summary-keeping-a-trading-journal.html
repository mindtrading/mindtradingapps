    <p>Your&nbsp;<strong>trade journal</strong>&nbsp;is a log of all trading activity.</p>
    <p>A trading journal provides any serious trader who wishes to make money a tool to help them evaluate themselves objectively.</p>
    <p>There are three elements for sustained successful trading:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Having and executing a good trading PLAN.</li>
    <li>Having a good trading system as part of that plan.</li>
    <li>Review and improve your trading performance and plans.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2010/08/trade-journaling.png" />Every forex trader should maintain a journal that focuses on these elements.</p>
    <p>This journal&rsquo;s objective is to monitor both the performance of your trading system AND your ability to execute it with consistency.</p>
    <p>Poor trading systems are less frequently the cause of poor trading performance than the inability of the trader to properly&nbsp;<strong>follow the rules</strong>&nbsp;of the trading system.</p>
    <p>That&rsquo;s following the Trading Plan. Your trading journal is intended to make sure you do just that.</p>
    <p>Journals are only as good as what is written in them. If one fails to accurately track trades, it becomes hard to judge trading performance.</p>
    <p>This should be ongoing efforts, not just a one-off for the sake of completing an assignment.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2010/08/no-excuses.png" />Be thorough and honest. Do not short-change YOURSELF by failing to put in entries or through incompleteness.</p>
    <p>Learning to write and maintain a trading journal will build discipline in you.</p>
    <p>Not only that, when you reflect on your entries after a month of trading, we guarantee you will learn a lot about yourself and your trading psychology.</p>
    <p>You&rsquo;ll clearly see what you&rsquo;re good at, what you suck at, and what the best way it is for YOU to trade.</p>
    <p>This is something that no mentor, no book, no video, no seminar can teach you. You have to experience it yourself. Only through this experience will you become a successful trader.</p>
    <p>To build the skill of trading, you must have the will to maintain a trading journal.</p>

    <p>Here&rsquo;s some final advice for keeping a helpful trading journal:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Always begin the journal before the trade, and end it after the trade.</strong></li>
    <li>Write down everything. Don&rsquo;t leave anything out. Be honest. If you decided to play Call of Duty while you were in a trade and forgot to exit your trade, write that down, and explain why.</li>
    <li>Pay very close attention to your emotions. Then make sure you write them down.</li>
    <li>Make sure the journal includes observations about you and your trading and about the forex market. We&rsquo;ve found that trading journals are usually skewed toward self-analysis and include little in the way of market observation.</li>
    <li>Take a screenshot of intraday charts of each day&rsquo;s action and write comments on them. Make note of patterns that you are watching</li>
    <li>After a couple of months, you will start to see the patterns emerging in real-time.</li>
    <li>A trading journal is a learning tool and a great mechanism for training your eye to see the setups you want to be trading.</li>
    <li>Nothing is too silly to record inside your journal. Write it down. Write down whether you missed a trade because you were watching the latest episode of The Crown or playing Call of Duty&nbsp;or you were busy talking to your sweetheart. Write it all down!</li>
    </ul>
