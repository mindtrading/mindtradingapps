    <p>Being<strong>&nbsp;retrospective</strong>&nbsp;means to take a look back at events that already have taken place.</p>
    <p>Once you&rsquo;ve finished trading, it might be tempting to call up yo homies to hit up happy hour, kick back shots of Patr&oacute;n, and splurge on bottles of Dom P&eacute;rignon, but it&rsquo;s crucial that you review how your trade went, win or lose.</p>
    <p>You want to look back over the whole process to understand what you did right and wrong.</p>
    <p>Here are some questions to ask yourself:</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/junior-retrospective.png" /></p>
    <h2>How well did your trade work out?</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Was the position size&nbsp;sufficient to match the risk and reward scenarios, or was it too large? Too small?</li>
    <li>Could you have entered at a better level?</li>
    <li>What tools might you have used to improve your entry timing?</li>
    <li>Were you patient enough or did you rush in thinking you&rsquo;d never have a chance again?</li>
    <li>Was your take profit realistic or a&nbsp;pie in the sky?</li>
    <li>Did the market pay any respect to your choice of take-profit levels, such as stopping short of it, or did prices blow right through it?</li>
    <li>Did the market pay any respect to your choice of stop-loss levels, such as stopping short of it, or did prices blow right through it?</li>
    <li>What news or event catalysts caused the market to move the way it did?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Use the answers to refine your position size, entry level, and order placement going forward.</p>
    <h2>How well did you manage the trade after it was open?</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Were you able to effectively monitor the market while your trade was active? If so, how? If not, why not? The answers to these questions will reveal a lot about how much time and dedication you&rsquo;re able to devote to your trading.</li>
    <li>Did you modify your trade plan along the way?</li>
    <li>Did you adjust your stop loss order to protect profits?</li>
    <li>Did you take partial profit at all?</li>
    <li>Did you close out your trade based on your&nbsp;trading plan, or did the market surprise you somehow?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Based on your answers, you&rsquo;ll learn what role your emotions may have played and how disciplined a trader you are.</p>
    <p>While you may want to vent your thoughts, emotions, and feeling to yo homies, it&rsquo;s better to write them down here.</p>
    <p>You are probably boring them to death anyway. They don&rsquo;t want to hear your whining.</p>
    <h2>What can you improve and what specific steps will you take for improvement?</h2>
    <p>This is your opportunity for trader self-improvement.</p>
    <p>Do not just write vague confessions like &ldquo;I need to hold my winners longer&rdquo; or &ldquo;I need to cut my losses quicker&rdquo; or &ldquo;I need to be more disciplined&rdquo;. These are totally&nbsp;<em>useless</em>&nbsp;by themselves.</p>
    <p>Identify SPECIFIC steps that you will take to improve.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>How will hold your winners longer?</li>
    <li>Will you work on choosing a better profit target?</li>
    <li>Will you learn how to not freak out at the first sign of your unrealized profits falling?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>There are no right or wrong answers in this review process.</p>
    <p>Just be as honest with yourself as you can be.</p>
    <p>And be SPECIFIC.</p>
    <p>Otherwise, you won&rsquo;t improve as a forex trader.</p>
    <h2>Did you execute your trade according to your trading plan?</h2>
    <p>DO NOT TAKE THIS QUESTION LIGHTLY.</p>
    <p>If you are not routinely executing trades according to your plan, then you either have a serious problem with self‚Äêdiscipline or there is a problem with your Trading Plan.</p>
    <p>Either way, you have a BIG problem that needs to be fixed yesterday!</p>
