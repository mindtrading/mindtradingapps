    <p>You need to keep a&nbsp;<strong>trading journal</strong>.</p>
    <p>Journaling?!?</p>
    <p>Isn&rsquo;t that only for silly high school girls who write about their silly crushes on silly high school boys?</p>
    <p>Heck ya!</p>
    <p>Ok, not really&hellip; high school girls keep DIARIES.</p>
    <p>Boys also (we don&rsquo;t discriminate).</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/junior-trading-journal.png"  />Forex traders keep trading&nbsp;<strong>JOURNALS</strong>.</p>
    <p>Two entirely different things! Get it right! Geez!</p>
    <p>Keeping a trading journal is actually a crucial task in any performance or goal-oriented endeavor. The key is to have some way to measure, track, and stay focused on improving your performance.</p>
    <p>World-class athletes do it to keep track of what helps them to be better, faster, and stronger on the field or court.</p>
    <p>Scientists do it in the process of finding their next greatest discovery. And forex traders do it to help get them duckets!</p>
    <p>What &ldquo;getting them duckets&rdquo; means in simple terms is to become disciplined, consistent, and most importantly, profitable.</p>
    <p><strong>A disciplined trader is a profitable trader and keeping a trading journal is the first step to building your discipline.</strong></p>
    <p>This might sound simple or easy but we assure you that to actually get started can be very difficult.</p>
    <p>In fact, many forex traders give up after a while and rely on the logs that the forex broker provides.</p>
    <p>The logs or transaction history from your forex broker gives information that is, at best, marginally useful as it doesn&rsquo;t tell you much of&nbsp;<strong>WHY</strong>&nbsp;you entered and exited the trade.</p>
    <p>That information provides&nbsp;<strong>NO</strong>&nbsp;help to your next trade.</p>
    <p>Zero. Zilch. Nein. Nada.</p>
    <p>A trading journal isn&rsquo;t just about writing in the prices of your entry and exit and the time you executed the trade.</p>
    <p>The trading journal is also about refining your methods and mastering your own psychology.</p>
    <p>To be even more specific, it is about your&nbsp;<strong>individual emotional psychology before, during, and after the trade.</strong></p>
    <p>For example, your trading method says to buy USD/JPY.</p>
    <p><strong>But</strong>&nbsp;your gut feeling tells you that the trade is&nbsp;<strong>NOT</strong>&nbsp;going to work&hellip;</p>
    <p>So you remind yourself, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think this trade is going to work. BUT I have to follow my trading plan so I&rsquo;ll take it.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>During the middle of your trade, the price comes 3 pips away from your stop loss and you&rsquo;re thinking, &ldquo;<strong>OMG. This trade isn&rsquo;t looking so good. I knew it! Why didn&rsquo;t I listen to myself? I&rsquo;m such an idiot! I&rsquo;m about to lose here! I&rsquo;ll just exit now.</strong>&rdquo;</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2010/09/my-trade-is-losing.png"  /></p>
    <p>You then decide to close your trade.</p>
    <p>A few moments later the price shoots to your original profit target. Had you stayed in the trade you would have made a gazillion pips!</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2010/09/trade-wouldve-won.png"  /></p>
    <p>This is why you should write a trading journal. This is a classic case that probably happens to too many traders.</p>
    <p><strong>We fail to stay in the trade, we fail to trade the plan, and most importantly, we fail to distance our emotions from our trading!</strong></p>
    <p>If you keep trading like that and you don&rsquo;t keep a trading journal, the balance on your trading account will become a big fat&nbsp;ZERO&nbsp;before you realize what you&rsquo;re doing wrong.</p>
