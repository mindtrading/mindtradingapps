    <p>The 5-wave trends are then corrected and reversed by<strong>&nbsp;3-wave countertrends</strong>.</p>
    <p>Letters are used instead of numbers to track the correction.</p>
    <p>Check out this example of a smokin&rsquo; hot corrective 3-wave pattern!</p>

    <p>Just because we&rsquo;ve been using a bull market as my primary example doesn&rsquo;t mean the Elliott Wave Theory doesn&rsquo;t work on bear markets.</p>
    <p>The same&nbsp;<strong>5-3 wave pattern</strong>&nbsp;can look like this:</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade9-reverse-abc-correction.png" alt="" /></p>
    <h2>Types of Corrective Wave Patterns</h2>
    <p>According to Elliott, there are 21 corrective ABC patterns ranging from simple to complex.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Uh, 21? I can&rsquo;t memorize all of that! The basics of the Elliott Wave Theory are already mind-blowing!&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Take it easy, young padawan. The great thing about Elliott Wave is you don&rsquo;t have to be above the legal drinking age to trade it!</p>
    <p>You don&rsquo;t have to get a fake ID or memorize all 21 types of corrective ABC patterns because they are just made up of three very simple easy-to-understand formations.</p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at these three formations. The examples below apply to uptrends, but you can just invert them if you&rsquo;re dealing with a downtrend.</p>
    <h2>The Zig-Zag Formation</h2>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade9-elliott-wave-zigzags.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>Zig-zag formations are very steep moves in price that go against the predominant trend.</p>
    <p>Wave B is typically shortest in length compared to Waves A and C.</p>
    <p>These zig-zag patterns can happen twice or even thrice in a correction (2 to 3 zig-zag patterns linked together).</p>
    <p>Like with all waves, each of the waves in zig-zag patterns could be broken up into 5-wave patterns.</p>
    <h2>The Flat Formation</h2>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade9-elliott-wave-flats.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>Flat formations are simple sideways corrective waves.</p>
    <p>In flats, the lengths of the waves are&nbsp;<strong>GENERALLY</strong>&nbsp;equal in length, with wave B reversing wave A&rsquo;s move and wave C undoing wave B&rsquo;s move.</p>
    <p>We say generally because wave B can sometimes go beyond the beginning of wave A.</p>
    <h2>The Triangle Formation</h2>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade9-elliott-wave-triangle.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>Triangle formations are corrective patterns that are bound by either converging or diverging trend lines.</p>
    <p>Triangles are made up of 5-waves that move against the trend in a sideways fashion. These triangles can be symmetrical, descending, ascending, or expanding.</p>
