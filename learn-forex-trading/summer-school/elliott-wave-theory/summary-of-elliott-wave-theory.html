    <p>Here&rsquo;s a summary of what we covered regarding the&nbsp;<strong>Elliott Wave Theory</strong>:</p>
    <h2>Elliott Waves are fractals.</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Each wave can be split into parts, each of which is a very similar copy of the whole. Mathematicians like to call this property &ldquo;self-similarity&rdquo;.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>A trending market moves in a 5-3 wave pattern.</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>The first 5-wave pattern is called&nbsp;<strong>impulse</strong>&nbsp;wave.</li>
    <li>One of the three impulse waves (1, 3, or 5) will always be extended. Wave 3 is usually the extended one.</li>
    <li>The second 3-wave pattern is called a&nbsp;<strong>corrective</strong>&nbsp;wave. Letters A, B, and C are used instead of numbers to track the correction.</li>
    <li>Waves 1, 3 and 5, are made up of a smaller 5-wave impulse pattern while Waves 2 and 4 are made up of smaller 3-wave corrective patterns.</li>
    <li>There are 21 types of corrective patterns but they are just made up of three very simple, easy-to-understand formations.</li>
    <li>The three fundamental corrective wave patterns are&nbsp;<strong>zig-zags</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>flats</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>triangles</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Three Cardinal Rules</h2>
    <p>There are three cardinal rules in Elliott Wave Theory when labeling waves:</p>
    <p><strong>Rule Number 1:</strong>&nbsp;Wave 3 can NEVER be the shortest impulse wave</p>
    <p><strong>Rule Number 2:</strong>&nbsp;Wave 2 can NEVER go beyond the start of Wave 1</p>
    <p><strong>Rule Number 3:</strong>&nbsp;Wave 4 can NEVER cross in the same price area as Wave 1</p>
    <p>If you look hard enough at a chart, you&rsquo;ll see that the market really does move in waves.</p>
    <p>Because the forex market never moves in a textbook-perfect fashion, it will take many, many hours of practice analyzing waves before you start to get comfortable with Elliott waves.</p>
    <p>Stay diligent and never give up!</p>
