    <p>This is probably what you all have been waiting for &ndash; drumroll please &ndash; using the&nbsp;<strong>Elliott Wave Theory</strong>&nbsp;in forex trading!</p>
    <p>As an Elliott Wave trader, you will be spotting &ldquo;wave counts.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>This means that you will be labeling the waves to see how they conform to the Elliott Wave pattern, to try and anticipate future price movement.</p>
    <p>In this section, we will look at some setups and apply our knowledge of Elliott Wave to determine entry, stop loss, and exit points.&nbsp;Surfs up!</p>

    <h2>Hypothetical, will-most-probably-be-right scenario #1:</h2>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s say you wanted to begin your wave count. You see that price seems to have bottomed out and has begun a new move upwards.</p>
    <p>Using your knowledge of Elliott Wave, you label this move up as Wave 1 and the retracement as Wave 2.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade9-elliott-wave-start.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>In order to find a good entry point, you head back to the School of Pipsology to find out which of the three cardinal rules and guidelines you could apply. Here&rsquo;s what you found out:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Rule Number #2</strong>: Wave 2 can NEVER go beyond the start of Wave 1</li>
    <li>Waves 2 and 4 frequently&nbsp;<strong>bounce off Fibonacci retracement levels</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>So, using your superior Elliott Wave trading skillz, you decide to pop the Fibonacci tool to see if the price is at a Fib level. Holy mama!</p>
    <p>Price is just chillin&rsquo; like ice cream fillin&rsquo; around the 50% level. Hmm, this could be the start of Wave 3, which is a very strong buy signal.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade9-elliott-wave-fibs.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>Since you&rsquo;re a smart forex trader, you also take your stop into consideration.</p>
    <p>Cardinal rule number 2 states that Wave 2 can never go beyond the start of Wave 1 so you set your stop below the former lows.</p>
    <p>If the price retraces more than 100% of Wave 1, then your wave count is wrong.</p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s see what happens next&hellip;</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade9-elliott-wave-end.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>Your Elliott Wave analysis paid off and you caught a huge upward move!</p>
    <p>You go to Las Vegas (or Macau), overconfident that everything you touch is a winner, blow all your forex profits on roulette, and end right back where you started.</p>
    <p>There are no Elliot Waves in a casino.</p>
    <p>Lucky for you&hellip;we have another hypothetical scenario where you can earn imaginary money again&hellip;</p>
    <h2>Scenario 2:</h2>
    <p>This time, let&rsquo;s use your knowledge on corrective wave patterns to grab those pips.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade9-elliott-wave-flat-example.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>You begin counting the waves on a downtrend and you notice that the ABC corrective waves are moving sideways.</p>
    <p>Hmm, is this a&nbsp;<strong>flat formation</strong>&nbsp;in the works? This means that price may just begin a new impulse wave once Wave C ends.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade9-elliott-wave-entry1.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>Trusting your Elliott Wave skills, you go ahead and sell at the market price in hopes of catching a new impulse wave.</p>
    <p>You place your stop just a couple of pips above the start of Wave 4 just in case your wave count is wrong.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade9-elliot-wave-exit.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>Because we like happy endings, your trade idea based on the Elliott Wave Theory works out and nets you a couple of thousand pips on this day, which is not always the case.</p>
    <p>You have also learned your lesson this time around so you skip Vegas and decide to use your profits to grow your forex trading capital&nbsp;instead.</p>
