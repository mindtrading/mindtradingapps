    <p>As you may have guessed, the key to using the Elliott Wave Theory in trading is all about being able to&nbsp;<strong>correctly identify waves</strong>.</p>
    <p>By developing the right eye in recognizing what wave the market is in, you will be able to find out which side of the market to trade on, long or short.</p>
    <p>There are THREE cardinal &ldquo;cannot-be-broken&rdquo; rules in labeling waves.</p>
    <p>So, before you jump right into applying the Elliott Wave Theory to your trading, you must take note of the rules below.</p>
    <p>Failing to label waves correctly can prove disastrous to your account.</p>
    <h2>3 Cardinal Rules of the Elliott Wave Theory</h2>
    <p><strong>Rule Number #1:</strong>&nbsp;Wave 3 can NEVER be the shortest impulse wave</p>
    <p><strong>Rule Number #2:</strong>&nbsp;Wave 2 can NEVER go beyond the start of Wave 1</p>
    <p><strong>Rule Number #3:</strong>&nbsp;Wave 4 can NEVER cross in the same price area as Wave 1</p>
    <h2>Elliott Wave Trading Guidelines</h2>
    <p>Then, there are guidelines that help you&nbsp;correctly label waves.</p>
    <p>Unlike the three cardinal rules, these guidelines can be broken. Here they are:</p>
    <p>Sometimes, Wave 5 does not move beyond the end of wave 3. This is called&nbsp;<strong>truncation</strong>.</p>
    <p>Wave 5, more often than not, goes beyond or &ldquo;breaks through&rdquo; the trend line drawn off Wave 3 parallel to a trend line connecting the start of Waves 3 and 5.</p>
    <p>Wave 3 tends to be very long, sharp and extended.</p>
    <p>Waves 2 and 4 frequently bounce off Fibonacci retracement levels.</p>
