    <p>As you may have guessed, profiting off&nbsp;<strong>Harmonic Price Patterns</strong>&nbsp;is all about being able to spot those &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; patterns and buying or selling on their completion.</p>
    <p>There are three basic steps in spotting Harmonic Price Patterns:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Step 1:</strong>&nbsp;Locate a potential Harmonic Price Pattern</li>
    <li><strong>Step 2:</strong>&nbsp;Measure the potential Harmonic Price Pattern</li>
    <li><strong>Step 3:</strong>&nbsp;Buy or sell on the completion of the Harmonic Price Pattern</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By following these three basic steps, you can find high probability setups that will help you grab those oh-so-lovely pips.</p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s see this process in action!</p>
    <h2>Step 1: Locate a potential Harmonic Price Pattern</h2>

    <p>Oh wow, that looks like a potential Harmonic Price Pattern!</p>
    <p>At this point in time, we&rsquo;re not exactly sure what kind of pattern that is.</p>
    <p>It LOOKS like a three-drive, but it could be a Bat or a Crab&hellip;</p>
    <p>Heck, it could even be a Moose!&nbsp;ðŸ¦Œ</p>
    <p>In any case, let&rsquo;s label those reversal points.</p>
    <h2>Step 2: Measure the potential Harmonic Price Pattern</h2>
    <p>Using the Fibonacci tool, a pen, and a piece of paper, let&rsquo;s list down our observations.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade10-harmonic-example2.png" alt="" /></p>
    <ol>
    <li>Move&nbsp;<strong>BC</strong>&nbsp;is .618 retracement of move AB.</li>
    <li>Move&nbsp;<strong>CD</strong>&nbsp;is 1.272 extension of move BC.</li>
    <li>The length of AB is roughly equal to the length of CD.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>This pattern qualifies for a bullish ABCD pattern, which is a strong buy signal.</p>
    <h2>Step 3: Buy or sell on the completion of the Harmonic Price Pattern</h2>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade10-harmonic-example3.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>Once the pattern is complete, all you have to do is respond appropriately with a buy or sell order.</p>
    <p>In this case, you should buy at point D, which is the 1.272 Fibonacci extension of move CB, and put your stop loss a couple of pips below your entry price.</p>
    <p>Is it really that easy?</p>
    <p>Not exactly.</p>
    <p>The problem with harmonic price patterns is that they are so perfect that they are so difficult to spot, kind of like a diamond in the rough.</p>
    <p>More than knowing the steps, you need to have hawk-like eyes to spot potential harmonic price patterns and a lot of patience to avoid jumping the gun and entering before the pattern is completed.</p>
