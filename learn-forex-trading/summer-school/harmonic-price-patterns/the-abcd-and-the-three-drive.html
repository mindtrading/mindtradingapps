    <h2>The ABCD</h2>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s start this lesson with the simplest harmonic pattern. So what could be more basic than the&nbsp;good old ABCs?</p>
    <p>We&rsquo;ll just pop in another letter at the end&nbsp;(because we&rsquo;re cool like that), and we&rsquo;ve got the ABCD chart pattern! That was easy!</p>
    <p>To spot this chart pattern, all you need are ultra-sharp hawk eyes and the handy-dandy Fibonacci chart tool.</p>
    <p>For both the bullish and bearish versions of the ABCD chart pattern, the lines AB and CD are known as the&nbsp;<strong>legs</strong>&nbsp;while BC is called the&nbsp;<strong>correction</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>retracement</strong>.</p>
    <p>If you use the Fibonacci retracement tool on leg AB, the retracement BC should reach the 0.618 level. Next, the line CD should be the 1.272 Fibonacci extension of BC.</p>
    <p>Simple, right? All you have to do is wait for the entire pattern to complete (reach point D) before taking any short or long positions.</p>

    <p>Oh, but if you want to be extra strict about it, here are a couple more rules for a valid ABCD pattern:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>The length of line AB should be equal to the length of line CD.</li>
    <li>The time it takes for the price to go from A to B should be equal to the time it takes for the price to move from C to D.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Three-Drive</h2>
    <p>The three-drive pattern is a lot like the ABCD pattern except that it has three legs (now known as drives) and two corrections or retracements.</p>
    <p>Easy as pie! In fact, this three-drive pattern is the ancestor of the Elliott Wave pattern.</p>
    <p>As usual, you&rsquo;ll need your hawk eyes, the Fibonacci tool, and a smidge of patience on this one.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade10-bearish-three-drive.gif" alt="" /></p>
    <p>As you can see from the charts above, point A should be the 61.8% retracement of drive 1. Similarly, point B should be the 0.618 retracement of drive 2.</p>
    <p>Then, drive 2 should be the 1.272 extension of correction A and drive 3 should be the 1.272 extension of correction B.</p>
    <p>By the time the whole three-drive pattern is complete, that&rsquo;s when you can pull the trigger on your long or short trade.</p>
    <p>Typically, when the price reaches point B, you can already set your short or long orders at the 1.272 extension so that you won&rsquo;t miss out!</p>
    <p>But first, it&rsquo;d be better to check if these rules also hold true:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>The time it takes the price to complete drive 2 should be equal to the time it takes to complete drive 3.</li>
    <li>Also, the time to complete retracements A and B should be equal.</li>
    </ul>
