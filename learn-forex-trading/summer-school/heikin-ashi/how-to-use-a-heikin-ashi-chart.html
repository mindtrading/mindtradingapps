    <p>How do you use Heikin Ashi?</p>
    <p>Now that you&rsquo;ve learned how to calculate Heikin Ashi candlesticks, let&rsquo;s discuss&nbsp;<strong>how to use and read a Heikin Ashi candlestick chart</strong>.</p>
    <p>The idea behind using a Heikin Ashi chart is that it&nbsp;<strong>filters market noise</strong>.</p>
    <p>And since noise is filtered, you basically see the&nbsp;<strong>naked trend</strong>.</p>

    <p>Because the Heikin Ashi candlesticks are calculated based on&nbsp;<strong>averages</strong>, the candlesticks will have smaller shadows (wicks) than a regular Japanese candlestick.</p>
    <p>Just like with regular Japanese candlesticks, with a Heikin Ashi candlestick, the smaller (or shorter) the shadow (or wick), the stronger the trend.</p>
    <p><strong>Green candle</strong>s with no lower shadow signal a strong UPTREND.</p>
    <p><strong>Red candles</strong>&nbsp;with no upper shadow signal a strong DOWNTREND.</p>

    <p>Heikin Ashi charts are used by technical traders to IDENTIFY:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Trend DIRECTION</li>
    <li>Trend STRENGTH</li>
    </ul>
    <p>So If your goal is to catch trends and ride them as long as possible, then you may want to learn how to use a Heikin Ashi chart.</p>
    <h2>How to Use Heikin Ashi to Identify Trend Direction</h2>
    <p>A Heikin Ashi chart shows you the direction of a trend&nbsp;<strong>through its color-coded candles</strong>.</p>
    <p>A green candle is telling you that trend is UP.&nbsp;A red candle is telling you that the trend is DOWN.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2020/04/18180234/heikin-ashi-trend-direction-780x442.png" alt="" /></p>
    <h2>How to Use Heikin Ashi to Identify Trend Strength</h2>
    <p>A Heikin Ashi chart&nbsp;shows you the strength of the trend by&nbsp;<strong>observing the shadows (or wicks)</strong>.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2020/04/18181031/heikin-ashi-trend-strength-780x442.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>You&rsquo;ll notice that for many of the green candles,<strong>&nbsp;there is no lower shadow</strong>&nbsp;or wick.</p>
    <p>Vice versa for the red candles. Most&nbsp;<strong>do not have any upper shadows</strong>&nbsp;or wicks.</p>
    <p>These candlesticks do not show a shadow in the&nbsp;<em>OPPOSITE&nbsp;</em>direction of the trend.</p>
    <p><strong>When there is no shadow, this means you&rsquo;re in a strong trend</strong>.</p>
    <p>So the main thing you want to look for on a Heikin Ashi chart to determine trend strength is&nbsp;<strong>shadowless or wickless candlesticks opposite the trend.</strong></p>
    <p>Candlesticks that have no shadow or wick on one end are also called &ldquo;<strong>shaved candles</strong>&ldquo;.</p>
    <p>Depending on which end lacks a shadow, there&rsquo;s a name for each type of shaved candle.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2020/04/18192134/shaved-bottom-and-shaved-head-607x780.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>If there is no lower shadow/wick, also known as having &ldquo;no tail&rdquo;, the candle is called a &ldquo;<strong>shaved bottom</strong>&ldquo;.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2020/04/24210950/shaved-bottom.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>&ldquo;<strong>Shaved butt</strong>&rdquo; would&rsquo;ve been a better name in our opinion.&nbsp;ðŸ¤£</p>
    <p>If there is no upper shadow/wick, also known as having &ldquo;no head&rdquo;, the candle is called a &ldquo;<strong>shaved head</strong>&ldquo;.</p>
    <p>Technically, the color of the candle does NOT matter, as long a candle lacks a tail or head, but for the purposes of Heikin Ashi, we want to see&nbsp;<strong>shaved bottoms that are green</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>shaved heads that are red</strong>&nbsp;since we&rsquo;re looking for trend strength.</p>
