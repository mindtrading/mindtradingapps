    <p><strong>Heikin Ashi?</strong></p>
    <p>You&rsquo;re probably familiar with the three popular&nbsp;chart types:&nbsp;<strong>line chart</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>bar chart</strong>, and the&nbsp;<strong>candlestick chart</strong>.</p>
    <p>But there&rsquo;s another type of chart that you should know about that uses a totally different technique to display price action.</p>
    <p>The&nbsp;<strong>Heikin Ashi</strong>.</p>
    <p>Like the beer?</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2020/04/19145224/heikin-ashi-beer.jpg" alt="" /></p>
    <p>Umm nope. Let&rsquo;s focus now. We&rsquo;re NOT talking about beer here!</p>
    <p>We&rsquo;re talking about CHARTS! (Although the spelling does seem pretty close.&nbsp;ðŸ¤”)</p>
    <p>&ldquo;<strong>Heikin Ashi</strong>&rdquo;, also known as &ldquo;<strong>Heikin-Ashi</strong>&rdquo; or &ldquo;<strong>Heiken Ashi</strong>&rdquo; is a charting technique used to display prices that, at a glance, looks&nbsp;<em>similar</em>&nbsp;to a traditional Japanese candlestick chart.</p>
    <p>The difference is the method used in&nbsp;<strong>how candlesticks are calculated and plotted</strong>&nbsp;on a chart.</p>
    <p>Traditional Japanese candlesticks&nbsp;are great at helping you find good entry points since they display potential reversals (like a shooting star)&nbsp;or breakout (like a bullish marubozu closing above a resistance level).</p>
    <p>But what about once you&rsquo;re IN a trade?</p>
    <p>Applying the Heikin Ashi technique to a price chart can help you decide whether to&nbsp;<strong>stay in the trade or get out</strong>.</p>
    <p>Heikin Ashi charts make candlestick charts&nbsp;<strong>more readable</strong>&nbsp;for traders who want to know when to stay in a trade and ride a strong trend and when to get out when the trend weakens.</p>
    <p>Basically, Heikin Ashi is a&nbsp;<strong>modified candlestick charting technique</strong>&nbsp;that&nbsp;<em>rearranges</em>&nbsp;how the price is displayed so trend traders can have a higher confidence level when deciding whether to remain in a trade or exit.</p>
    <p>Some traders, usually longer-term traders, use Heikin Ashi charts as an&nbsp;<strong><em>alternative</em>&nbsp;to traditional Japanese candlestick charts</strong>.</p>
    <p>Other traders use them&nbsp;<strong><em>in conjunction</em>&nbsp;with traditional Japanese candlestick charts,</strong>&nbsp;switching back-and-forth between the two.</p>
    <h2>What is Heikin Ashi?</h2>
    <p>In Japanese, Heikin means &ldquo;average&rdquo; and Ashi means &ldquo;pace&rdquo;. So together,&nbsp;<strong>Heikin Ashi means the &ldquo;average pace of price&rdquo;.</strong></p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2020/04/24210508/japan.png" alt="" />Heikin Ashi is a type of candlestick charting technique used to&nbsp;<strong>help filter market noise</strong>.</p>
    <p>The Heikin Ashi technique was created hundreds of years ago by&nbsp;<strong>Munehisa Homma</strong>, a rice merchant from Sakata, Japan, who is considered the father of the candlestick chart.</p>
    <p>So Darth Vader is to Luke Skywalker, as Munehisa Homma is to Heikin Ashi.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2020/04/18142743/vader.gif" alt="" /></p>
    <p>Homma realized that by tracking the price action in the rice market, he could actually &ldquo;see&rdquo; the psychological behavior of other market participants, and make use of it.</p>
    <p>Here&rsquo;s an example of a&nbsp;<strong>Heikin Ashi chart</strong>:</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2020/04/18143540/Heikin-Ashi-example-780x442.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>To the untrained eye, the chart&nbsp;<em>looks</em>&nbsp;like your typical Japanese candlestick chart.</p>
    <p>Each Heiki Ashi candlestick has a&nbsp;<strong>body</strong>&nbsp;and an upper and/or lower&nbsp;<strong>shadow</strong>&nbsp;(or&nbsp;<strong>wick</strong>).</p>

    <p>They&rsquo;re the same right?</p>
    <p>Nope.</p>
    <p>There&rsquo;s a BIG difference between the two types of candlestick charts.</p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s learn what that difference is.</p>
