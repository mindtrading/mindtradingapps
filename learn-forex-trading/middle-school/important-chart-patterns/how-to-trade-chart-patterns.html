    <p>That&rsquo;s a whole lot of chart patterns&nbsp;we just taught you right there. We&rsquo;re pretty tired so it&rsquo;s time for us to take off and leave it to you from here&hellip;</p>
    <p>Just playin&rsquo;! We ain&rsquo;t leaving you till you&rsquo;re ready!</p>
    <p>In this section, we&rsquo;ll discuss a bit more about how to use these chart patterns to your advantage.</p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s not enough to just know how the tools work, we&rsquo;ve got to learn how to use them. And with all these new weapons in your arsenal, we&rsquo;d better get those profits fired up!</p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s summarize the chart patterns we just learned and categorize them according to the signals they give.</p>
    <h2>Reversal Chart Patterns</h2>
    <p><strong>Reversal</strong>&nbsp;patterns are those chart formations that signal that the ongoing trend is about to change course.</p>
    <p>If a reversal chart pattern forms during an uptrend, it hints that the trend will&nbsp;<em>reverse</em>&nbsp;and that the price will head down soon.</p>
    <p>Conversely, if a reversal chart pattern is seen during a downtrend, it suggests that the price will move up later on.</p>
    <p>In this lesson, we covered six chart patterns that give reversal signals. Can you name all six of them?</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Double Top</li>
    <li>Double Bottom</li>
    <li>Head and Shoulders</li>
    <li>Inverse Head and Shoulders</li>
    <li>Rising Wedge</li>
    <li>Falling Wedge</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If you got all six right, brownie points for you!</p>

    <p>To trade these chart patterns, simply place an order beyond the neckline and in the direction of the new trend. Then go for a target that&rsquo;s almost the same as the height of the formation.</p>
    <p>For instance, if you see a double bottom, place a long order at the top of the formation&rsquo;s neckline and go for a target that&rsquo;s just as high as the distance from the bottoms to the neckline.</p>
    <p>In the interest of proper risk management, don&rsquo;t forget to place your stops! A reasonable stop loss can be set around the middle of the chart formation.</p>
    <p>For example, you can measure the distance of the double bottoms from the neckline, divide that by two, and use that as the size of your stop.</p>
    <h2>Continuation Chart Patterns</h2>
    <p><strong>Continuation</strong>&nbsp;chart patterns are those chart formations that signal that the ongoing trend will resume.</p>
    <p>Usually, these are also known as&nbsp;<strong>consolidation patterns</strong>&nbsp;because they show how buyers or sellers take a quick break before moving further in the same direction as the prior trend.</p>
    <p>Trends don&rsquo;t usually move in a straight line higher or lower. They pause and move sideways, &ldquo;correct&rdquo; lower or higher, and then regain momentum to&nbsp;<em>continue</em>&nbsp;the overall trend.</p>
    <p>We&rsquo;ve covered several continuation chart patterns,&nbsp;namely the wedges, rectangles, and pennants. Note that wedges can be considered either reversal or continuation patterns depending on the trend on which they form.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade7-falling-wedge-continuation.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade7-rising-wedge-continuation.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>To trade these patterns, simply place an order above or below the formation (following the direction of the ongoing trend, of course).</p>
    <p>Then go for a target that&rsquo;s at least the size of the chart pattern for wedges and rectangles.</p>
    <p>For pennants, you can aim higher and target the height of the pennant&rsquo;s mast.</p>
    <p>For continuation patterns, stops are usually placed above or below the actual chart formation.</p>
    <p>For example, when trading a bearish rectangle, place your stop a few pips above the top or resistance of the rectangle.</p>
    <h2>Bilateral Chart Patterns</h2>
    <p><strong>Bilateral</strong>&nbsp;chart patterns are a bit more tricky because these signal that the price can move EITHER way.</p>
    <p>Huh? What kind of a signal is that?!</p>
    <p>A bilateral signal.</p>
    <p>This is where triangle formations fall in. Remember when we discussed that the price could break&nbsp;<strong>either to the topside or downside</strong>&nbsp;with triangles?</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade7-ascending-triangle.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>To play these chart patterns, you should consider&nbsp;<strong>both scenarios</strong>&nbsp;(upside or downside breakout) and place one order on top of the formation and another at the bottom of the formation.</p>
    <p>If one order gets triggered, you can cancel the other one. Either way, you&rsquo;d be part of the action.</p>
    <p>Double the possibilities, double the fun!</p>
    <p>The only problem is that you could catch a&nbsp;<strong>false break</strong>&nbsp;if you set your entry orders too&nbsp;<em>close</em>&nbsp;to the top or bottom of the formation.</p>
    <p>So be careful and don&rsquo;t forget to place your&nbsp;<strong>stops</strong>&nbsp;too!</p>
