    <p>When a double top or double bottom chart pattern appears, a&nbsp;<strong>trend reversal</strong>&nbsp;has begun.</p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s learn how to identify these chart patterns and trade them.</p>
    <h2>Double Top</h2>
    <p>A double top is a reversal pattern that is formed after there is an extended move up.</p>
    <p>The &ldquo;tops&rdquo; are peaks that are formed when the price hits a certain level that can&rsquo;t be broken.</p>
    <p>After hitting this level, the price will bounce off it slightly, but then return back to test the level again.</p>
    <p>If the price bounces off of t<em>hat level again, then you have a DOUBLE top!</em></p>

    <p>In the chart above you can see that two peaks or &ldquo;tops&rdquo; were formed after a strong move up.</p>
    <p>Notice how the second top was not able to break the high of the first top.</p>
    <p>This is a strong sign that a reversal is going to occur because it is telling us that the buying pressure is just about finished.</p>
    <p>With the double top, we would place our entry order below the neckline because we are anticipating a reversal of the uptrend.</p>

    <p>Wow! We must be psychic or something because we always seem to be right!</p>
    <p>Looking at the chart you can see that the price breaks the neckline and makes a nice move down.</p>
    <p>Remember that double tops are a trend reversal formation so you&rsquo;ll want to look for these after there is a strong uptrend.</p>
    <p>You&rsquo;ll also notice that the drop is approximately the same height as the double top formation.</p>
    <p>Keep that in mind because that&rsquo;ll be useful in setting profit targets.</p>
    <h2>Double Bottom</h2>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade7-big-butts.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>The double bottom is also a trend reversal formation, but this time we are looking to go long instead of short.</p>
    <p>These formations occur after extended downtrends when two valleys or &ldquo;bottoms&rdquo; have been formed.</p>

    <p>You can see from the chart above that after the previous downtrend, the price formed two valleys because it wasn&rsquo;t able to go below a certain level.</p>
    <p>Notice how the second bottom wasn&rsquo;t able to significantly break the first bottom.</p>
    <p>This is a sign that the selling pressure is about finished, and that a reversal is about to occur.</p>

    <p>Will you look at that!</p>
    <p>The price broke the neckline and made a nice move up.</p>
    <p>See how the price jumped by almost the same height as that of the double bottom formation?</p>
    <p>Remember, just like double tops, double bottoms are also&nbsp;<strong>trend reversal</strong>&nbsp;formations.</p>
    <p>You&rsquo;ll want to look for these after a strong downtrend.</p>
