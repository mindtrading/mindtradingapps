    <p>Similar to rectangles, pennants are continuation chart patterns formed after strong moves.</p>
    <p>After a big upward or downward move, buyers or sellers usually pause to catch their breath before taking the pair further in the same direction.</p>
    <p>Because of this,&nbsp;<strong>the price usually consolidates and forms a tiny symmetrical triangle, which is called a pennant</strong>.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2011/01/pennant.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>While the price is still consolidating, more buyers or sellers usually decide to jump in on the strong move, forcing the price to bust out of the pennant formation.</p>
    <h2>Bearish Pennants</h2>
    <p>A&nbsp;<strong>bearish pennant</strong>&nbsp;is formed during a steep, almost vertical, downtrend.</p>
    <p>After that sharp drop in price, some sellers close their positions while other sellers decide to join the trend, making the price consolidate for a bit.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade7-bearish-pennant-before.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>As soon as enough sellers jump in, the price breaks below the bottom of the pennant and continues to move down.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade7-bearish-pennant-after.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>As you can see, the drop resumed after the price made a breakout to the bottom.</p>
    <p>To trade this chart pattern, we&rsquo;d put a short order at the bottom of the pennant with a stop loss above the pennant.</p>
    <p>That way, we&rsquo;d be out of the trade right away in case the breakdown was a fakeout.</p>
    <p>Unlike the other chart patterns wherein the size of the next move is approximately the height of the formation, pennants signal much stronger moves.</p>
    <p>Usually, the&nbsp;<em>height</em>&nbsp;of the earlier move (also known as the mast) is used to estimate the size of the breakout move.</p>
    <h2>Bullish Pennant</h2>
    <p><strong>Bullish pennants</strong>, just like its name suggests, signals that bulls are about to go a-chargin&rsquo; again.</p>
    <p>This means that the sharp climb in price would resume after that brief period of consolidation when bulls gather enough energy to take the price higher again.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade7-bullish-pennant-before.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>In this example, the price made a sharp vertical climb before taking a breather. I can hear the bulls stomping and revving up for another run!</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade7-bullish-pennant-after.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>Just like we predicted, the price made another strong move upwards after the breakout.</p>
    <p>To play this, we&rsquo;d place our long order above the pennant and our stop below the bottom of the pennant to avoid fakeouts.</p>
    <p>Like we discussed earlier, the size of the breakout move is around the height of the mast (or the size of the earlier move).</p>
    <p>You see, pennants may be small in size but they could signal huge price moves so don&rsquo;t underestimate &rsquo;em!</p>
