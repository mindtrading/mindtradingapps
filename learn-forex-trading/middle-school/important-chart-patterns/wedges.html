    <p>In a Wedge chart pattern, two trend lines converge.</p>
    <p>It means that the magnitude of price movement within the Wedge pattern is decreasing.</p>
    <p>Wedges signal a&nbsp;<strong>pause</strong>&nbsp;in the current trend.</p>
    <p>When you encounter this formation, it signals that forex traders are still deciding where to take the pair next.</p>
    <p>A Falling Wedge is a&nbsp;<strong>bullish</strong>&nbsp;chart pattern that takes place in an upward trend, and the lines slope&nbsp;<em>down</em>.</p>
    <p>A Rising Wedge is a&nbsp;<strong>bearish</strong>&nbsp;chart pattern that&rsquo;s found in a downward trend, and the lines slope&nbsp;<em>up</em>.</p>
    <p>Wedges can serve as either&nbsp;<strong>continuation</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>reversal</strong>&nbsp;patterns.</p>
    <h2>Rising Wedge</h2>
    <p>A&nbsp;<strong>rising wedge</strong>&nbsp;is formed when the price consolidates between upward sloping support and resistance lines.</p>
    <p>Here, the slope of the support line is steeper than that of the resistance.</p>
    <p>This indicates that higher lows are being formed faster than higher highs. This leads to a wedge-like formation, which is exactly where the chart pattern gets its name from!</p>
    <p>With prices consolidating, we know that a big splash is coming, so we can expect a breakout to either the top or bottom.</p>
    <p>If the rising wedge forms after an uptrend, it&rsquo;s usually a bearish reversal pattern.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, if it forms during a downtrend, it could signal a continuation of the down move.</p>
    <p>Either way, the important thing is that, when you spot this forex trading chart pattern, you&rsquo;re ready with your entry orders!</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade7-rising-wedge-reversal-before.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>In this first example, a rising wedge formed at the end of an uptrend.</p>
    <p>Notice how price action is forming<strong>&nbsp;new highs</strong>, but at a much&nbsp;<strong>slower pace</strong>&nbsp;than when price makes higher lows.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade7-rising-wedge-reversal-after.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>See how price broke down to the downside? That means there are more forex traders desperate to be short than be long!</p>
    <p>They pushed the price down to break the trend line, indicating that a downtrend may be in the cards.</p>
    <p>Just like in the other forex trading chart patterns we discussed earlier, the price movement after the breakout is approximately the same magnitude as the height of the formation.</p>
    <p>Now let&rsquo;s take a look at another example of a rising wedge formation. Only this time it acts as a&nbsp;<strong>bearish continuation signal</strong>.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade7-rising-wedge-continuation-before.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>As you can see, the price came from a downtrend before consolidating and sketching higher highs and even higher lows.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade7-rising-wedge-continuation-after.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>In this case, the price broke to the downside and the downtrend continued. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s called a continuation signal yo!</p>
    <p>See how the price made a nice move down that&rsquo;s the same height as the wedge?</p>
    <p>What did we learn so far about these Japanese candlestick chart patterns?</p>
    <p>A rising wedge formed after an uptrend usually leads to a REVERSAL (downtrend) while a rising wedge formed during a downtrend typically results in a CONTINUATION (downtrend).</p>
    <p>Simply put, a rising wedge leads to a downtrend, which means that it&rsquo;s a bearish chart pattern!</p>
    <h2>Falling Wedge</h2>
    <p>Just like the rising wedge, the&nbsp;<strong>falling wedge</strong>&nbsp;can either be a reversal or continuation signal.</p>
    <p>As a reversal signal, it is formed at a bottom of a downtrend, indicating that an uptrend would come next.</p>
    <p>As a continuation signal, it is formed during an uptrend, implying that the upward price action would resume. Unlike the rising wedge, the falling wedge is a bullish chart pattern.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade7-falling-wedge-reversal-before.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>In this example, the falling wedge serves as a reversal signal. After a downtrend, the price made l<strong>ower highs and lower lows</strong>.</p>
    <p>Notice how the falling trend line connecting the highs is steeper than the trend line connecting the lows.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade7-falling-wedge-reversal-after2.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>Upon breaking above the top of the wedge, the pair made a nice move upwards that&rsquo;s approximately equal to the height of the formation. In this case, the price rally went a few more pips beyond that target!</p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at an example where the falling wedge serves as a continuation signal.</p>
    <p>Like we mentioned earlier, when the falling wedge forms during an uptrend, it usually signals that the trend will resume later on.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade7-falling-wedge-continuation-before.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>In this case, the price consolidated for a bit after a strong rally. This could mean that buyers simply paused to catch their breath and probably recruited more people to join the bull camp.</p>
    <p>Hmm, it looks like the pair is revving up for a strong move. Which way would it go?</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade7-falling-wedge-continuation-after.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>See how the price broke to the top side and went on to climb higher?</p>
    <p>If we placed an entry order above that falling trend line connecting the pair&rsquo;s highs, we would&rsquo;ve been able to jump in on the strong uptrend and caught some pips!</p>
    <p>A good upside target would be the height of the wedge formation.</p>
    <p>If you want to go for more pips, you can lock in some profits at the target by closing down a portion of your position, then letting the rest of your position ride.</p>
