    <p>The&nbsp;<strong>head and shoulders chart pattern</strong>&nbsp;is a reversal pattern and most often seen in uptrends.</p>
    <p>Not only is &ldquo;head and shoulders&rdquo; known for trend reversals, but it&rsquo;s also known for dandruff reversals as well.&nbsp;ðŸ˜‚</p>
    <p>In this lesson, we&rsquo;ll stick to talking about trend reversals and leave the topic of dandruff for another time.</p>
    <h2>Head and Shoulders</h2>
    <p>A head and shoulders pattern is also a trend reversal formation.</p>
    <p>It is formed by a&nbsp;<strong>peak</strong>&nbsp;(shoulder), followed by a&nbsp;<strong>higher peak</strong>&nbsp;(head), and then another&nbsp;<strong>lower peak</strong>&nbsp;(shoulder).</p>
    <p>A &ldquo;<strong>neckline</strong>&rdquo; is drawn by connecting the lowest points of the two troughs.</p>
    <p>The slope of this line can either be up or down. Typically, when the slope is down, it produces a more reliable signal.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade7-head-and-shoulders-before.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>In this example, we can easily see the head and shoulders pattern.</p>
    <p>The head is the second peak and is the highest point in the pattern. The two shoulders also form peaks but do not exceed the height of the head.</p>
    <p>With this formation, we put an entry order below the neckline.</p>
    <p>We can also calculate a target by measuring the high point of the head to the neckline.</p>
    <p>This distance is approximately how far the price will move after it breaks the neckline.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade7-head-and-shoulders-after.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>You can see that once the price goes below the neckline it makes a move that is at least the size of the distance between the head and the neckline.</p>
    <p>We know you&rsquo;re thinking to yourself, &ldquo;the price kept moving even after it reached the target.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>And our response is, &ldquo;<strong>DON&rsquo;T BE GREEDY!</strong>&rdquo;</p>
    <h2>Inverse Head and Shoulders</h2>
    <p>The name speaks for itself. It is basically a head and shoulders formation, except this time it&rsquo;s&nbsp;<strong>upside down</strong>.&nbsp;ðŸ™ƒ</p>
    <p>A&nbsp;<strong>valley</strong>&nbsp;is formed (shoulder), followed by an even&nbsp;<strong>lower valley</strong>&nbsp;(head), and then another&nbsp;<strong>higher valley</strong>&nbsp;(shoulder).</p>
    <p>These formations occur after extended downward movements.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade7-inverse-head-and-shoulders-before.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>Here you can see that this is just like a head and shoulders pattern, but it&rsquo;s flipped upside down.</p>
    <p>With this formation, we would place a long entry order above the neckline.</p>
    <p>Our target is calculated just like the head and shoulders pattern.</p>
    <p>Measure the<strong>&nbsp;distance between the head and the neckline</strong>, and that is approximately the distance that the price will move after it breaks the neckline.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade7-inverse-head-and-shoulders-after.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>You can see that the price moved up nicely after it broke the neckline.</p>
    <p>If your target is hit, then be happy with your profits.</p>
    <p>However, there are trade management techniques where you can lock in some of your profits and still keep your trade open in case the price continues to move your way.</p>
    <p>You will learn about those later on in the course.</p>
