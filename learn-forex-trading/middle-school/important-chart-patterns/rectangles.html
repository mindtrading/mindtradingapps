    <p>A&nbsp;<strong>rectangle</strong>&nbsp;is a chart pattern formed when the price is bounded by parallel support and resistance levels.</p>
    <p>A rectangle exhibits a period of&nbsp;<strong>consolidation</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>indecision</strong>&nbsp;between buyers and sellers as they take turns throwing punches but neither has dominated.</p>
    <p>The price will &ldquo;test&rdquo; the support and resistance levels several times before eventually breaking out.</p>
    <p>From there, the price could trend in the direction of the breakout, whether it is to the upside or downside.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade7-rectangle.png"  /></p>
    <p>In the example above, we can clearly see that the pair was bounded by two key price levels which are parallel to one another.</p>
    <p>We just have to wait until one of these levels breaks and go along for the ride!</p>
    <p>Remember, when you spot a rectangle:&nbsp;<strong>THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX!</strong></p>
    <h2>Bearish Rectangle</h2>
    <p>A&nbsp;<strong>bearish rectangle</strong>&nbsp;is formed when the price consolidates for a while during a downtrend.</p>
    <p>This happens because sellers probably need to pause and catch their breath before taking the pair any lower.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade7-bearish-rectangle-before.png" /></p>
    <p>In this example, price broke the bottom of the rectangle chart pattern and continued to shoot down.</p>
    <p>If we had a short order just below the support level, we would have made a nice profit on this trade.</p>

    <p><strong>Here&rsquo;s a tip:</strong>&nbsp;Once the pair falls below the support, it tends to make a move that is about the size of the rectangle pattern.</p>
    <p>In the example above, the pair moved beyond the target so there would have been a chance to catch more pips!</p>
    <h2>Bullish Rectangle</h2>
    <p>Here&rsquo;s another example of a rectangle, this time, a&nbsp;<strong>bullish rectangle&nbsp;</strong>chart pattern.</p>
    <p>After an uptrend, the price paused to consolidate for a bit. Can you guess where the price is headed next?</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade7-bullish-rectangle-before.png" /></p>
    <p>If you answered up, then you&rsquo;re right! Check out that nice upside breakout right there!</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade7-bullish-rectangle-after.png" /></p>
    <p>Notice how the price moved all the way up after breaking above the top of the rectangle pattern.</p>
    <p>If we had a long order on top of the resistance level, we would&rsquo;ve caught some pips on the trade!</p>
    <p>Just like in the bearish rectangle pattern example, once the pair breaks, it will usually make a move that&rsquo;s AT LEAST the size of its previous range.</p>
