    <p>By now you have an arsenal of weapons to use when you battle the market.</p>
    <p>In this lesson, you will add yet another weapon:&nbsp;<strong>CHART PATTERNS!</strong></p>
    <p>Think of chart patterns as a land mine detector because, once you finish this lesson, you will be able to spot &ldquo;explosions&rdquo; on the charts before they even happen, potentially making you a lot of money in the process.</p>
    <p>Chart patterns are like that funny feeling you get in your tummy right before you let a fart explode.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade7-fart-out.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p><em>Don&rsquo;t you wish you had a chart to detect this explosion?</em></p>
    <p>In this lesson, you will learn&nbsp;<strong>classic chart patterns and formations.</strong></p>
    <p>When correctly identified, it usually leads to an explosive breakout, so watch out!</p>
    <p>Remember, our goal is to spot big movements before they happen so that we can ride them out and rake in the cash.</p>
    <p>After all, who doesn&rsquo;t want to have a pool of cash to swim in like Richie Rich?</p>
    <p>Chart formations will greatly help us spot conditions where the price is ready to break out in a certain direction.</p>
    <p>They can also indicate whether the price will continue in its current direction or reverse so we&rsquo;ll also be devising some nifty trade strategies for these chart patterns.</p>
    <p>In a nutshell, chart patterns help you answer three questions:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>How do I find potential entry points in a rising (or falling) trend?</li>
    <li>How can chart patterns offer potential entry signals?</li>
    <li>How do I know when to get out (exit signal) either to take profit (if the chart pattern worked) or cut my losses (if the chart pattern failed)?</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Don&rsquo;t worry, we&rsquo;ll give you a neat little cheat sheet to help you remember all these cool patterns and strategies!</p>
    <p>Here&rsquo;s the list of&nbsp;<strong>chart patterns</strong>&nbsp;that we&rsquo;re going to cover:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Double Top and Double Bottom</li>
    <li>Head and Shoulders and Inverse Head and Shoulders</li>
    <li>Rising and Falling Wedges</li>
    <li>Bullish and Bearish Rectangles</li>
    <li>Bearish and Bullish Pennants</li>
    <li>Triangles (Symmetrical, Ascending, and Descending)</li>
    </ul>
