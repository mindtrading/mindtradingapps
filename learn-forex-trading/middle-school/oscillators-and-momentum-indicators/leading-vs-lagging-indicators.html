    <p>We&rsquo;ve already covered a lot of tools that can help you analyze potential trending and range-bound trade opportunities.</p>
    <p>Still doing great so far? Awesome! Let&rsquo;s move on. Welcome to Grade 6!</p>
    <p>In this lesson, we&rsquo;re going to streamline your use of these chart indicators.</p>
    <p>We want you to fully understand the strengths and weaknesses of each tool, so you&rsquo;ll be able to determine which ones work for you and which ones don&rsquo;t.</p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s discuss some concepts first. There are two types of indicators:&nbsp;<strong>leading</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>lagging</strong>.</p>
    <p>A&nbsp;<strong>leading</strong>&nbsp;indicator gives a signal&nbsp;<strong>before</strong>&nbsp;the new trend or reversal occurs.</p>
    <p>These indicators help you profit by predicting what prices will do next.</p>
    <p>Leading indicators typically work by measuring how &ldquo;overbought&rdquo; or &ldquo;oversold&rdquo; something is.</p>
    <p>This is done with the assumption that if a currency pair is &ldquo;oversold&rdquo;, it will bounce back.</p>
    <p><img title="Leading Indicator" src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2011/01/leading-indicator.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>A&nbsp;<strong>lagging</strong>&nbsp;indicator gives a signal&nbsp;<strong>after</strong>&nbsp;the trend has started and basically informs you &ldquo;Hey buddy, pay attention, the trend has started and you&rsquo;re missing the boat.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Lagging indicators work well when prices move in relatively long trends.</p>
    <p>They don&rsquo;t warn you of any upcoming changes in prices though, they simply tell you&nbsp;<strong>what prices are doing</strong>&nbsp;(rising or falling) so that you can trade accordingly.</p>
    <p>You&rsquo;re probably thinking, &ldquo;Ooooh, I&rsquo;m going to get rich with leading indicators!&rdquo; since you would be able to profit from a new trend right at the start.</p>
    <p>You&rsquo;re right.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade6-trend-detective.png" alt="" />You would &ldquo;catch&rdquo; the entire trend every single time IF the leading indicator was correct every single time. But it won&rsquo;t be.</p>
    <p>When you use leading indicators, you will experience a lot of&nbsp;<strong>fakeouts</strong>. Leading indicators are notorious for giving bogus signals which could &ldquo;mislead&rdquo; you.</p>
    <p>Get it? Leading indicators that &ldquo;mislead&rdquo; you?</p>
    <p>Haha. Man, we&rsquo;re so funny we even crack ourselves up.</p>
    <p>The other option is to use lagging indicators, which aren&rsquo;t as prone to bogus signals.</p>
    <p>Lagging indicators only give signals after the price change is clearly forming a trend. The downside is that you&rsquo;d be a little late in entering a position.</p>
    <p>Often the biggest gains of a trend occur in the first few bars, so by using a lagging indicator you could potentially miss out on much of the profit. And that sucks.</p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s kinda like wearing bell-bottoms in the 1980s and thinking you&rsquo;re so cool and hip with fashion&hellip;</p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s kinda like discovering Facebook for the first time when all your friends are already on TikTok&hellip;</p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s kinda like getting excited buying a new flip phone that now takes photos when the iPhone 11 Pro came out&hellip;</p>
    <p>Lagging indicators have you buy and sell late. But in exchange for missing any early opportunities, they greatly&nbsp;<strong>reduce your risk by keeping you on the right side of the market</strong>.</p>
    <p>For the purpose of this lesson, let&rsquo;s broadly categorize all of our technical indicators into one of two categories:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Leading indicators or oscillators</li>
    <li>Lagging or trend-following indicators</li>
    </ol>
    <p>While the two can be supportive of each other, they&rsquo;re more likely to&nbsp;<strong>conflict with each other</strong>.</p>
    <p>Lagging indicators don&rsquo;t work well in sideways markets.</p>
    <p>Do you know what does though? Leading indicators!</p>
    <p>Yup, leading indicators perform best in sideways, &ldquo;ranging&rdquo; markets.</p>
    <p>The general approach is that&nbsp;<strong>you should use lagging indicators during trending markets and leading indicators during sideways markets.</strong></p>
    <p>We&rsquo;re not saying that one or the other should be used exclusively, but you must understand the potential pitfalls of each.</p>
