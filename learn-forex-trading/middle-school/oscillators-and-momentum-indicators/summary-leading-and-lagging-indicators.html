    <p>Many forex traders use technical indicators as part of their technical analysis toolbox.</p>
    <p>We&rsquo;ve gone through the two types of technical indicators based on the timing of the signals they provide.</p>
    <p>Here&rsquo;s a quick recap of what we discussed in the previous lessons:</p>
    <p>There are two types of indicators:&nbsp;<strong>leading</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>lagging</strong>.</p>
    <ol>
    <li>A&nbsp;<strong>leading</strong>&nbsp;indicator or an oscillator gives a signal&nbsp;<strong>before</strong>&nbsp;the new trend or reversal occurs.</li>
    <li>A&nbsp;<strong>lagging</strong>&nbsp;indicator or trend-following indicator gives a signal&nbsp;<strong>after</strong>&nbsp;the trend has started.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Leading Indicators</h2>
    <p>Leading indicators are typically oscillators.</p>
    <p>They are considered leading because these indicators give you a signal&nbsp;<em>before</em>&nbsp;the potential trend reversal actually occurs.</p>
    <p>An advantage of leading indicators is that they can put you into a potential reversal early.</p>
    <p>A disadvantage is that oscillators provide many false signals.</p>
    <p>Leading indicators don&rsquo;t make good standalone tools. You should&nbsp;<em>combine</em>&nbsp;leading indicators with other tools such as Japanese candlestick patterns classic chart patterns, and support and resistance.</p>
    <p>If you&rsquo;re able to identify the type of market you are trading in, you can pinpoint which indicators could provide helpful signals and which ones are worthless and to ignore.</p>
    <p>Popular leading indicators are the Stochastic, the Relative Strength Index (RSI), Williams %R, and the Momentum indicator.</p>
    <h2>Lagging Indicators</h2>
    <p>Lagging indicators are also known as&nbsp;<strong>trend-following</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>trend-confirming indicators</strong>.</p>
    <p>Trading signals of the lagging indicators come&nbsp;<em>after</em>&nbsp;the event has occurred on the chart.</p>
    <p>A disadvantage of lagging indicators is that they put you in the trade fairly late. This means that you will typically miss a relatively big part of the price move.</p>
    <p>Popular lagging indicators are Moving Averages (Simple, Exponential, Weighted), Parabolic SAR, and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD).</p>
    <p>So, how do you figure out when to use oscillators or trend-following indicators, or both?</p>
    <p>That&rsquo;s another million-dollar question! After all, we know they don&rsquo;t always work in tandem.</p>
    <p>We&rsquo;ll give you a million dollars really soon&hellip;</p>
    <p>Oh wait! We meant the million-dollar answer!</p>
    <p>For now, just know that once you&rsquo;re able to identify the type of market you are trading in, you will then know which indicators will give accurate signals, and which ones are worthless at that time.</p>
    <p>This is no piece of cake.</p>
    <p>But it&rsquo;s a skill you will slowly improve upon as your experience grows.</p>
    <p>Besides&hellip;</p>
    <p>You&rsquo;re not at it alone!</p>
    <p>In the future sections, we&rsquo;re going to teach you how to correctly identify the forex market environment you are trading into better use these indicators!</p>
