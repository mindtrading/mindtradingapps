    <p>An&nbsp;<strong>oscillator</strong>&nbsp;is any object or data that moves back and forth between two points.</p>
    <p>In other words, it&rsquo;s an item that is going to always fall somewhere between point A and point B.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2011/01/oscillator.png" s /></p>
    <p>Think of when you hit the oscillating switch on your electric fan.</p>
    <p>Think of our technical indicators as either being &ldquo;on&rdquo; or &ldquo;off&rdquo;.</p>
    <p>More specifically, an oscillator will usually signal &ldquo;<strong>buy</strong>&rdquo; or &ldquo;<strong>sell</strong>&rdquo; with the only exception being instances when the oscillator is not clear at either end of the buy/sell range.</p>
    <p>Does this sound familiar? It should!</p>
    <p>The Williams %R, Stochastic, and Relative Strength Index (RSI) are all oscillators.</p>
    <p><strong>Oscillators work under the premise that as&nbsp;<em>momentum begins to slow</em>, fewer buyers (if in an uptrend) or fewer sellers (if in a downtrend) are willing to trade at the current price.</strong></p>
    <p>A change in momentum is often a signal that the&nbsp;<strong>current trend is weakening</strong>.</p>
    <p>Each of these indicators is designed to signal a possible&nbsp;<strong>trend reversal,</strong>&nbsp;where the previous trend has run its course and the price is ready to&nbsp;<strong>change direction</strong>.</p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at a couple of examples.</p>
    <p>We&rsquo;ve slapped on all three oscillators on GBP/USD&rsquo;s daily chart shown below.</p>
    <p>Remember when we discussed how to work the Stochastic, Parabolic SAR, and RSI?</p>
    <p>If you don&rsquo;t, we&rsquo;re sending you back to fifth grade!</p>
    <p>Anyway, as you can see on the chart, all three indicators gave buy signals towards the end of December.</p>
    <p>Taking that trade would&rsquo;ve yielded around 400 pips in gains. Ka-ching!</p>
    <p><img  src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade6-leading-indicators-right.png"  /></p>
    <p>Then, during the third week of January, the Stochastic, Parabolic SAR, and RSI all gave sell signals.</p>
    <p>And judging from that long 3-month drop afterward, you would&rsquo;ve made a whole lot of pips if you took that short trade.</p>
    <p>Around mid-April, all three oscillators gave another sell signal, after which the price made another sharp dive.</p>
    <p>Now let&rsquo;s take a look at the same oscillators messing up, just so you know these signals aren&rsquo;t perfect.</p>
    <p>In the chart below, you can see that the indicators could give conflicting signals.</p>
    <p>For instance, the Parabolic SAR gave a sell signal in mid-February while the Stochastic showed the exact opposite signal.</p>
    <p>Which one should you follow?</p>
    <p>Well, the RSI seems to be just as undecided as you are since it didn&rsquo;t give any buy or sell signals at that time.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade6-leading-indicators-wrong4.png"  /></p>
    <p>Looking at the chart above, you can quickly see that there were a lot of false signals popping up.</p>
    <p>During the second week of April, both the Stochastic and the RSI gave sell signals while the Parabolic SAR didn&rsquo;t give one.</p>
    <p>The price kept climbing from there and you could&rsquo;ve lost a bunch of pips if you entered a short trade right away.</p>
    <p>You would&rsquo;ve had another loss around the middle of May if you acted on those buy signals from the Stochastic and RSI and simply ignored the sell signal from the Parabolic SAR.</p>
    <p>What happened to such a good set of indicators?</p>
    <p>The answer lies in the method of calculation for each one.</p>
    <p><strong>Stochastic</strong>&nbsp;is based on the high-to-low range of the time period (in this case, it&rsquo;s hourly), yet it doesn&rsquo;t account for changes from one hour to the next.</p>
    <p>The&nbsp;<strong>Relative Strength Index (RSI)</strong>&nbsp;uses the change from one closing price to the next.</p>
    <p><strong>Parabolic SAR</strong>&nbsp;has its own unique calculations that can further cause conflict.</p>
    <p>That&rsquo;s the nature of oscillators. They assume that a particular price movement always results in the same reversal.</p>
    <p>Of course,&nbsp;<strong>that&rsquo;s hogwash</strong>.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2011/01/17181013/hogwash.png"  /></p>
    <p>While being aware of why a leading indicator may be wrong, there&rsquo;s no way to avoid them.</p>
    <p>If you&rsquo;re getting mixed signals, you&rsquo;re better off doing nothing than taking a &ldquo;best guess&rdquo;. If a chart doesn&rsquo;t meet all your criteria, don&rsquo;t force the trade!</p>
    <p>Move on to the next one that does meet your criteria.</p>
