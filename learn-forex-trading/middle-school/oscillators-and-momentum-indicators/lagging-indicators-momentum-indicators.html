    <p>The&nbsp;indicators&nbsp;that can do so have already been identified as&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>moving averages</strong>.</p>
    <p>These indicators will spot trends once they have been established, at the expense of delayed entry.</p>
    <p>The bright side is that there&rsquo;s less chance of being wrong.</p>

    <p>On GBP/USD&rsquo;s daily chart above, we&rsquo;ve put on the 10 EMA (blue), 20 EMA (red), and the MACD.</p>
    <p>Around October 15, the 10 EMA crossed above the 20 EMA, which is a&nbsp;<strong>bullish crossover</strong>.</p>
    <p>Similarly, the MACD made an upward crossover and gave a buy signal.</p>
    <p>If you jumped in on a long trade back then, you would&rsquo;ve enjoyed that nice uptrend that followed.</p>
    <p>Later on, both the moving averages and MACD gave a couple of sell signals.</p>
    <p>And judging from the strong downtrends that occurred, taking those short trades would&rsquo;ve given huge profits.</p>
    <p>We can see those dollar signs flashing in your eyes!</p>
    <p>Now let&rsquo;s look at another chart so you can see how these crossover signals can sometimes give false signals.</p>
    <p>We like to call them &ldquo;<strong>fakeouts</strong>.&rdquo;</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade6-momentum-indicators-wrong.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>On March 15, the MACD made a bullish crossover while the moving averages gave no signal whatsoever.</p>
    <p>If you acted on that buy signal from the MACD, you just suffered a fakeout, buddy.</p>
    <p>Similarly, the MACD&rsquo;s buy signal by the end of May wasn&rsquo;t accompanied by any moving average crossover.</p>
    <p>If you entered a long trade right then and there, you might&rsquo;ve set yourself up for a loss since the price dipped a bit after that.</p>
