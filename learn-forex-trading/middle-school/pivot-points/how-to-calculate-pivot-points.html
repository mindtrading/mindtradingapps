    <p>The first thing you&rsquo;re going to learn is how to calculate pivot point levels.</p>
    <p>The pivot point and associated support and resistance levels are calculated by using the last trading session&rsquo;s open, high, low, and close.</p>
    <p>Since forex is a 24-hour market, most forex traders use the New York closing time of 5:00 pm EST as the previous day&rsquo;s close.</p>
    <h2>Pivot Point Calculation</h2>
    <p>The calculation for a pivot point is shown below:</p>
    <p><strong>Pivot point (PP)</strong>&nbsp;= (High + Low + Close) / 3</p>
    <p>Support and resistance levels are then calculated off the pivot point like so:</p>
    <p>First level support and resistance:</p>
    <p><strong>First resistance (R1)</strong>&nbsp;= (2 x PP) &ndash; Low</p>
    <p><strong>First support (S1)</strong>&nbsp;= (2 x PP) &ndash; High</p>
    <p>Second level of support and resistance:</p>
    <p><strong>Second resistance (R2)</strong>&nbsp;= PP + (High &ndash; Low)</p>
    <p><strong>Second support (S2)</strong>&nbsp;= PP &ndash; (High &ndash; Low)</p>
    <p>Third level of support and resistance:</p>
    <p><strong>Third resistance (R3)&nbsp;</strong>= High + 2(PP &ndash; Low)</p>
    <p><strong>Third support (S3)</strong>&nbsp;= Low &ndash; 2(High &ndash; PP)</p>
    <p>Keep in mind that some forex charting software plots intermediate levels or mid-point levels.</p>
    <p>These are basically&nbsp;<em>mini levels</em>&nbsp;between the main pivot point and support and resistance levels.</p>

    <p>If you hated algebra, have no fear because you don&rsquo;t have to perform these calculations yourself.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Most charting software will automatically do this for you. Just make sure you configure your settings so that it uses the correct closing time and price.</p>
    <p>We here at BabyPips.com also have our very own Pivot Point Calculator!</p>
    <p>The forex pivot point calculator can come in handy, especially if you want to do a little backtesting to see how pivot point levels have held up in the past.</p>
    <p>Remember, one of the advantages of using pivot points is that it is objective, so it&rsquo;s very easy to test how prices react to them.</p>
    <p>Next up, we&rsquo;ll teach you the various ways in which you can incorporate pivot points into your forex trading strategy.</p>
