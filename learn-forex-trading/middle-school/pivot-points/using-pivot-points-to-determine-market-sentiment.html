    <p>There is one other way to incorporate pivot points into your forex trading strategy, and that&rsquo;s to use it to gauge&nbsp;<strong>market sentiment</strong>.</p>
    <p>What this means is that you can tell whether traders are more inclined to buy or sell the currency pair.</p>
    <p>All you would need to do is to keep an eye on the pivot point. You could treat it like the 50-yard line of an American football field.</p>
    <p>Depending on which side the ball (in this case, price) is on, you can tell whether buyers or sellers have the upper hand.</p>
    <p>If the price breaks through the pivot point to the top, it&rsquo;s a sign that traders are bullish on the pair and you should start buying the pair like it&rsquo;s a Krispy Kreme donut.</p>
    <p>Here&rsquo;s an example of what happened when the price stayed above the pivot point.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade8-pivot-points-bullish.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>In this example, we see that EUR/USD gapped up and opened above the pivot point.</p>
    <p>The price then rose higher and higher, breaking through all the resistance levels.</p>
    <p>Now, if the price breaks through the pivot point to the bottom, then you should start selling the currency pair like it&rsquo;s Enron&nbsp;or Theranos stock.</p>
    <p>The price being below the pivot point would signal bearish sentiment and that sellers could have the upper hand for the trading session.</p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at a chart of&nbsp;<strong>GBP/USD</strong>.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade8-pivot-points-bearish.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>In the chart above, we see that the price tested the pivot point, which held as a&nbsp;<strong>resistance level</strong>. Next thing you know, the pair keeps going lower and lower.</p>
    <p>If you had taken the clue that price remained below the pivot point and sold the pair, you would have made some nice moolah. GBP/USD dropped&nbsp;almost 300 pips!</p>
    <p>Of course, it doesn&rsquo;t always work out like this.</p>
    <p><strong>There are times when you think that forex traders are bearish on a pair, only to see that the pair reverses and breaks through to the top!</strong></p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade8-pivot-points-undecided.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>In this example, if you saw price breaking lower from the pivot point and sold, you would have had a sad, sad day.</p>
    <p>Later on, during the European session, EUR/USD popped higher, eventually breaking through the pivot point. What&rsquo;s more, the pair stayed above the pivot point, showing how buyers were rockin&rsquo; away.</p>
    <p>The lesson here?</p>
    <p>Traders are fickle!</p>
    <p>How forex traders feel about a currency can shift dramatically day to day, even session to session.</p>
    <p>This is why you cannot simply buy when the price is above the pivot point or sell when it is below it.</p>
    <p>Instead, if you choose to use pivot point analysis in this way, you should combine it with other indicators to help you determine overall market sentiment.</p>
