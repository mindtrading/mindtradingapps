    <p>Let&rsquo;s say you want to buy EUR/GBP and your broker account is denominated in USD.</p>
    <p>In this trade, you only want to risk USD $100. But you&rsquo;re not trading US dollars, you are trading euros and pounds. How do you calculate your position size?</p>
    <p>In this lesson, we&rsquo;ll teach you how to determine your position size if you are trading currency pairs that aren&rsquo;t in your account denomination.</p>

    <h2>If your account denomination is not in the currency pair traded, but the same as the conversion pair&rsquo;s counter currency&hellip;</h2>
    <h3>Example: USD account trading EUR/GBP</h3>
    <p>Ned, who we introduced in the previous lesson, is back in the U.S. Today, he decides to trade EUR/GBP with a 200 pip stop.</p>
    <p>To find the correct position size, we need to find the value of Ned&rsquo;s risk in British Pounds.</p>
    <p>Remember,&nbsp;<strong>the value of a currency pair is in the counter currency.</strong></p>
    <h3>Step 1: Determine risk amount in USD</h3>
    <p>Okay, let&rsquo;s straighten things out here. He&rsquo;s back trading with his U.S. broker selling EUR/GBP and he only wants to risk&nbsp;<strong>1% of his USD 5,000 account, or USD 50</strong>.</p>
    <p>To find the correct forex position size in this situation, we need the GBP/USD exchange rate.</p>
    <h3>Step 2:&nbsp;Convert USD risk amount to GBP</h3>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s use 1.7500 and because his account is in USD, we need to invert that exchange rate to find the proper amount in British Pounds.</p>
    <p>USD 50 * (GBP 1/USD 1.7500) =&nbsp;<strong>GBP 28.57</strong></p>
    <p>Now, we just finish the rest the same way as the other examples.</p>
    <h3>Step 3:&nbsp;Convert GBP risk amount to&nbsp;pips</h3>
    <p>Divide by the stop loss in pips:</p>
    <p>(GBP 28.57)/(200 pips) =&nbsp;<strong>GBP 0.14 per pip</strong></p>
    <h3>Step 4:&nbsp;Calculate for position size</h3>
    <p>And finally, multiply by the known unit-to-pip value ratio:</p>
    <p>(GBP 0.14 per pip) * [(10k units of EUR/GBP)/(GBP 1 per pip)] = approximately 1,429 units of EUR/GBP</p>
    <p>Ned can sell no more than&nbsp;<strong>1,429 units</strong>&nbsp;of EUR/GBP to stay within his pre-determined risk levels.</p>
    <h2>If your account denomination is not in the currency pair traded, but the same as the conversion pair&rsquo;s base currency&hellip;</h2>
    <h3>Example: CHF account trading USD/JPY</h3>
    <p>Ned decides to go snowboarding in Switzerland, and in between a couple of double black diamond runs, he opens up his trading account on his super spy phone with a local forex&nbsp;broker.</p>
    <p>He sees a great setup on USD/JPY, and he has decided that he will get out of the trade if it goes beyond a major resistance level&ndash;about 100 pips against him.</p>
    <h3>Step 1: Determine risk amount in&nbsp;CHF</h3>
    <p>Ned will only risk the usual&nbsp;<strong>1% of his CHF 5,000 account or CHF 50</strong>.</p>
    <h3>Step 2:&nbsp;Convert CHF risk amount to&nbsp;JPY</h3>
    <p>First, we need to find the value of CHF 50 in Japanese yen, and since the account is the same denomination as the conversion pair&rsquo;s base currency, all we have to do is multiply the amount risked by CHF/JPY exchange rate (85.00):</p>
    <p>CHF 50 * (JPY 85.00/ CHF 1) =&nbsp;<strong>JPY 4,250</strong></p>
    <p>Now, we just finish the rest the same way as the other examples.</p>
    <h3>Step 3:&nbsp;Convert JPY risk amount to&nbsp;pips</h3>
    <p>Divide by the stop loss in pips:</p>
    <p>JPY 4,250/100 pips =&nbsp;<strong>JPY 42.50 per pip</strong></p>
    <h3>Step 4:&nbsp;Calculate for position size</h3>
    <p>And finally, multiply by a known unit-to-pip value ratio:</p>
    <p>JPY 42.50 per pip * [(100 units of USD/JPY)/(JPY 1 per pip)] = approximately 4,250 units of USD/JPY</p>
    <p>Shabam! There you have it!</p>
    <p>Ned can trade no more than&nbsp;<strong>4,250 units of USD/JPY</strong>&nbsp;to keep his loss at CHF 50 or less.</p>
