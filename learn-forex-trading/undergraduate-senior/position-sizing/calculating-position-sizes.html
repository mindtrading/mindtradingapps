    <p>To make things easier for you to understand, as usual, we&rsquo;ll be explaining everything with an example.</p>
    <p><strong>This is Newbie Ned.</strong></p>
    <p><img title="Calculating Forex Position Sizes" src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/senior-newbie-ned.jpg"  /></p>
    <p>A long time ago, back when he was even more of a newbie than he is now, he blew out his account because he put on some enormous positions.</p>
    <p>It was as if he was a gun-slinging cowboy from the Midwest &ndash; he traded from the hip and traded BIG.</p>
    <p>Ned didn&rsquo;t fully understand the importance of position sizing and his account paid dearly for it.</p>
    <p>He re-enrolled into the School of Pipsology to make&nbsp;sure that he understands it fully this time, and to make sure what happened to him never happens to you!</p>
    <p>In the following examples, we&rsquo;ll show you how to calculate your position size based on your account size and risk comfort level.</p>
    <p>Your position size will also depend on whether or not your account denomination is the same as the base or quote currency.</p>
    <h2>If your account denomination is the same as the counter currency&hellip;</h2>
    <p>Newbie Ned just deposited USD 5,000 into his trading account and he is ready to start trading again. Let&rsquo;s say he now uses a&nbsp;swing trading&nbsp;system that trades EUR/USD and that he risks about 200 pips per trade.</p>
    <p>Ever since he blew out his first account, he has now sworn that he doesn&rsquo;t want to risk more than 1% of his account per trade.</p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s figure how big his position size needs to be to stay within his risk comfort zone.</p>
    <p>Using his account balance and the percentage amount he wants to risk, we can calculate the dollar amount risked.</p>
    <p>USD 5,000 x 1% (or 0.01) = USD 50</p>
    <p>Next, we divide the amount risked by the stop to find the value per pip.</p>
    <p>(USD 50)/(200 pips) = USD 0.25/pip</p>
    <p>Lastly, we multiply the value per pip by a known unit/pip value ratio of EUR/USD. In this case, with 10k units (or one mini lot), each pip move is worth USD 1.</p>
    <p>USD 0.25 per pip * [(10k units of EUR/USD)/(USD 1 per pip)] = 2,500 units of EUR/USD</p>
    <p>So, Newbie Ned should put on 2,500 units of EUR/USD or less to stay within his risk&nbsp;comfort level with his current trade setup. Otherwise, he&rsquo;d be regressing back to his previous gambling self.</p>
    <p>Pretty simple eh?</p>
    <p>But what if your account is the same as the base currency?</p>
    <h2>If your account denomination is the same as the base currency&hellip;</h2>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s say Ned is now chilling in the eurozone, decides to trade forex with a local broker, and deposits EUR 5,000.</p>
    <p>Using the same trade example as before (trading EUR/USD with a 200 pip stop) what would his position size be if he only risked 1% of his account?</p>
    <p>EUR 5,000 * 1% (or 0.01) = EUR 50</p>
    <p>Now we have to convert this to USD because the value of a currency pair is calculated by the counter currency. Let&rsquo;s say the current exchange rate for 1 EUR is $1.5000 (EUR/USD = 1.5000).</p>
    <p>All we have to do to find the value in USD is invert the current exchange rate for EUR/USD and multiply by the amount of euros we wish to risk.</p>
    <p>(USD 1.5000/EUR 1.0000) * EUR 50 = approx. USD 75.00</p>
    <p>Next, divide your risk in USD by your stop loss in pips:</p>
    <p>(USD 75.00)/(200 pips) = $0.375 a pip move.</p>
    <p>This gives Ned the &ldquo;value per pip&rdquo; move with a 200 pip stop to stay within his risk comfort level.</p>
    <p>Finally, multiply the value per pip move by the known unit-to-pip value ratio:</p>
    <p>(USD 0.375 per pip) * [(10k units of EUR/USD)/(USD1 per pip)] = 3,750 units of EUR/USD</p>
    <p>So, to risk EUR 50 or less on a 200 pip stop on EUR/USD, Ned&rsquo;s position size can be no bigger than 3,750 units.</p>
    <p>Still pretty simple, eh?</p>
    <p>Well, now it gets slightly more complicated.</p>
    <p>Don&rsquo;t worry though. We got yo back and we&rsquo;ll explain everything so it&rsquo;ll become as easy as baking a cake.</p>
