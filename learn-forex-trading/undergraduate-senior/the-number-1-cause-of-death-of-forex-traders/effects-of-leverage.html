    <p>Hopefully, you now have a better understanding of what &ldquo;margin&rdquo; is.</p>
    <p>If you don&rsquo;t know what margin is, or think it&rsquo;s an alternative form of butter, please read our previous lessons.</p>
    <p>Now we want to take a harder look at &ldquo;leverage&rdquo; and show you how it regularly wipes out unsuspecting or overzealous traders.</p>
    <p>Before we begin, let the image below haunt you about the negative effects of using too much leverage and running out of margin.</p>
    <p><img title="Leverage Overdose" src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/senior-leverage-overdose.png" /></p>
    <p>We&rsquo;ve all seen or heard online forex brokers advertising how they offer 200:1 leverage or 400:1 leverage.</p>
    <p>We just want to be clear that what they are really talking about is the maximum leverage you can trade with.</p>
    <p>Remember this leverage ratio depends on the margin required by the broker. For example, if a 1% margin is required, you have 100:1 leverage.</p>
    <p>There is maximum leverage. And then there is your true leverage.</p>
    <h2>True Leverage</h2>
    <p><strong>True leverage</strong>&nbsp;is the &ldquo;full value&rdquo;, also known as &ldquo;notional value&rdquo;, of your position divided by the amount of money deposited in your trading account.</p>
    <p>Huh?</p>
    <p>Let us illustrate with an example:</p>
    <p>You deposit $10,000 in your trading account. You buy 1 standard 100K of EUR/USD at a rate of $1.0000. The full value of your position is&nbsp;<strong>$100,000</strong>&nbsp;and your account balance is<strong>&nbsp;$10,000</strong>.</p>
    <p><strong>Your true leverage is 10:1</strong>&nbsp;($100,000 / $10,000)</p>
    <p>&ldquo;True leverage&rdquo; is also known as &ldquo;<strong>effective leverage</strong>&ldquo;.</p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s say you buy another standard lot of EUR/USD at the same price. The full amount of your position is now $200,000, but your account balance is still $10,000.</p>
    <p><strong>Your true leverage is now 20:1</strong>&nbsp;($200,000 / $10,000)</p>
    <p>You&rsquo;re feeling good so you buy three more standard lots of EUR/USD, again at the same rate. The full amount of your position is now $500,000 and your account balance is still $10,000.</p>
    <p><strong>Your true leverage is now 50:1</strong>&nbsp;($500,000 / $10,000).</p>
    <p>Assume the broker requires a 1% margin.</p>
    <p>If you do the math, your account balance and equity are both $10,000, the Used Margin is $5,000, and the Usable Margin is $5,000. For one standard lot, each pip is worth $10.</p>
    <p><img title="10,000 USD Balance, 10,000 USD Equity, 5,000 USD Used Margin, 9,900 USD Usable Margin" src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/senior-usable-margin-6.png" /></p>
    <p>In order to receive a margin call, the price would have to move<strong>&nbsp;100 pips</strong>&nbsp;($5,000 Usable Margin divided by $50/pip).</p>
    <p>This would mean the price of EUR/USD would have to move from 1.0000 to .9900 &ndash; a price change of&nbsp;<strong>1%</strong>.</p>
    <p>After the margin call, your account balance would be $5,000.</p>
    <p><strong>You lost $5,000 or 50% of your account and the price only moved 1%. Das cray.</strong></p>
    <p>Now let&rsquo;s pretend you ordered coffee at a McDonald&rsquo;s drive-thru, then spilled your coffee on your lap while you were driving, and then proceeded to sue and win against McDonald&rsquo;s because your legs got burned and you didn&rsquo;t know the coffee was hot.</p>
    <p>To make a long story short, you deposit $100,000 in your trading account instead of $10,000.</p>
    <p>You buy just 1 standard lot of EUR/USD &ndash; at a rate of 1.0000. The full amount of your position is $100,000 and your account balance is $100,000. Your true leverage is&nbsp;<strong>1:1.</strong></p>
    <p>Here&rsquo;s how it looks in your trading account:</p>
    <p><img title="100,000 USD Balance, 100,000 USD Equity, 1,000 USD Used Margin, 99,000 USD Usable Margin" src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/senior-usable-margin-7.png" /></p>
    <p>In this example, in order to receive a margin call, the price would have to move<strong>&nbsp;9,900 pips</strong>&nbsp;($99,000 Usable Margin divided by $10/pip).</p>
    <p>This means the price of EUR/USD would have to move from 1.0000 to .0100! This is a price change of 99% or basically 100%!</p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s say you buy 19 more standard lots, again at the same rate as the first trade.</p>
    <p>The full amount of your position is $2,000,000 and your account balance is $100,000. Your true leverage is 20:1.</p>
    <p><img title="100,000 USD Balance, 100,000 USD Equity, 20,000 USD Used Margin, 80,000 USD Usable Margin" src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/senior-usable-margin-8.png" /></p>
    <p>In order to be &ldquo;margin called&rdquo;, the price would have to move 400 pips ($80,000 Usable Margin divided by ($10/pip X 20 lots)).</p>
    <p>That means the price of EUR/USD would have to move from $1.0000 to $0.9600 &ndash; a price change of 4%.</p>
    <p>If you did get margin called and your trade exited at the margin call price, this is how your account would look like:</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/senior-usable-margin-9.png" /></p>
    <p>You would have realized an $80,000 loss!</p>
    <p><strong>An $80,000 loss!</strong></p>
    <p>You would&rsquo;ve wiped out&nbsp;<strong>80% of your account</strong>&nbsp;and the price only moved&nbsp;<strong>4%</strong>!</p>
    <p>And you would probably look like something like this.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2010/08/02213625/forex-trader-yelling.png"  /></p>
    <p>Do you now see the effects of leverage?!</p>
    <p><strong>Leverage amplifies the movement in the relative prices of a currency pair by the factor of the leverage in your account.</strong></p>
