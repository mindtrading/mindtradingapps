    <p><strong>Margin&nbsp;</strong>can be thought of as a good faith deposit or&nbsp;<em>collateral&nbsp;</em>that&rsquo;s needed to open a position and keep it open.</p>
    <p>Margin trading gives you the ability to enter into positions LARGER than your account balance.</p>
    <p>Although buying and selling on<strong>&nbsp;margin does not provide leverage in and of itself</strong>, it can be used as a form of leverage.</p>
    <p>This is because how big of a position size you can open typically depends on how much money you have in your account.</p>
    <p>Trading currencies on&nbsp;<strong>margin</strong>&nbsp;let&nbsp;you increase your&nbsp;<em>buying (and selling) power</em>.</p>

    <p>This means that if you have $5,000 cash in a margin account that allows&nbsp;<strong>100:1 leverage</strong>, you could trade up to&nbsp;<strong>$500,000</strong>&nbsp;worth of currency because you only have to post one percent of the purchase price as collateral.</p>
    <p>Another way of saying this is that you have $500,000 in buying power.</p>
    <p>With more buying power, you can increase your total return on investment with less cash outlay. But be careful, trading on margin magnifies your profits&nbsp;<strong>AND</strong>&nbsp;losses.</p>
    <h2>Margin Call</h2>
    <p>All traders fear the dreaded margin call.</p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s not a great feeling.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/senior-margin-call-puke.png"  /></p>
    <p>This occurs when your broker notifies you that your margin deposits have fallen below the required minimum level because an open position has moved against you too much.</p>
    <p>While trading on margin can be profitable, it is important that you take the time to understand the risks.</p>
    <p>Make sure you&nbsp;<em>fully</em>&nbsp;understand how your margin account works, and be sure to read the&nbsp;<strong>margin agreement</strong>&nbsp;between you and your broker.</p>
    <p>Always ask any questions if there is anything unclear to you in the agreement.</p>
    <p>Your positions could be&nbsp;<strong>partially or totally liquidated</strong>&nbsp;should the available margin in your account fall below a predetermined threshold.</p>
    <p><strong>You may not receive a margin call before your positions are liquidated</strong>&nbsp;(the ultimate unexpected birthday gift).</p>
    <p>In the event that money in your account falls below margin requirements (usable margin), your broker will close some or all open positions.</p>
    <p>This can help prevent your account from falling into a negative balance, even in a highly volatile, fast-moving market.</p>
    <p>Margin calls can be effectively avoided by monitoring your account balance on a very regular basis and by utilizing stop loss orders on every open position to limit risk.</p>
    <p>Keep in mind though that your stop loss may experience massive slippage when the market is moving fast!</p>
    <p>The topic of margin is a touchy subject and some argue that too much margin is dangerous. It all depends on the individual and the amount of knowledge and training he or she has.</p>
    <p>If you are going to trade on a margin account, it&rsquo;s vital that you know what your broker&rsquo;s policies are on margin accounts and that you understand and are comfortable with the risks involved.</p>
    <p>You should also know that&nbsp;<strong>most brokers require a higher margin during the weekends</strong>. This may take the form of a 1% margin during the week and if you intend to hold the position over the weekend it may rise to 2% or higher.</p>
    <p>Brokers also may have&nbsp;<strong>different margin requirements for different currency pairs</strong>&nbsp;so pay attention to that as well!</p>
