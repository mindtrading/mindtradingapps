    <p>Let&rsquo;s discuss leverage and margin and the difference between the two.</p>
    <h2>What is leverage?</h2>
    <p>We know we&rsquo;ve tackled this before, but this topic is so important, we felt the need to discuss it again.</p>
    <p><strong>The textbook definition of &ldquo;leverage&rdquo; is having the ability to control a large amount of money using none or very little of your own money and borrowing the rest.</strong></p>
    <p><img rc="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/senior-toxic-leverage.png"  />For example, to control a $100,000 position, your broker will set aside $1,000 from your account. Your leverage, which is expressed in ratios, is now 100:1.</p>
    <p>You&rsquo;re now controlling&nbsp;<strong>$100,000 with $1,000</strong>.</p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s say the $100,000 investment rises in value to $101,000 or $1,000.</p>
    <p>If you had to come up with the entire $100,000 capital yourself, your return would be a puny 1% ($1,000 gain / $100,000 initial investment).</p>
    <p>This is also called 1:1&nbsp;<strong>leverage.</strong></p>
    <p>Of course, I think 1:1 leverage is a misnomer because if you have to come up with the entire amount you&rsquo;re trying to control, where is the leverage in that?</p>
    <p>Fortunately, you&rsquo;re not leveraged 1:1,&nbsp;<strong>you&rsquo;re leveraged 100:1</strong>.</p>
    <p>The broker only had to put aside $1,000 of your money, so your return is a groovy 100% ($1,000 gain / $1,000 initial investment).</p>
    <p>Now we want you to do a quick exercise. Calculate what your return would be if you lost $1,000.</p>
    <p>If you calculated it the same way we did, which is also called the correct way, you would have ended up with a -1% return using 1:1 leverage and a WTF! -100% return using 100:1 leverage.</p>
    <p>You&rsquo;ve probably heard the good ol&rsquo; clich&eacute;s like &ldquo;Leverage is a double-edged sword.&rdquo; or &ldquo;Leverage is a two-way street.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>As you can see, these clich&eacute;s weren&rsquo;t lying.</p>
    <h2>What is margin?</h2>
    <p>So what about the term &ldquo;margin&rdquo;? Excellent question.</p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s go back to the earlier example:</p>
    <p>In forex, to control a $100,000 position, your broker will set aside $1,000 from your account. Your leverage, which is expressed in&nbsp;<strong>ratios</strong>, is now&nbsp;<strong>100:1</strong>. You&rsquo;re now&nbsp;<em>controlling</em>&nbsp;$100,000 with $1,000.</p>
    <p>The $1,000 deposit is &ldquo;margin&rdquo; you had to give in order to use leverage.</p>
    <p><strong>Margin is the amount of money needed as a &ldquo;good faith deposit&rdquo; to open a position with your broker.</strong></p>
    <p>Margin is usually expressed as a&nbsp;<strong>percentage of the full amount of the position</strong>. For example, most forex brokers say they require 2%, 1%, .5% or .25% margin.</p>
    <p>Based on the margin required by your broker, you can calculate the maximum leverage you can wield with your trading account.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/senior-crunk.png" /></p>
    <p>If your broker requires a 2% margin, you have a leverage of 50:1.</p>
    <p>Here are the other popular leverage &ldquo;flavors&rdquo; most brokers offer:</p>

    <div>
    <table border="1px" width="100%">
    <tbody>
    <tr>
    <th>MARGIN REQUIREMENT</th>
    <th>MAXIMUM LEVERAGE</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>5.00%</td>
    <td>20:1</td>

    <td>33:1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>2.00%</td>
    <td>50:1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>1.00%</td>
    <td>100:1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>0.50%</td>
    <td>200:1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>0.25%</td>
    <td>400:1</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>
    </div>
    </div>
    <p>Aside from &ldquo;<strong>margin requirement</strong>&ldquo;, you will probably see other &ldquo;margin&rdquo; terms in your trading platform.</p>
    <p>There is much confusion about what these different &ldquo;margins&rdquo; mean so we will try our best to define each term:</p>
    <p><strong>Margin requirement:&nbsp;</strong>This is an easy one because we just talked about it. It is the amount of money your broker requires you to open a position. It is expressed in percentages.</p>
    <p><strong>Account balance:&nbsp;</strong>This is just another phrase for your trading bankroll. It&rsquo;s the total amount of money you have in your trading account.</p>
    <p><strong>Used margin:&nbsp;</strong>The amount of money that your broker has &ldquo;locked up&rdquo; to keep your current positions open.</p>
    <p>While this money is still yours, you can&rsquo;t touch it until your broker gives it back to you either when you manually close your current positions or when a position is automatically closed by your broker.</p>
    <p><strong>Usable margin:&nbsp;</strong>This is the money in your account that is available to open new positions.</p>
    <p><strong>Margin call:&nbsp;</strong>You get this when the amount of money in your account cannot cover your possible loss.&nbsp;It happens when your&nbsp;equity&nbsp;falls below your used margin.</p>
    <p>If a margin call occurs, your broker will ask you to deposit more money in your account. If you don&rsquo;t, some or all open positions will be closed by the broker at the market price.</p>
