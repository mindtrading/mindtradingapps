    <p>Besides amplifying your losses, leverage also has another way of killing you.</p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s a much slower kind of death though, kinda like dying by a thousand cuts.</p>
    <p>Most forex traders don&rsquo;t see it coming and by the time they notice it, they&rsquo;re DEAD.</p>
    <p>This killer we&rsquo;re talking about is the&nbsp;<strong>associated transaction costs of using high leverage.</strong></p>
    <p>Not only does leverage amplify your losses, but it also&nbsp;<strong>amplifies your transaction costs as a percentage of your account</strong>.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/senior-transaction-costs.png" /></p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s say you open a mini account with $500.</p>
    <p>You buy five mini $10k lots of GBP/USD which has a 5 pip spread. Your true leverage is 100:1 ($50,000 total mini lots / $500 account).</p>
    <p>But check this&hellip;.you paid $25 in transaction costs (($1/pip x 5 pip spread) x 5 lots)).</p>
    <p>That is&nbsp;<strong>5%</strong>&nbsp;of your account!</p>
    <p>With one trade, and the market not even moving yet, you&rsquo;re already down 5%! If your trades lose, your account balance shrinks.</p>
    <p>As your account balance shrinks, your leverage increases.</p>
    <p>As your leverage increases, the faster your transaction costs eat away at the little money you have left.</p>
    <p>This is the slow and silent killer I&rsquo;m talking about.</p>
    <p>The higher your leverage, the higher your transaction cost as a percentage of your trading capital.</p>
    <p>This is why transaction costs are one of the six most important factors when choosing a broker.</p>
    <p>For example, if you go long 10,000 units of EUR?USD with a 5-pip spread, which equals $5 transaction cost, look at how the relative value of your transaction costs increases with more leverage.</p>

    <p>Now you&rsquo;ve learned how leverage can magnify your profits and losses, but also your transaction costs.</p>
    <p><strong>Leverage does not equal margin.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Leverage is how many times you lever your whole account.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>The maximum amount that you are allowed to lever is dependent on your margin requirement.</strong></p>
