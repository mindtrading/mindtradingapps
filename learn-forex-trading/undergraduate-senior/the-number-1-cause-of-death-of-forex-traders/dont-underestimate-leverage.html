    <p>Leverage is a very powerful tool but both old and new traders use it to destroy their trading capital simply because they take its destructive force too lightly or ignore it altogether.</p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s a pity, but the more of them there are, the easier it is for us smart traders to make money. Sad but true.</p>
    <p>Always keep in mind these words from a famous superhero:</p>
    <p>&ldquo;With great power comes great responsibility.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Or something to that effect. Come on, we know you&rsquo;ve seen that movie.</p>
    <p>Here&rsquo;s a clue:</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/freshman-spider.png"  /></p>
    <p>Get it?</p>
    <p>Anyway, high leverage is a favorite selling point for most forex brokers.</p>
    <p>Yes, they pitch that you can make a huge killing using huge leverage, but also know that you could easily be killed by huge leverage as well.</p>
    <p><strong>Most brokers want you to trade with a short-term mindset.</strong></p>
    <p>They want you to trade as much as possible as often as possible.</p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s the only way they make money. One or two pips are important to them.</p>
    <p>The more you trade the more they make on the spread.</p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s not in their best interest to tell you to let your trades run longer than the same day.</p>
    <p>If you want to give yourself the best chance to succeed, first learn to trade profitably without leverage.</p>
    <p><strong><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/freshman-safety-first.png" />Play it safe. Protect your capital.</strong></p>
    <p>When you can consistently make more pips more than you lose then, and only then, should you use unleash this weapon of mass destruction called&nbsp;<strong>leverage</strong>?</p>
    <p>Destroy traders taking the opposite side of your trade. Don&rsquo;t destroy yourself.</p>
    <p>Forex trading should be treated as a job or business.</p>
    <p>Don&rsquo;t think that just because brokers allow you to use high leverage with a low minimum deposit that you can &ldquo;make a quick &rdquo; or &ldquo;get rich quick&rdquo;. Approach the currency markets with respect.</p>
    <p>Be realistic in your expectations and be willing to properly educate yourself.</p>
    <p>If you don&rsquo;t, you will die.</p>
    <p>Okay, not really, but your account will die.</p>
