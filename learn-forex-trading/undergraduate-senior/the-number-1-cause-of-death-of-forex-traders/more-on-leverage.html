    <p>As a trader, it is&nbsp;<strong>crucial</strong>&nbsp;that you understand both the benefits AND the pitfalls of trading with leverage.</p>
    <p>Using a ratio of&nbsp;<strong>100:1</strong>&nbsp;as an example means that it is possible to enter into a trade for up to&nbsp;<strong>$100&nbsp;for every $1</strong>&nbsp;in your&nbsp;account.</p>
    <p>With as little as $1,000 of margin available in your account, you can trade up to $100,000 at 100:1 leverage.</p>
    <p>This gives you the potential to earn&nbsp;profits on the equivalent of a $100,000 trade!</p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s like a super scrawny dude who has&nbsp;a super long forearm entering an arm-wrestling match.</p>
    <p>If he knows what he&rsquo;s doing, it doesn&rsquo;t matter if his opponent is&nbsp;Arnold Schwarzenegger, due to the leverage that his forearm can generate, he&rsquo;ll usually come out on top.</p>

    <p>When leverage works, it magnifies your gains substantially. Your head gets BIG and you think you&rsquo;re the greatest trader that has ever lived.</p>
    <p>But&nbsp;<strong>leverage can also work against you</strong>.</p>
    <p>If your trade moves in the opposite direction, leverage will AMPLIFY your potential losses.</p>
    <p>You&rsquo;ll be broke faster than Mike Tyson can chew your ear off.</p>
    <p>Here&rsquo;s a chart of how much your account balance changes if prices move depending on your leverage.</p>

    <p><strong>The more leverage you use, the less &ldquo;breathing room&rdquo; you have for the market to move before a margin call.</strong></p>
    <p>You&rsquo;re probably thinking, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a day trader, I&nbsp;don&rsquo;t need no stinkin&rsquo; breathing room. I only use 20-30 pip stop losses.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Okay, let&rsquo;s take a look:</p>
    <h2>Example #1</h2>
    <p>You open a mini account with $500 which trades 10k mini lots and only requires a .5% margin.</p>
    <p>You buy 2 mini lots of EUR/USD.</p>
    <p>Your true leverage is&nbsp;<strong>40:1</strong>&nbsp;($20,000 / $500).</p>
    <p>You place a 30-pip stop loss and it gets triggered. Your loss is&nbsp;<strong>$60</strong>&nbsp;($1/pip x 2 lots).</p>
    <p>You&rsquo;ve just lost&nbsp;<strong>12% of your account</strong>&nbsp;($60 loss / $500 account).</p>
    <p>Your account balance is now&nbsp;<strong>$440</strong>.</p>
    <p>You believe you just had a bad day. The next day, you&rsquo;re feeling good and want to recoup yesterday&rsquo;s losses, so you decide to double up and you buy 4 mini lots of EUR/USD.</p>
    <p>Your true leverage is about&nbsp;<strong>90:1</strong>&nbsp;($40,000 / $440).</p>
    <p>You set your usual 30-pip stop loss and your trade losses.</p>
    <p>Your loss is&nbsp;<strong>$120</strong>&nbsp;($1/pip x 4 lots).</p>
    <p>You&rsquo;ve just lost&nbsp;<strong>27% of your account</strong>&nbsp;($120 loss/ $440 account).</p>
    <p>Your account balance is now&nbsp;<strong>$320.</strong></p>
    <p>You believe the tide will turn so you trade again.</p>
    <p>You buy 2 mini lots of EUR/USD. Your true leverage is about&nbsp;<strong>63:1</strong>.</p>
    <p>You set your usual 30 pip stop loss and lose once again! Your loss is&nbsp;<strong>$60</strong>&nbsp;($1/pip x 2 lots).</p>
    <p>You&rsquo;ve just lost almost&nbsp;<strong>19% of your account</strong>&nbsp;($60 loss / $320 account). Your account balance is now $260.</p>
    <p>You&rsquo;re getting frustrated. You try to think about what you&rsquo;re doing wrong. You think you&rsquo;re setting your stops too tight.</p>
    <p>The next day you buy 3 mini lots of EUR/USD.</p>
    <p>Your true leverage is&nbsp;<strong>115:1 (</strong>$30,000 / $260).</p>
    <p>You&nbsp;<strong>loosen your stop loss</strong>&nbsp;to 50 pips. The trade starts going against you and it looks like you&rsquo;re about to get stopped out yet again!</p>
    <p>But what happens next is even worse!</p>
    <p><strong>You get a margin call!</strong></p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/senior-margin-call-puke.png" sizes="(max-width: 530px) 85vw, 530px" srcset="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/senior-margin-call-puke.png 530w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/senior-margin-call-puke-525x381.png 525w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/senior-margin-call-puke-300x218.png 300w" alt="Margin called!" width="530" height="385" /></p>
    <p>Since you opened 3 lots with a&nbsp;<strong>$260</strong>&nbsp;account, your Used Margin was&nbsp;<strong>$150</strong>&nbsp;so your Usable Margin was a measly&nbsp;<strong>$110</strong>.</p>
    <p>The trade went against you 37 pips and because you had 3 lots opened, you get a margin call. Your position has been liquidated at market price.</p>
    <p>The only money you have left in your account is&nbsp;<strong>$150</strong>, the Used Margin that was returned to you after the margin call.</p>
    <p>After four total trades, your trading account has gone from<strong>&nbsp;$500 to $150</strong>.</p>
    <p><strong>A 70% loss</strong>!</p>
    <p>Congratulations, it won&rsquo;t be very long until you lose the rest.</p>

    <p>A four-trade losing streak is not uncommon. Experienced traders have similar or even longer streaks.</p>
    <p>The reason they&rsquo;re successful is that they use&nbsp;<strong>low leverage</strong>.</p>
    <p><strong>Most cap their leverage at 5:1 but rarely go that high and stay around 3:1.</strong></p>
    <p>The other reason experienced traders succeed is that their accounts are properly capitalized!</p>
    <p>While learning technical analysis, fundamental analysis, sentiment analysis, building a system, trading psychology are important, we believe the biggest factor on whether you succeed as a forex trader is making sure you&nbsp;<strong>capitalize your account sufficiently and trade that capital with smart leverage</strong>.</p>
    <p>Your chances of becoming successful are greatly reduced below a minimum starting capital. It becomes impossible to mitigate the effects of leverage on too small an account.</p>
    <p>Low leverage with proper capitalization allows you to realize losses that are very small which not only lets you&nbsp;<strong>sleep at night</strong>, but allows you to&nbsp;<strong>trade another day</strong>.</p>
    <h2>Example #2</h2>
    <p>Bill opens a $5,000 account trading 100k lots. He is trading with&nbsp;<strong>20:1</strong>&nbsp;leverage.</p>
    <p>The currency pairs that he normally trades move anywhere from 70 to 200 pips on a daily basis. In order to protect himself, he uses tight 30 pip stops.</p>
    <p>If prices go 30 pips against him, he will be stopped out for a loss of $300.00. Bill feels that 30 pips are reasonable but he underestimates how volatile the market is and finds himself being stopped out frequently.</p>
    <p>After being stopped out four times, Bill has had enough. He decides to give himself a little more room, handle the swings, and increases his stop to 100 pips.</p>
    <p>Bill&rsquo;s leverage is no longer 20:1. His account is down to $3,800 (because of his four losses at $300 each) and he&rsquo;s still trading one 100k lot.</p>
    <p>His leverage is now over&nbsp;<strong>26:1</strong>.</p>
    <p>He decides to tighten his stops to 50 pips. He opens another trade using two lots and two hours later his 50 pip stop loss is hit and he losses $1,000.</p>
    <p>He now has $2,800 in his account. His leverage is over&nbsp;<strong>35:1</strong>.</p>
    <p>He tries again with two lots. This time the market goes up 10 pips. He cashes out with a $200 profit. His account grows slightly to $3,000.</p>
    <p>He opens another position with two lots. The market drops 50 points and he gets out. Now he has $2,000 left.</p>
    <p>He thinks &ldquo;What the hell?!&rdquo; and opens another position!</p>
    <p>The market proceeds to drop another 100 pips.</p>
    <p>Because he has $1,000 locked up as margin deposit, he only has $1,000 margin available, so he receives a margin call and his position is instantly liquidated!</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/senior-margin-call-puke.png" sizes="(max-width: 530px) 85vw, 530px" srcset="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/senior-margin-call-puke.png 530w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/senior-margin-call-puke-525x381.png 525w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/senior-margin-call-puke-300x218.png 300w" alt="Margin called!" width="530" height="385" /></p>
    <p>He now has $1,000 left which is not even enough to open a new position.</p>
    <p>He lost $4,000 or 80% of his account with a total of 8 trades and the market has only moved 280 pips. 280 pips! The market moves 280 pips pretty darn easy.</p>
    <p>Are you starting to see why leverage is the top killer of forex&nbsp;traders?</p>
