    <p>Most professional forex traders and money managers trade one standard lot for every $50,000 in their account.</p>
    <p>If they traded a mini account, this means they trade one mini lot for every $5,000 in their account.</p>
    <p>Let that sink into your head for a couple seconds.</p>
    <p>If pros trade like this, why do less experienced forex traders think they can succeed by trading 100K standard lots with a $2,000 account or 10K mini lots with $250?</p>
    <p>No matter what the forex brokers tell you, don&rsquo;t ever open a &ldquo;standard account&rdquo; with just $2,000 or a &ldquo;mini account&rdquo; with $250.</p>
    <p>Heck, some even allow you to open accounts with just $25!</p>
    <p>The number one reason new traders fail is not that they suck, but because they are undercapitalized&nbsp;from the start and&nbsp;<strong>don&rsquo;t understand how leverage really works</strong>.</p>

    <h2>Don&rsquo;t set yourself up to fail.</h2>
    <p>We recommend that you have at least have $100,000 of trading capital before opening a standard account, $10,000 for a mini account, or $1,000 for a micro account.</p>
    <p>Of course, open an account only when you are consistently good.</p>
    <p>So if you only have $60,000, open a mini account. If you only have $8,000, open a micro account.</p>
    <p>If you only have $250, open a demo account and stick with it until you come up with the additional $750, then open a micro account. If you have $1, find a job.</p>
    <p>If you don&rsquo;t remember anything else in this lesson, at least remember what you just read above.</p>
    <p>Okay, please re-read the previous paragraph and ingrain it in your memory. Just because brokers allow you to open an account with only $25 does NOT mean you should.</p>
    <p>Here&rsquo;s why:</p>
    <p><strong>We believe most new traders who open a forex trading account with the bare minimum deposit do so because they don&rsquo;t completely understand what the terms &ldquo;leverage&rdquo; and &ldquo;margin&rdquo; really are and how it affects their trading.</strong></p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s crucial that you&rsquo;re fully aware and free of ignorance of the significance of trading with leverage.</p>
    <p>If you don&rsquo;t have rock solid understanding of leverage and margin, we guarantee that&nbsp;<strong>you will&nbsp;BLOW YOUR TRADING ACCOUNT!</strong></p>
