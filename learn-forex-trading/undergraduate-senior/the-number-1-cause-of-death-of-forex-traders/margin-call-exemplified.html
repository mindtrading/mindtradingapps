    <p>Assume you are a successful retired British spy who now spends his time trading currencies. You open a mini account and deposit $10,000.</p>
    <p>When you first log in, you will see the $10,000 in the &ldquo;Equity&rdquo; column of your &ldquo;Account Information&rdquo; window.</p>
    <h2>Usable Margin</h2>
    <p>You will also see that the &ldquo;Used Margin&rdquo; is $0.00 and that the &ldquo;Usable Margin&rdquo; is $10,000, as pictured below:</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/senior-usable-margin000.png" /></p>
    <p>Your Usable Margin will always be equal to &ldquo;Equity&rdquo; less &ldquo;Used Margin.&rdquo;</p>
    <p><strong>Usable Margin = Equity &ndash; Used Margin</strong></p>
    <p>Therefore it is the Equity, NOT the Balance that is used to determine Usable Margin. Your Equity will also determine if and when a Margin Call is reached.</p>
    <p><strong>As long as your Equity is greater than your Used Margin, you will not have a Margin Call.</strong></p>
    <p>( Equity &gt; Used Margin ) = NO MARGIN CALL</p>
    <p><strong>As soon as your Equity equals or falls below your Used Margin, you will receive a margin call.</strong></p>
    <p>( Equity =&lt; Used Margin ) = MARGIN CALL, go back to demo trading!</p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s assume your margin requirement is&nbsp;<strong>1%</strong>. You buy 1 lot of EUR/USD.</p>
    <p>Your Equity remains&nbsp;<strong>$10,000.</strong>&nbsp;Used Margin is now&nbsp;<strong>$100</strong>&nbsp;because the margin required in a mini account is $100 per lot. The Usable Margin is now&nbsp;<strong>$9,900</strong>.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/senior-usable-margin-2.png" /></p>
    <p>If you were to close out that 1 lot of EUR/USD (by selling it back) at the same price at which you bought it, your Used Margin would go back to $0.00 and your Usable Margin would go back to $10,000. Your Equity would remain unchanged at 10,000.</p>
    <p>But instead of closing the 1 lot, you (the adrenaline junkie, chop-socky person that you are) got extremely confident and bought<strong>&nbsp;79 more lots</strong>&nbsp;of EUR/USD for a total of 80 lots of EUR/USD because that&rsquo;s just how you roll.</p>
    <p>You will still have the same Equity, but your Used Margin will be&nbsp;<strong>$8,000</strong>&nbsp;(80 lots at $100 margin per lot). And your Usable Margin will now only be&nbsp;<strong>$2,000</strong>, as shown below:</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/senior-usable-margin-3.png" /></p>
    <p>With this insanely risky position on, you will make a ridiculously large profit if EUR/USD rises. But this example does not end with such a fairy tale.</p>
    <p>Let us paint a horrific picture of a Margin Call that occurs when EUR/USD falls.</p>
    <p>EUR/USD starts to fall. You are long 80 lots, so you will see your Equity fall along with it.</p>
    <p>Your Used Margin will remain at $8,000.</p>
    <p>Once your equity drops below $8,000, you will have a Margin Call.</p>
    <p>This means that some or all of your 80 lot position will immediately be closed at the current market price.</p>
    <p>Assuming you bought all 80 lots at the same price, a Margin Call will trigger if your trade moves 25 pips against you.</p>
    <p>25 PIPS!</p>
    <p>Humbug! EUR/USD can move that much in its sleep!</p>
    <p>How did we come up with 25 pips? Well, each pip in a mini lot is worth $1 and you have a position open consisting of 80 freakin&rsquo; mini lots. So&hellip;</p>
    <p>$1/pip X 80 lots = $80/pip</p>
    <p>If EUR/USD goes up 1 pip, your equity increases by $80.</p>
    <p>If EUR/USD goes down 1 pip, your equity decreases by $80.</p>
    <p>$2,000 Usable Margin divided by $80/pip = 25 pips</p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s say you bought 80 lots of EUR/USD at $1.2000. This is how your account will look if it EUR/USD drops to $1.1975 or -25 pips.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/senior-usable-margin-4-1.png" /></p>
    <p>As you can see, your Usable Margin is now at $0.00 and you will receive a MARGIN CALL!</p>
    <p>Of course, you&rsquo;re a veteran international spy and you&rsquo;ve faced much bigger calamities.</p>
    <p>You&rsquo;ve got ice in your veins and your heart rate is still 55 bpm.</p>
    <p>After the margin call this is how your account will look:</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/senior-usable-margin-5.png" /></p>
    <p>EUR/USD moves 25 PIPS, or less than .22% ((1.2000 &ndash; 1.1975) / 1.2000) X 100% and you LOSE $2,000!</p>
    <p>You blew 20% of your trading account! (($2,000 loss / $10,000 balance)) X 100%</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/senior-overleveraged.png" /></p>
    <p>In reality, it&rsquo;s normal for EUR/USD to move 25 pips in a couple of seconds during a major economic data release, and definitely that much within a trading day.</p>
    <p><strong>Oh, we almost forget&hellip;we didn&rsquo;t even factor in the SPREAD!</strong></p>
    <p>To simplify the example, we didn&rsquo;t even factor in the spread, but we will now make this example super realistic.</p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s say the spread for EUR/USD is 3 pips. This means that EUR/USD really only has to move 22 pips, NOT 25 pips before a margin call.</p>
    <p>Imagine losing $2,000 in 5 seconds?!</p>
    <p>This is what could happen if you don&rsquo;t understand the mechanics of margin and how to use leverage.</p>
    <p>The sad fact is that most new traders don&rsquo;t even open a mini account with $10,000.</p>
    <p>Because you had at least $10,000, you were at least able to weather 25 pips before his margin call.</p>
    <p>If you only started off with $9,000, you would have only been able&nbsp;to weather a 10 pip drop (including spread) before receiving a margin call. 10 pips!</p>
