    <p>The forex market is like a schizophrenic patient suffering from bipolar disorder who constantly eats chocolates, experiences extreme sugar highs, and has volatile mood swings all day long.</p>
    <p>We&rsquo;re not even exaggerating.</p>
    <p>Although currency correlations between currency pairs can be strong or weak for days, weeks, months, or even years, they&nbsp;<em>do</em>&nbsp;eventually change and can change when you least expect it.</p>
    <p>The strong currency correlations you see this month may be totally different next month.</p>
    <p>Have a look at the table below.</p>

    <p>Compare the coefficients for a given pair across the different time frames.</p>
    <p>Do you notice anything?</p>
    <p>For the most part (thanks, USD/JPY!), they&rsquo;re different across the board, changing from one time frame to another. And they change in all directions.</p>
    <p><strong>The lesson here is that currency correlations do change, and they change frequently.</strong></p>
    <p>And they can change by a drastic measure in a short time frame, as is apparent by looking at EUR/USD at the 1 Month and 3 Month interval.</p>
    <p>That&rsquo;s a big swing!</p>
    <p>Because of the constant sentiment shifts of the currency market, make sure you&rsquo;re aware of the current currency correlations.</p>
    <p>For example, over a one-week period, the correlation between USD/JPY and USD/CHF was 0.22. This is a&nbsp;<strong>very low correlation coefficient</strong>&nbsp;and would indicate that the pairs have an insignificant correlation.</p>
    <p>However, if we look at the three-month data for the same time period, the number increases to 0.52 and then to 0.78 for six months and finally to 0.74 for a year.</p>
    <p>In this example, you can see that these two pairs had a &ldquo;break-up&rdquo; in their long-term correlation relationship.&nbsp;<strong>What was once a strongly positive association in the past has extremely weakened in the short term.</strong></p>
    <p>If they were a real couple and had only dated a month or less, they would&rsquo;ve thought they were incompatible.</p>
    <p>Little do they know, the passion will start heating up later!</p>
    <p>If you look at EUR/USD and GBP/USD, here&rsquo;s an&nbsp;example of the extent to which currency correlations can change and jump around.</p>
    <p>The one-week period shows a very strong correlation with a 0.94 coefficient!</p>
    <p>&hellip;But this relationship severely deteriorates in the one-month period, dropping to<strong>&nbsp;0.13,</strong>&nbsp;before improving again for its three-month period to a solid&nbsp;<strong>0.83</strong>, then deteriorating again to a weak correlation in its six-month trailing period.</p>

    <p>Their one-year correlation coefficient was&nbsp;<strong>-0.69</strong>.</p>
    <p>This indicates a moderate to strong correlation.</p>
    <p>But if you look at their one-month correlation, the correlation coefficient essentially flip-flopped!</p>
    <p>So be careful.</p>
    <p>Currency correlations change for many different reasons.</p>
    <p>These can include anything from a country changing interest rates, to shifting monetary policies, or any collection of economic or political events reshaping traders&rsquo; sentiment on a currency.</p>
