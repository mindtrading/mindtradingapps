    <p>Like synchronized swimmers, some currency pairs move in tandem with each other.</p>
    <p>And like magnets of the same poles that touch, other currency pairs move in opposite directions.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2010/07/swimmers.png" alt="" />When you are simultaneously trading multiple currency pairs in your trading account, the most important thing is to make sure you&rsquo;re aware of your&nbsp;<strong>RISK EXPOSURE</strong></p>
    <p>You might believe that you&rsquo;re spreading or diversifying your risk by trading in different pairs, but you should know that many of them tend to move in the same direction.</p>
    <p>By trading pairs that are highly correlated, you are just magnifying your risk!</p>
    <p>Correlations between pairs can be strong or weak and last for weeks, months, or even years. But always know that they can change on a dime.</p>
    <p>Staying up-to-date with currency correlations can&nbsp;help you make better decisions if you want to leverage, hedge, or diversify your trades.</p>
    <h2>A few&nbsp;things to remember&hellip;</h2>
    <p><strong><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/senior-reminder2.png" alt="" />Coefficients</strong>&nbsp;are calculated using daily closing prices.</p>
    <p><strong>Positive coefficients</strong>&nbsp;indicate that the two currency pairs are positively correlated, meaning they generally move in the same direction.</p>
    <p><strong>Negative coefficients</strong>&nbsp;indicate that the two currency pairs are negatively correlated, meaning they generally move in opposite directions.</p>
    <p>Correlation coefficient values near or at +1 or -1 mean the two currency pairs are highly related.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2010/07/correlation-coefficient.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>Correlations can be used to hedge, diversify, leverage up positions, and keep you out of positions that might cancel each other out.</p>
    <h2>Currency Pairs that Typically Move in the SAME Direction</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>EUR/USD and GBP/USD</li>
    <li>EUR/USD and AUD/USD</li>
    <li>EUR/USD and NZD/USD</li>
    <li>USD/CHF and USD/JPY</li>
    <li>AUD/USD and NZD/USD</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Currency Pairs That Typically Move in the OPPOSITE Direction</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>EUR/USD&nbsp;and&nbsp;USD/CHF</li>
    <li>GBP/USD and USD/JPY</li>
    <li>USD/CAD and AUD/USD</li>
    <li>USD/JPY and AUD/USD</li>
    <li>GBP/USD and USD/CHF</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When you find yourself wanting to trade two pairs that are highly correlated, it&rsquo;s okay if you take both setups.</p>
    <p>Just make sure you have rules in place when you traded correlated pairs and always stick to your risk management rules!</p>
