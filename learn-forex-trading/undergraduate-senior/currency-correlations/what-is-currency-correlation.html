    <p>Have you ever noticed that when a certain currency pair&nbsp;<strong>rises</strong>, another currency pair&nbsp;<strong>falls</strong>?</p>
    <p>Or how about when that same currency pair falls, another currency pair seems to copy it and falls also?</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2010/07/currency-correlation-example.png" /></p>
    <p>If the answer is &ldquo;yes,&rdquo; you&rsquo;ve just witnessed currency correlation in action!</p>
    <p>If you answered &ldquo;no,&rdquo; you need to stop doing less important things like sleeping, eating, playing Fortnite, and instead spend more time watching charts.</p>
    <p>But no worries because we&rsquo;re going to start with the basics and break it down yo&hellip;</p>
    <p><strong>Currency. Correlation.</strong></p>
    <p>The first half&hellip; easy. Currency. No explanation is needed.</p>
    <p>The second half. Still easy. Correlation: a relationship between two things.</p>
    <p>In this lesson, you&rsquo;ll learn what currency correlation is and how you can use it to help you become a smarter trader and make more responsible risk management decisions.</p>
    <h2>What is Currency Correlation?</h2>
    <p>In the financial world, correlation is a statistical measure of how two securities&nbsp;<strong>move in relation to each other.</strong></p>
    <p><strong><em>Currency</em>&nbsp;correlation</strong>, then, tells us&nbsp;<strong>whether two currency pairs move in the same, opposite, or totally random direction</strong>, over some period of time.</p>
    <p>When trading currencies, it&rsquo;s important to remember that since currencies are traded in pairs,&nbsp;<strong>no single currency pair is ever totally isolated</strong>. (Did we just confuse you with our &ldquo;currencies&rdquo; tongue-twister sentence there?)</p>
    <p>Unless you plan on trading just one pair at a time, it&rsquo;s crucial that you understand how different currency pairs move in relation to each other.</p>
    <p>ESPECIALLY if you&rsquo;re not familiar with how currency correlations can affect the&nbsp;<strong>amount of risk</strong>&nbsp;you&rsquo;re exposing your trading account to.</p>
    <p>If you don&rsquo;t know what the heck you&rsquo;re doing when trading multiple pairs simultaneously in your trading account, you can get KILLED!</p>
    <p>Murdefied! Destroyed! We can&rsquo;t stress this enough.</p>

    <p>Do NOT be ignorant about correlations.</p>
    <h2>Correlation Coefficient</h2>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/senior-nerdy-boy-calculating-correlations.png" /></p>
    <p>Correlation is computed into what is known as the correlation coefficient, which ranges between&nbsp;<strong>-1 and +1</strong>.</p>
    <p>The correlation coefficient measures how strongly two variables are related to each other. It&rsquo;s like a relationship status for data points: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s complicated&rdquo;, &ldquo;Just friends&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Soulmates&rdquo;.</p>
    <p><strong>Perfect positive correlation</strong>&nbsp;(a correlation coefficient of +1) implies that the two currency pairs will move in the&nbsp;<em>same</em>&nbsp;direction 100% of the time.</p>
    <p><strong>Perfect negative correlation</strong>&nbsp;(a correlation coefficient of -1) means that the two currency pairs will move in the&nbsp;<em>opposite</em>&nbsp;direction 100% of the time.</p>
    <p><strong>If the correlation is 0</strong>, the movements between two currency pairs are said to have uh ZERO or NO correlation, they are completely independent and&nbsp;<em>random from each other</em>.&nbsp;We have no idea how one pair will move in relation to the other.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2010/07/correlation-coefficient.png" /></p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s important to remember that c<strong>orrelation does not imply causation</strong>.</p>
    <p>Just because two things move together doesn&rsquo;t mean one causes the other. It&rsquo;s like saying just because roosters crow before sunrise doesn&rsquo;t mean the crowing causes the sun to rise.</p>
