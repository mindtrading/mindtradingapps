    <p>When you are simultaneously trading multiple currency pairs in your trading account,<strong>&nbsp;always make sure you&rsquo;re aware of your RISK EXPOSURE</strong>.</p>
    <p>For example, on most occasions, trading AUD/USD and NZD/USD are essentially like having two identical trades open because they usually have a positive correlation.</p>
    <p>You might believe that you&rsquo;re spreading or diversifying your risk by trading in different pairs, but&nbsp;<strong>many pairs tend to move in the same direction</strong>.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/senior-risk-exposure.png" />So instead of reducing risk, you are magnifying your risk! Unknowingly, you are actually&nbsp;<em>exposing yourself to MORE risk</em>.</p>
    <p>This is known as&nbsp;<strong>overexposure</strong>.</p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s look at an example involving two highly correlated pairs within a&nbsp;<strong>one-week</strong>&nbsp;period: the EUR/USD and GBP/USD.</p>
    <div>
    <div>

    <p>Based on the table, with a sexy correlation coefficient of 0.94, there&rsquo;s obviously a high correlation in this particular pair. EUR/USD is the peanut butter to GBP/USD&lsquo;s jelly! Like oil and water.&nbsp;Like Ben &amp; Jerry&rsquo;s!</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2010/07/ben-and-jerry.jpg"  /></p>
    <p>Okay, you get the picture. The point is that the two pairs hold hands, sing &ldquo;Kum Bay Yah&rdquo;, and skip together.</p>
    <h2>Currency Correlation Example #1: EUR/USD and GBP/USD</h2>
    <p>To prove to you that the numbers don&rsquo;t lie, here are their 4-hour charts. Notice how they both moved in the same direction&hellip;down.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/senior-eurusd-correlations.png"  /></p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/senior-gbpusd-correlations.png" /></p>
    <p>Returning to the subject of risk, we can see that opening a position in both the EUR/USD and the GBP/USD is the same as&nbsp;<strong>doubling up</strong>&nbsp;on a position.</p>
    <p>For example, if you bought 1 lot of EUR/USD and bought 1 lot of GBP/USD, you&rsquo;re basically buying&nbsp;<strong>2 lots</strong>&nbsp;of EUR/USD, because both the EUR/USD and GBP/USD would move in the same direction anyway.</p>
    <p>In other words, you are INCREASING your risk. If you buy EUR/USD and GBP/USD, you don&rsquo;t get two chances to be wrong!</p>
    <p>All you get is one chance because if EUR/USD falls and you get stopped out, GBP/USD will most likely fall and stop you out also (or vice versa).</p>
    <p>You also wouldn&rsquo;t want to buy EUR/USD and sell GBP/USD at the same time because if EUR/USD skyrockets, then GBP/USD would probably skyrocket also and where does this leave you?</p>
    <p>If you think your profit or loss will always be zero, then you&rsquo;re wrong. EUR/USD and GBP/USD have different pip values and just because they are highly correlated doesn&rsquo;t mean they always move in the same exact pip range.</p>
    <p><strong>Volatility within currency pairs is fickle.</strong></p>
    <p>EUR/USD can skyrocket 200 pips, while GBP/USD only goes up 190 pips. If this happens, the losses from your GBP/USD trade (because you were short), will eat up most, if not all, of the gains from your EUR/USD trade.</p>
    <p>Now let&rsquo;s imagine that EUR/USD was the pair that moved up 190 pips, and GBP/USD had the bigger move of 200 pips. You would&rsquo;ve definitely had a LOSS!</p>
    <p><strong>Going long one currency pair and going short another currency pair that are highly correlated is extremely counterproductive.</strong></p>
    <p>More than paying for the spread twice, you minimize your gain because one pair eats into the other pair&rsquo;s profits.</p>
    <p>And even worse, you could end up losing due to the different pip values and ever-changing volatility of currency pairs.</p>
    <h2>Currency Correlation Example #2: EUR/USD and USD/CHF</h2>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at another example. This time with the EUR/USD and USD/CHF.</p>
    <p>While we just saw a strong positive correlation with the GBP/USD, the EUR/USD has a very negative correlation with the USD/CHF.</p>
    <p>If we look at its one-week correlation, it has a perfect correlation coefficient of -1.00. It doesn&rsquo;t get any more opposite than this folks! Instead of Ben &amp; Jerry&rsquo;s, they&rsquo;re Tom and Jerry!</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2010/07/tom-and-jerry.png" /></p>
    <p>EUR/USD and USD/CHF are like fire and water, Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd. Superman and kryptonite, Boston Celtics and Los Angeles Lakers, Manchester United, and Liverpool.</p>
    <p>These two pairs totally move in opposite directions. Check out the charts:</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/senior-eurusd-correlations.png" /></p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/senior-usdchf-correlations.png" /></p>
    <p>Taking&nbsp;<strong>opposite</strong>&nbsp;positions on the two negatively correlated pairs would be similar to taking the&nbsp;<strong>same</strong>&nbsp;position on two highly positive correlated pairs.</p>
    <p><strong>Buying EUR/USD and selling USD/CHF would be the same as doubling up on a position.</strong></p>
    <p>For example, if you bought 1 lot of EUR/USD and sold 1 lot of USD/CHF, you&rsquo;re basically buying 2 lots of EUR/USD, because if EUR/USD goes up, then USD/CHF goes down, and you&rsquo;d be making money on both pairs.</p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s important to recognize though that you have INCREASED your risk exposure in your trading account if you do this.</p>
    <p>Returning to the example with you being long EUR/USD and short USD/CHF, if EUR/USD actually dropped like a rock, most likely both of your trades would be stopped out resulting in two losses.</p>
    <p><strong>You could&rsquo;ve minimized your loss by simply deciding to go long EUR/USD&nbsp;<em>OR</em>&nbsp;go short USD/CHF, instead of doing both.</strong></p>
    <p>On the other hand, buying (or selling) both EUR/USD and USD/CHF at the&nbsp;same time is&nbsp;usually counterproductive since you&rsquo;re basically&nbsp;<strong>canceling</strong>&nbsp;each trade out.</p>
    <p>Because the two pairs move in opposite directions like they hate each other&rsquo;s guts, one side will make money, but the other will lose money.</p>
    <p>So you either end up with little gain because one pair eats into the other pair&rsquo;s profits.</p>
    <p>Or you could simply end up with a loss due to each pair&rsquo;s different pip values and volatility ranges.</p>
