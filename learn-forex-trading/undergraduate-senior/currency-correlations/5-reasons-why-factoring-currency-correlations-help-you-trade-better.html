    <p><strong>Currency correlation</strong>&nbsp;tells us whether two currency pairs move in the same, opposite, or totally random direction, over some period of time.</p>
    <p>When trading currencies, it&rsquo;s important to remember that since currencies are traded in pairs, that no single currency pair is ever totally isolated.</p>
    <p>Correlation is computed into what is known as the&nbsp;<strong>correlation coefficient</strong>, which ranges between&nbsp;<strong>-1 and +1</strong>.</p>
    <p>Here is a guide for interpreting the different currency correlation coefficient values.</p>

    <tr>
    <td><strong>-1.0</strong></td>
    <td>Perfect inverse correlation</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><strong>-0.8</strong></td>
    <td>Very strong inverse correlation</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><strong>-0.6</strong></td>
    <td>Strong, high inverse correlation</td>

    <td><strong>-0.4</strong></td>
    <td>Moderate inverse correlation</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><strong>-0.2</strong></td>
    <td>Weak, low inverse correlation</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><strong>0</strong></td>
    <td>No correlation. Totally random.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><strong>0.2</strong></td>
    <td>Very weak, insignificant correlation</td>
    </tr>

    <td>Weak, low correlation</td>

    <p>So now you know what currency correlation is and how to read it off a fancy chart.</p>
    <p>But we bet you&rsquo;re wondering how using currency correlations will make your trading more successful?</p>
    <p>Why do you need this wondrous skill in your trader&rsquo;s tool bag?</p>
    <p>There are several reasons:</p>
    <h2>1. Eliminate counterproductive trading</h2>
    <p>Utilizing correlations can help you stay out of positions that will cancel each other out.</p>
    <p>As the previous lesson showed, we know that EUR/USD and USD/CHF move in the opposite direction almost 100%.</p>
    <p>Opening a position long EUR/USD AND long USD/CHF is, then, pointless and sometimes expensive. In addition to paying for the spread twice, any movement in the price would take one pair up and the other down.</p>
    <p>We want our hard work to pay off with something!</p>
    <h2>2. Leverage profits</h2>
    <p>Leverage profits&hellip;.or losses! You have the opportunity to double up on positions to maximize profits. Again, let&rsquo;s take a look at the 1-week EUR/USD and GBP/USD relationship from the&nbsp;example in the previous lesson.</p>
    <p>These two pairs have a strong positive correlation with GBP/USD following behind EUR/USD virtually step for step.</p>
    <p>Opening a long position for each pair would, in effect, be like taking EUR/USD and doubling your position.</p>
    <p>You&rsquo;d basically be making use of leverage!&nbsp;Mucho profit if all goes right and mucho losses if things go wrong!</p>
    <h2>3. Diversify risk</h2>
    <p>Understanding that correlations exist also allows you to use different currency pairs, but still leverage your point of view.</p>
    <p>Rather than trading a single currency pair all the time, you can spread your risk across two pairs that move the same way.</p>
    <p>Pick pairs that have a strong to very strong correlation (around 0.7). For example, EUR/USD and GBP/USD tend to move together.</p>
    <p>The imperfect correlation between these two currency pairs gives you the opportunity to diversify which helps reduce your risk. Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re bullish on the USD.</p>
    <p>Instead of opening two short positions of EUR/USD, you could short EUR/USD&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;short GBP/USD which would shield you from some risk and diversify your overall position.</p>
    <p>In the event that the U.S. dollar sells off, the euro might be affected to a lesser extent than the pound.</p>
    <h2>4. Hedge risk</h2>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/senior-hedge-your-position.png" />Although hedging can result in realizing smaller profits, it can also help to minimize losses.</p>
    <p>If you open a long EUR/USD position and it starts to go against you, open a small long position in a pair that moves opposite EUR/USD, such as USD/CHF.</p>
    <p>Major losses averted!</p>
    <p>You can take advantage of the different pip values for each currency pair.</p>
    <p>For example, while EUR/USD and USD/CHF have an almost perfect -1.0 inverse correlation, their pip values are different.</p>
    <p>Assuming you trade a 10,000 mini lot, one pip for EUR/USD equals $1 and one pip for USD/CHF equals $0.93.</p>
    <p>If you buy one mini lot EUR/USD, you can HEDGE your trade by buying one mini lot of USD/CHF. If EUR/USD falls 10 pips, you would be down $10. But your USD/CHF trade would be up to $9.30.</p>
    <p>Instead of being down $10, now you&rsquo;re only down $0.70!</p>
    <p>Even though hedging sounds like the greatest thing since sliced bread, it does have some disadvantages.</p>
    <p>If EUR/USD rallies, your profit is limited because of the losses from your USD/CHF position.</p>
    <p>Also, the correlation can weaken at any time. Imagine if EUR/USD falls 10 pips, and USD/CHF only goes up 5 pips, stays flat, or falls also!</p>
    <p>Your account will be bleeding redder than the Red Wedding in Game of Thrones.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2010/07/18104926/red-wedding.jpg" /></p>
    <p>So be careful when hedging!</p>
    <h2>5. Confirm breakouts and avoid fakeouts</h2>
    <p>You can use currency correlations to confirm your trade entry or exit signals.</p>
    <p>For example, the EUR/USD appears to be testing a significant support level. You observe the price action and are looking to sell on a&nbsp;breakout&nbsp;to the downside.</p>
    <p>Since you know EUR/USD is positively correlated with GBP/USD and negatively correlated with USD/CHF and USD/JPY, you check to see if the other three pairs are moving in the same magnitude as EUR/USD.</p>
    <p>You notice that GBP/USD is also trading near a significant support level and both the USD/CHF and USD/JPY are trading near key resistance levels.</p>
    <p>This tells you that the recent move is U.S. dollar-related and confirms a possible breakout for EUR/USD since the other three pairs are moving similarly. So you decide you will trade the breakout when it occurs.</p>
    <p>Now let&rsquo;s assume the other three pairs are NOT moving in the magnitude as EUR/USD.</p>
    <p>The GBP/USD is holding not falling, USD/JPY is not rising, and USD/CHF is sideways.</p>
    <p>This is usually a strong sign that the EUR/USD decline is not U.S. dollar-related and most likely driven by some kind of negative EU news.</p>
    <p>Price may actually trade below the key support level you&rsquo;ve been monitoring but because the other three correlated pairs aren&rsquo;t moving in proportion with EUR/USD, there will be a lack of any price follow-through and the price will return back above the support level resulting in a fakeout.</p>
    <p>If you still wanted to trade this setup, since you didn&rsquo;t get any &ldquo;correlation confirmation&rdquo; from the other pairs, you could play it smart by reducing your risk and trading with a smaller position size.</p>
