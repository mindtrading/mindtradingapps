    <p>What is risk management?</p>
    <p><strong>Risk management</strong>&nbsp;is one of the most important&nbsp;topics&nbsp;you will ever read about trading.</p>
    <p>Why is it important? Well, we are in the business of making money, and in order to make money, we have to learn how to manage risk (potential losses).</p>
    <p>Ironically, this is one of the most overlooked areas in trading.</p>
    <p>Many forex traders are just anxious to get right into trading with no regard for their total account size.</p>
    <p>They simply determine how much they can stomach to lose in a single trade and hit the &ldquo;trade&rdquo; button.</p>
    <p>There&rsquo;s a term for this type of investing&hellip;.it&rsquo;s called&hellip;</p>
    <p><strong>GAMBLING!</strong></p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/04/07162714/poor-risk-management-gambling.png" /></p>
    <p>When you trade without risk management rules, you are in fact&hellip;.<strong>gambling</strong>.</p>
    <p>You are not looking at the long-term return on your investment. Instead, you are only looking for that &ldquo;jackpot.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Risk&nbsp;management rules will not only protect you, but they can make you very profitable&nbsp;<strong>in the long run</strong>. If you don&rsquo;t believe us, and you think that &ldquo;gambling&rdquo; is the way to get rich, then consider this example:</p>
    <p><strong>People go to Las Vegas all the time to gamble their money in hopes of winning a big jackpot, and in fact, many people do win.</strong></p>
    <p>So how in the world are casinos still making money if many individuals are winning jackpots?</p>
    <p>The answer is that even though people win jackpots, in the long run, casinos are still profitable because they rake in more money from the people that don&rsquo;t win.</p>
    <p>That is where the term &ldquo;<strong>The house always wins.</strong>&rdquo; comes from.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/04/07162756/house-always-win-360x360.png" /></p>
    <p>The truth is that casinos are just very rich statisticians. They know that in the long run, they will be the ones making the money&ndash;not the gamblers.</p>
    <p>Even if Joe Schmoe wins a $100,000 jackpot in a slot machine, the casinos know that there will be hundreds of other gamblers who WON&rsquo;T win that jackpot and the money will go right back into their pockets.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/04/07162847/slot-machine-360x360.png" /></p>
    <p>This is a classic example of how statisticians make money over gamblers. Even though both lose money, the statistician, or casino in this case, knows how to control its losses.</p>
    <p>Essentially, this is how risk management works.</p>
    <p><strong>If you learn how to control your losses, you will have a chance of being profitable.</strong></p>
    <p>In the end, forex trading is a numbers game, meaning you have to tilt every little factor in your favor as much as you can.</p>
    <p>In casinos, the house edge is sometimes only 5% above that of the player. But that 5% is the difference between being a winner and being a loser.</p>
    <p>You want to be the rich statistician and&nbsp;<strong>NOT</strong>&nbsp;the gambler because, in the long run, you want to &ldquo;<strong>Be the winner in the long run</strong>.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>So how do you become this rich statistician instead of a loser? Keep reading!</p>
