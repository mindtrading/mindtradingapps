    <p>To increase your chances of profitability, you want to trade when you have the potential to make&nbsp;<strong>3 times more than you are risking</strong>.</p>
    <p>If you give yourself a 3:1&nbsp;<strong>reward-to-risk ratio</strong>, you have a significantly greater chance of ending up profitable in the long run.</p>
    <p>Take a look at the chart below as an example:</p>
    <div>
    <div>
    <table border="1px" width="100%">
    <tbody>
    <tr>
    <th>10 TRADES</th>
    <th>LOSS</th>
    <th>WIN</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><strong>1</strong></td>
    <td>$1,000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><strong>2</strong></td>
    <td>$3,000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><strong>3</strong></td>
    <td>$1,000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><strong>4</strong></td>
    <td>$3,000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><strong>5</strong></td>
    <td>$1,000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><strong>6</strong></td>
    <td>$3,000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><strong>7</strong></td>
    <td>$1,000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><strong>8</strong></td>
    <td>$3,000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><strong>9</strong></td>
    <td>$1,000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><strong>10</strong></td>
    <td>$3,000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><strong>Total</strong></td>
    <td>$5,000</td>
    <td>$15,000</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>
    </div>
    </div>
    <p>In this example, you can see that even if you only won 50% of your trades, you would still make a profit of $10,000.</p>
    <p>Just remember that whenever you trade with a good risk to reward ratio, your chances of being profitable are much greater even if you have a lower win percentage.</p>
    <p>BUT&hellip;</p>
    <p>And this is a big one.. setting a large reward-to-risk ratio comes at a price.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/junior-falling.png" /></p>
    <p>On the very surface, the concept of putting a high reward-to-risk ratio sounds good, but think about how it applies in actual trade scenarios.</p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s say you are a scalper and you only wish to risk 3 pips.</p>
    <p>Using a 3:1 reward to risk ratio, means you need to get 9 pips. Right off the bat, the odds are against you because you have to pay the spread.</p>
    <p>If your broker offered a 2 pip spread on EUR/USD, you&rsquo;ll have to gain 11 pips instead, forcing you to take a difficult 4:1 reward to risk ratio.</p>
    <p>Considering the exchange rate of EUR/USD could move 3 pips up and down within a few seconds, you would be stopped out faster than you can say &ldquo;Uncle!&rdquo;</p>
    <p>If you were to reduce your&nbsp;position size, then you could widen your stop to maintain your desired reward/risk ratio.</p>
    <p>Now, if you increased the pips you wanted to risk to 50, you would need to gain 153 pips.</p>
    <p>By doing this, you are able to bring your reward-to-risk ratio somewhere nearer to your desired 3:1. Not so bad anymore, right?</p>
    <p>In the real world, reward-to-risk ratios aren&rsquo;t set in stone. They must be adjusted depending on the time frame, trading environment, and your entry/exit points.</p>
    <p>A position trade could have a reward-to-risk ratio as high as 10:1 while a scalper could go for as little as 0.7:1.</p>
