    <p>Traders are often so fixated on their winning trades that they totally ignore their losing trades.</p>
    <p>But it&rsquo;s from your&nbsp;<strong>losing trades from&nbsp;which you stand to learn the most</strong>.</p>
    <p>Here are three ways to learn&nbsp;from the trades that didn&rsquo;t work out.</p>
    <h2>1. Calculate your performance</h2>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2020/06/03210408/calculate-profits-and-losses-150x150.png" />Look up your past trade transactions. If you can&rsquo;t find them, ask your broker for help.</p>
    <p>Gather your profit and loss data so you can&nbsp;begin to analyze the factors affecting your overall performance.</p>
    <p>Now, find your&nbsp;<strong>Average Gain</strong>:</p>
    <pre><strong>Average Gain</strong> = Total Gain / # of Profitable trades</pre>
    <p>Next, find your&nbsp;<strong>Average Loss</strong>:</p>
    <pre><strong>Average Loss </strong>= Total Loss / # of Unprofitable trades</pre>
    <p>Once you have both numbers, let&rsquo;s display it as a ratio so you can dig deeper into where your profits&nbsp;and losses are coming from:</p>
    <pre><strong>Profit/Loss Ratio</strong> = Average Gain / Average Loss</pre>
    <p>For example, let&rsquo;s say you had 10 profitable trades with an average $200 gain per trade and 5 unprofitable trades with an&nbsp;average $300 loss per trade:</p>
    <pre><strong>Profit/Loss Ratio</strong> = $200 / $300
    <strong>Profit/Loss Ratio</strong> = 0.67</pre>
    <p>A profit/loss ratio refers to the size of the average profit compared to the size of the average loss per trade.</p>
    <p>In the above example, since your average gain is $200 and your average loss is $300, your profit/loss ratio is 0.67.</p>
    <p>This means that your average profit is only 67% of your average loss.</p>
    <p>Said differently,&nbsp;<strong>you lost 1.5 times more money than you gained</strong>&nbsp;($300 average loss vs. $200 average gain).</p>
    <p>Fortunately,&nbsp;<strong>you won 10 trades out of 15</strong>.</p>
    <p>Your win percentage was&nbsp;<strong>67%</strong>.</p>
    <pre><strong>Win %</strong> = # of Profitable trades / Total trades
    <strong>Win %</strong> = 10 / 15
    <strong>Win %</strong> = 0.67 or 67%</pre>
    <p>The average gain versus the average loss per trade also tells&nbsp;you how well&nbsp;<strong>you&rsquo;re managing and closing out your&nbsp;positions.</strong></p>
    <p>If your average loss is more than your&nbsp;average gain, ask yourself:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Do I generally stick to my original trade plans&nbsp;or diverge from them?</li>
    <li>When my trades are profitable, what influences&nbsp;my decision to exit?</li>
    <li>When my trades are unprofitable, do I exit according to my preplanned risk management rules or hold on to losing trades too long?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By answering these questions, you can identify weaknesses and build better trading habits over time.</p>
    <h2>2. Drill down on your losers</h2>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2020/06/03210314/driller-machine-360x360.png" />If you want to learn from your past mistakes, you need to&nbsp;<strong>pay&nbsp;extra close attention to your average losses</strong>&nbsp;because you have the most&nbsp;control over them.</p>
    <p>Even when you do your homework, a position can move&nbsp;against you in a blink of an eye, turning a profitable trade&nbsp;into a loser.</p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s<strong>&nbsp;how you manage and control&nbsp;these situations</strong>&nbsp;that can make or&nbsp;break your success as a trader.</p>
    <p>If you found yourself in these situations in the past, sit back, and reflect on&nbsp;<em>how long</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>why</em>&nbsp;you allowed the position&nbsp;to fall before you acted.</p>
    <p>Focusing on your average losses&nbsp;will help you identify a bad habit in your trading approach that is probably contributing&nbsp;to mediocre results.</p>
    <p>Most likely, you&rsquo;re letting your losing trades run for too long. You probably need to cut them sooner.</p>
    <p>Try exiting a losing trade before it reaches your average loss. You may experience an&nbsp;immediate improvement in your performance.</p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s possible to be wrong more than you&rsquo;re right and still&nbsp;come out ahead.</p>
    <p>But your average gains need to be way bigger than your average losses.</p>
    <p>Basically, you may not be right often, but when you are, you are&nbsp;<em>really</em>&nbsp;right.</p>
    <p>The easiest way to track this by figuring your trade expectancy.</p>
    <h2>3. Calculate your trade expectancy</h2>
    <p><strong><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2020/06/03211001/expectancy-150x150.png" />Expectancy</strong>&nbsp;is the average dollar amount you expect to gain&nbsp;or lose per trade based on previous performance.</p>
    <p>It combines&nbsp;your percentage of profitable trades and average gain per&nbsp;trade with your percentage of losing trades and average loss&nbsp;per trade:</p>
    <pre><strong>Expectancy</strong> = (% Winning trades x Average gain) - (% Losing trades x Average Loss)</pre>
    <p>For example, let&rsquo;s say&nbsp;<strong>30%</strong>&nbsp;of your trades in the past three months were profitable and your average gain was<strong>&nbsp;$300</strong>&nbsp;per&nbsp;trade, while&nbsp;<strong>70%</strong>&nbsp;of your trades were unprofitable with an&nbsp;average loss per trade of<strong>&nbsp;$100</strong>.</p>
    <p>Based on the calculation above,&nbsp;you should expect an average gain of $20 per trade.</p>
    <pre><strong>Expectancy</strong> = (30% x $300) - (70% x $100)
    <strong>Expectancy</strong> = ($90) - ($70)
    <strong>Expectancy</strong> = $20</pre>
    <p>As you can see, expectancy basically refers to the average amount you can expect to win (or lose) per trade.</p>
    <p>You should aim for an increasingly positive expectancy with&nbsp;each trade.</p>
    <p>If the opposite is happening, revisit your losers&nbsp;to see where the breakdowns might be occurring.</p>
    <p>A lot of new traders are so obsessed with their profit/loss ratios that they are unaware that a bigger picture exists.</p>
    <p><strong>Your trading performance depends largely on your expectancy.</strong></p>
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>Examining your performance on a regular basis can&nbsp;help you better understand the behaviors and other factors&nbsp;that may be influencing your trading outcomes.</p>
    <p><strong>Paying close attention to losses</strong>&nbsp;is a great way to identify any shortcomings.</p>
