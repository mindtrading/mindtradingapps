    <p><strong>How much should you risk per trade?</strong></p>
    <p>Great question.</p>
    <p>Try to limit your risk to&nbsp;<strong>2% per trade</strong>.</p>
    <p>But that might even be a little high. Especially if you&rsquo;re a newbie forex trader.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/junior-help.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>Here is an important illustration that will show you the difference between risking a small percentage of your capital per trade compared to risking a higher percentage.</p>

    <p>You can see that there is a big difference between risking 2% of your account compared to risking 10% of your account on a single trade!</p>
    <p>If you happened to go through a losing streak and lost only 19 trades in a row, you would&rsquo;ve gone from starting with $20,000 to have only $3,002 left if you risked 10% on each trade.</p>
    <p>You would&rsquo;ve lost over&nbsp;<strong>85%</strong>&nbsp;of your account!</p>
    <p>If you risked only 2% you would&rsquo;ve still had $13,903 which is only a&nbsp;<strong>30%</strong>&nbsp;loss of your total account.</p>
    <p>Of course, the last thing we want to do is to lose 19 trades in a row, but even if you only lost 5 trades in a row, look at the difference between risking 2% and 10%.</p>
    <p>If you risked 2% you would still have $18,447.</p>
    <p>If you risked 10% you would only have $13,122.</p>
    <p>That&rsquo;s less than what you would&rsquo;ve had even if you lost all 19 trades and risked only 2% of your account!</p>
    <p>The point of this illustration is that you want to set up your risk&nbsp;management rules so that when you do have a&nbsp;drawdown&nbsp;period, you will still have enough capital to stay in the game.</p>
    <p>Can you imagine if you lost 85% of your account?!!</p>
    <p>You would have to make 566% on what you are left with in order to get back to breakeven!</p>
    <p>Trust us, you do NOT want to be in that position.</p>
    <h2>&ldquo;What Do I Have to Do to Get Back to Breakeven?&rdquo;</h2>
    <p>Here is a table that will illustrate what percentage you would have to make to break even if you were to lose a certain percentage of your account.</p>

    <p>You can see that the more you lose, the harder it is to make it back to your original account size.</p>
    <p>This is all the more reason that you should do everything you can to PROTECT your account.</p>
    <h2>Not sure how well (or poorly) your trade went?</h2>
    <p>Use our Gain &amp; Loss Percentage Calculator to help you know what percentage of the account balance you have won or lost.</p>
    <p>It also estimates a percentage of current balance required to get to the breakeven point again.</p>

    <p>By now, we hope you have gotten it drilled into your head that you should only risk a small percentage of your account per&nbsp;trade so that you can survive your losing streaks and also avoid a large drawdown in your account.</p>
    <p>Remember, you want to be the casino&hellip; NOT the gambler!</p>
