    <p>Now that you know how to set proper stops and calculate the correct position size, here&rsquo;s a lesson on how you can get a little creative in your trading.</p>
    <p>For those trading&nbsp;<strong>multiple position sizes</strong>, you can get really flexible and creative on how you manage your risk by &ldquo;<strong>scaling</strong>&rdquo; in and out of your positions.</p>
    <h2>What is Scaling?</h2>
    <p>What is &ldquo;scaling&rdquo; and why would you use it?</p>
    <p>Scaling in doesn&rsquo;t mean weighing yourself before, during, and after a trade (although it doesn&rsquo;t hurt to monitor that too!).</p>
    <p><strong>Scaling basically means adding or removing units from your original open position.</strong></p>
    <p>Scaling can help you to adjust your overall risk, lock in profits, or maximize your profit potential.</p>
    <p>Of course, when you add or remove from your position, there are potential downsides to be aware of as well.</p>
    <p>In the following lessons, we&rsquo;ll teach you all about the benefits and drawbacks of scaling in and out of trades.</p>
    <p>We&rsquo;ll teach you the&nbsp;<strong>CORRECT</strong>&nbsp;way to do this so that you don&rsquo;t go crazy because you took on too much risk and blew out your account.</p>
    <h2>Benefits of Scaling</h2>
    <p>The&nbsp;biggest benefit is a psychological one.</p>
    <p>Scaling in and out of your position takes away the need to be absolutely perfect in your entry or exit.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/senior-scaling.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>No one can consistently predict price action or the exact turning point of a market.</p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s way too difficult to keep expecting to get the best entry possible all the time. You are setting yourself up for a lot of heartaches.</p>
    <p>The best we can do is identify an &ldquo;area&rdquo; of potential support/resistance, reversal, momentum change, breakout, etc.</p>
    <p>You can&nbsp;<strong>enter your position in bits and pieces</strong>&nbsp;around those areas and/or take your trade off at different levels to lock in profits.</p>
    <p>How much easier would it be on you psychologically if you didn&rsquo;t have to accurately pinpoint exactly where to get in or out of the market? A lot easier right?!</p>
    <p>Plus you don&rsquo;t have to be accurate as a sniper and catch a move from its inflection point (ooohhh, big word!) to grab some pips!</p>
    <p>It also takes a lot of weight off of your shoulders anytime you can reduce risk, right? How about locking in profits?</p>
    <p>Properly executed with a trailing stop,&nbsp;<strong>scaling out of winning positions can help you protect your profits</strong>&nbsp;just in case the price suddenly reverses.</p>
    <p>Finally, if you add more to your open position, and the market continues to go your way, your bigger position size will increase the amount you will make for every pip.</p>
    <h2>Drawbacks of Scaling</h2>
    <p>The major drawback of scaling is when you add more to your position. Can anyone guess what that drawback is?</p>
    <p>You got it&hellip;YOU INCREASE YOUR OVERALL RISK!!</p>
    <p>Remember, traders are &ldquo;risk managers&rdquo; first, and if done incorrectly, &ldquo;scaling in&rdquo; can wipe out your account!!</p>
    <p>Lucky for you, we&rsquo;ll explain how to SAFELY add to an open position.</p>
    <p>The second drawback is when you remove portions of your open position, you reduce your max potential profit. Who wants to do that?</p>
    <p>Well, in markets as fast and dynamic as the foreign exchange market, it may benefit you to reduce your risk and &ldquo;take some off the table.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>In the next few sections, we will go through some basic examples of the BabyPips.com way to scale in or out of a trade.</p>
