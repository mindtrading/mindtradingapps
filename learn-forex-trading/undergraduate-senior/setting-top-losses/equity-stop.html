    <p>Let&rsquo;s start off with the most basic type of stop: the&nbsp;<strong>percentage-based stop loss</strong>.</p>
    <p>The&nbsp;percentage-based stop uses a&nbsp;<strong>predetermined portion of the trader&rsquo;s account.&nbsp;</strong></p>
    <p>For example, &ldquo;<em>2% of the account</em>&rdquo; is what a trader is willing to risk on a trade.</p>
    <p>The percentage risk can vary from trader to trader. More aggressive ones risk up to 10% of their account while less aggressive ones usually have less than 1% risk per trade.</p>
    <p>Once the percentage risk is determined, the forex trader uses his position size to compute how far he should set his stop away from his entry.</p>
    <p>This is good right?</p>
    <p>A trader is putting a stop, which is in accordance with his trading plan.</p>
    <p>This is good trading, right?</p>
    <p><strong>WRONG!!!</strong></p>
    <p><strong>You should always set your stop according to the market environment or your system rules, NOT how much you want to lose.</strong></p>
    <p>We bet you&rsquo;re thinking right now, &ldquo;Huh? That doesn&rsquo;t make any sense. I thought you said that we need to manage risk.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>We agree that this sounds confusing, but let us explain with an example. You remember Newbie Ned from your Position Sizing lesson, don&rsquo;t you?</p>
    <p>Newbie Ned has a mini account with $500 and the minimum size he can trade is 10k units. Newbie Ned decides to trade GBP/USD, as he sees that resistance at 1.5620 has been holding.</p>
    <p>As per his risk management rules, Ned will risk no more than 2% of his account per trade.</p>
    <p>At 10k units of GBP/USD, each pip is worth $1 and&nbsp;<strong>2% of his account is $10</strong>.</p>
    <p>The largest stop Ned can put on is&nbsp;<strong>10 pips</strong>, which is what he does on this trade by putting his stop at&nbsp;<strong>1.5630</strong>.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/senior-10-pip-stop-start.png"  /></p>
    <p>But GBP/USD moves over 100 pips a day! He could easily get stopped out at the smallest move of GBP/USD.</p>
    <p>Because of the position limits his account is set to, he is&nbsp;<strong>basing his stop solely on how much he wants to lose instead of the given market conditions</strong>&nbsp;of GBP/USD.</p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s see what happens next.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/senior-10-pip-stop-end.png"  /></p>
    <p>And bam! Ned got stopped out right at the TOP because his stop loss was too tight! And aside from losing this trade, he missed out on a chance to grab over 100 pips!</p>
    <p>From that example, you can see that the danger with using percentage&nbsp;stops is that it forces the forex trader to set his stop at an&nbsp;<strong>arbitrary price level</strong>.</p>
    <p>Either that stop will be located too close to the entry, like in Newbie Ned&rsquo;s case, or at a price level that doesn&rsquo;t take technical analysis into account.</p>
    <p>For all you know, you could be setting your stop right at that level where the price could turn and head your way (who hasn&rsquo;t seen that before?).</p>
    <p>But because you already got stopped out, you wouldn&rsquo;t be able to bag those pips! Darn it!</p>
    <p>The solution for Ned is to find a broker that suits his trading style and starting capital.</p>
    <p>In this case, Ned should trade with a forex broker that allows him to trade&nbsp;<strong>micro or even custom lots</strong>.</p>
    <p>At 1k of GBP/USD, each pip is worth $0.10.</p>
    <p>In order for Ned to stay within his risk comfort level, he could set a stop on GBP/USD to&nbsp;<strong>100 pips before losing 2% of his account</strong>.</p>
    <p>The math: 100 pips x $0.10 = $10.</p>
    <p>He now has the ability to set his stop to the market environment, trading system, support &amp; resistance, etc.</p>
