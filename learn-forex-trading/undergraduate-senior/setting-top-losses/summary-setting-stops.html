    <p>Well, there you have it&hellip; our awesome primer to setting stop losses.</p>
    <p>Now let&rsquo;s review the things you need to remember about stop losses.</p>
    <p><strong>Find a broker</strong>&nbsp;that allows you to trade position sizes that suits the size of your capital and risk management rules.</p>
    <p>We use the word &ldquo;predetermined&rdquo; a lot in this lesson because you should&nbsp;<strong>ALWAYS know when to get out before you open a position</strong>.</p>

    <p>Once you are already in a trade and it&rsquo;s turned into a loser, you lose the ability to make a decision to exit the trade with a clear head. That could be very bad for your account balance!</p>
    <p>Set stops to the current market environment, framework, or trading method.</p>
    <p><strong>Do not set your exit levels to how much you are willing to lose</strong>.</p>
    <p>The market does not know how much you have or how much you&rsquo;re willing to lose. Quite frankly, it doesn&rsquo;t care.</p>
    <p>Find the stop levels that&nbsp;<strong>prove your trade wrong</strong>&nbsp;first and then manage your position size according to it.</p>
    <p>This is worth repeating&hellip;</p>

    <p><strong>Use limit orders</strong>&nbsp;to close out your trade. Mental stops should only be used by those with a bazillion trades recorded in their journal.</p>
    <p>Even then, limit orders are still the way to go: emotionally unbiased and can be automatically executed while you are taking in some sun on the beach and sipping on virgin margaritas.</p>
    <p><strong>Only move your stop in the direction of your profit target</strong>. Trailing stops are good, widening stops are very, very bad!</p>
    <p>Like anything else in trading, setting stop losses is a science and an art.</p>
    <p>Markets are dynamic, volatility is well&hellip; volatile, and a rule or condition that works today may not work tomorrow.</p>
    <p>If you continually practice the correct way to set stops, record, and review your thought processes and trade outcomes in your journal, then you&rsquo;ll be one step closer to becoming a professional risk manager!</p>
