    <p>Let&rsquo;s talk about the four biggest mistakes traders make when using stop losses.</p>
    <p>We always stress using proper risk management but when used incorrectly, it could lead to more losses than wins. And you don&rsquo;t want that, do ya?</p>
    <h2>1. Placing stops too dang tight.</h2>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/senior-tight.png" />The first common mistake is placing stops tighter than those leather pants that Big Pippin used to wear back in the retro days.</p>
    <p>They&rsquo;re so tight that there ain&rsquo;t no room to breathe!</p>
    <p>In placing ultra-tight stops on trades, there won&rsquo;t be enough &ldquo;breathing room&rdquo; for the price to fluctuate before ultimately heading your way.</p>
    <p>Always remember to account for the&nbsp;<strong>pair&rsquo;s volatility</strong>&nbsp;and the fact that it could dilly-dally around your&nbsp;entry point&nbsp;for a bit before continuing in a particular direction.</p>
    <p>For example, let&rsquo;s say you went long GBP/JPY at 145.00 with a stop at 144.90.</p>
    <p>Even if you are right in predicting that the price would bounce from that area, it&rsquo;s a possibility that the price will still dip 10-15 pips lower than your entry price before popping higher, probably until 147.00.</p>
    <p>But guess what?</p>
    <p>You weren&rsquo;t able to rake in a 200-pip profit because you got stopped out in a jiffy. So don&rsquo;t forget:</p>
    <p>So don&rsquo;t forget: Give your trade&nbsp;<strong>enough breathing room</strong>&nbsp;and take volatility into account!</p>
    <h2>2. Using position size like &ldquo;X number of pips&rdquo; as a basis for stops.</h2>
    <p>Using position size like &ldquo;X number of pips&rdquo; or &ldquo;$X amount&rdquo; instead of technical analysis to determine stops&nbsp;is a BAD idea.</p>
    <p>We learned that from Newbie Ned, remember?</p>
    <p>Using position sizing to calculate how far your stop should be has&nbsp;<strong>nothing</strong>&nbsp;to do with how the market is behaving!.</p>
    <p>Since we&rsquo;re trading the market, it&rsquo;d make much more sense to set stops depending on how the market moves.</p>
    <p>After all, you picked your entry point and targets based on technical analysis so you should do the same for your stop.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/senior-setting-stops-mistakes.png" /></p>
    <p>We&rsquo;re not saying that you should forget about position size completely.</p>
    <p>What we&rsquo;re recommending is that&nbsp;<strong>you should decide where to place your stops first BEFORE calculating your position size.</strong></p>
    <h2>3. Placing stops too far or too wide.</h2>
    <p>Some traders make the mistake of setting stops way too far, crossing their fingers that price action will head their way sooner or later.</p>
    <p>Well, what&rsquo;s the point of setting stops then?</p>
    <p>What&rsquo;s the point of holding on to a trade that keeps losing and losing when you can use that money to enter a more profitable&nbsp;trade?</p>
    <p>Setting stops too far increases&nbsp;the amount of pips your trade needs to move in your favor to make the trade worth the risk.</p>
    <p>The general rule of thumb is to place stops<em>&nbsp;closer</em>&nbsp;to entry than profit targets.</p>
    <p>Of course, you&rsquo;d want to go for less risk and a bigger reward, right?</p>
    <p>With a good reward-to-risk ratio, say 2:1, you&rsquo;d be more likely to end up with profits if you&rsquo;re right on the money with your trades at least 50% of the time.</p>
    <h2>4. Placing stops&nbsp;<em>exactly</em>&nbsp;on support or resistance levels.</h2>
    <p>Setting stops too tight? Bad.</p>
    <p>Setting stops too far? Bad.</p>
    <p>Where exactly is a good stop placed then?</p>
    <p>Well, not exactly on support or resistance levels, we can tell&nbsp;you that.</p>
    <p>How come?</p>
    <p>Didn&rsquo;t we just say that technical analysis is the way to go when determining stops?</p>
    <p>Sure, it&rsquo;s helpful to note nearby support and resistance levels when deciding where to place stops.</p>
    <p>If you&rsquo;re going&nbsp;<strong>long</strong>, you can just look for a nearby support level below your entry and set your stop in that area.</p>
    <p>If you&rsquo;re going&nbsp;<strong>short</strong>, you can find out where the next resistance level above your entry is and put your stop around there.</p>
    <p>But why isn&rsquo;t it a good idea to put it right smack on the support or resistance level?</p>
    <p>The reason is that the price could still have a chance to turn and head your direction upon reaching that level.</p>
    <p>If you place your stop a few pips beyond that area then you&rsquo;d be more or less sure that the support or resistance is already broken and you can then acknowledge that your trade idea was wrong.</p>
