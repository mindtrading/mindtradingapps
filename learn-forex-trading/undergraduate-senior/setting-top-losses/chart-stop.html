    <p>The previous lesson discussed how to set stop loss using a percentage-based amount of your account.</p>
    <p>A more sensible way to determine stops would be to base it on&nbsp;<strong>what the charts are saying</strong>.</p>
    <p>Since we&rsquo;re trading the markets, we might as well base our stops on what the markets are showing us&hellip; Makes sense, right?</p>
    <p>One of the things that we can observe in price action is that there are times when prices can&rsquo;t seem to push or break beyond certain levels.</p>
    <p>Oftentimes, when these areas of support or resistance are retested, they could potentially hold the market from pushing through once again.</p>
    <p>Setting stops beyond these levels of support and resistance makes sense, because if the market does trade beyond these areas, then it is reasonable to think that a break of that area will bring in more traders to play the break and further push your position against you.</p>
    <p>Or, if these levels&nbsp;<strong>DO</strong>&nbsp;break, then there may be forces that you are unaware of suddenly pushing the market one way or another.</p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s take a quick look at a way to set your stops based on support and resistance:</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/senior-trend-line-break-example.png" /></p>
    <p>On the chart above, we can see that the pair is now trading above the falling trend line.</p>
    <p>You decide that this is a great breakout trade setup and you decide to go long.</p>
    <p>But before you enter your trade, ask yourself the following questions:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Where could you possibly set your stop?</li>
    <li>What conditions would tell you when your original trade idea is invalidated?</li>
    </ol>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/senior-trend-line-break-show-stops.png" /></p>
    <p>In this case, it makes the most sense to set your stops below the trend lines and support areas.</p>
    <p>If the market moves into these areas, that means the trend lines drew no support from buyers and now sellers are in control.</p>
    <p>Your trade idea was invalidated and it&rsquo;s time you to suck it up, exit the trade, and accept the loss.</p>
    <h2>Example: Short EUR/USD</h2>
    <p>In the chart below, the EUR/USD has been trending down. Price has hit the falling trendline a couple of times which makes for a nice resistance level.</p>
    <p>You could place a short order right at the downtrend line (1.3690).</p>
    <p>Now, where would you place your stop loss?</p>
    <p>Your&nbsp;<strong>stop loss</strong>&nbsp;would be placed at 1.3800.</p>
    <p>Notice how this is above the resistance area: the falling trendline.</p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s set profit targets at 1.3530 and 1.3450.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2010/07/eurusd-stop-loss-trendline.png" /></p>
    <p>The trade is triggered. The trendline holds as resistance and price falls.</p>
    <p>Your first profit target is hit.</p>
    <p>The second profit target is missed by a single pip but by that time, you had moved your stop loss to breakeven (where you entered short) so you lost nothing.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2010/07/eurusd-stop-loss-trendline-result.png" /></p>
    <p>This is an example of using resistance as a guide on where to place your stop instead of simply using a fixed number.</p>
