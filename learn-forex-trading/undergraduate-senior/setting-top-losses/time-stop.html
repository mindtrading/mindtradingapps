    <p>Time stops are stops you set based on a&nbsp;<strong>predetermined time in a trade</strong>.</p>
    <p>It could be a set time (open limit time of hours, days, weeks, etc.), only trade during specific trading sessions, the market&rsquo;s open or active hours, etc.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/senior-time-stop-bored.png" /></p>
    <p>For instance, let&rsquo;s say you are an intraday trader and you&rsquo;ve just put on a long trade on EUR/CHF and it hasn&rsquo;t gone anywhere.</p>
    <p>We&rsquo;re talking real snoozeville here!</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/senior-time-stop-yawn.png" /></p>
    <p>Why keep your money locked up in this trade when you can use it to take advantage of this one&hellip;</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/senior-more-movement.png" /></p>
    <p>More movement, more pips! Yeah, baby!</p>
    <p>Because of your predetermined rules and the fact you do not like to hold trades overnight you have decided to close the position at 4:00 pm when you&rsquo;re usually done for the day, and go off to your bi-weekly poker&nbsp;tournament.</p>
    <p>Or maybe you are a swing trader and you decided to close your positions on Friday to&nbsp;<strong>avoid gaps and weekend event risk</strong>.</p>
    <p>Also, having some margin tied up in a dead trade could be costing you an opportunity in another great trade setup somewhere else.</p>
    <p>Set a time limit and cut off that dead weight so that money can do what it is meant to do&hellip; Make more money!</p>
