    <p>While the&nbsp;<strong>Fibonacci retracement tool</strong>&nbsp;is extremely useful, it shouldn&rsquo;t be used all by its lonesome self.</p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s kinda like comparing it to NBA legend&nbsp;Kobe Bryant.</p>
    <p>Kobe was one of the greatest basketball players of all time, but even he couldn&rsquo;t win those titles by himself.</p>
    <p>He needed some backup.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2011/02/kobe-bryant.jpg" alt="" /></p>
    <p>Similarly, the Fibonacci retracement tool should be used in combination with other tools.</p>
    <p>In this lesson, let&rsquo;s take what you&rsquo;ve learned so far and try to combine them to help us spot some sweet trade setups.</p>
    <p>Are y&rsquo;all ready? Let&rsquo;s get this pip show on the road!</p>
    <h2>Fibonacci Retracement + Support and Resistance</h2>
    <p>One of the best ways to use the Fibonacci retracement tool is to spot potential support and resistance levels and see if they line up with Fibonacci retracement levels.</p>
    <p>If Fibonacci levels are already support and resistance levels, and you combine them with other price areas that a lot of other traders are watching, then the chances of price bouncing from those areas are much higher.</p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s look at an example of how you can combine support and resistance levels with Fibonacci levels. Below is a daily chart of USD/CHF.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade3-fibonacci-support-resistance.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>As you can see, it&rsquo;s been on an uptrend recently. Look at all those green candles!</p>
    <p>You decide that you want to get in on this long USD/CHF bandwagon.</p>
    <p>But the question is, &ldquo;When do you enter?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>You bust out the Fibonacci retracement tool, using the low at&nbsp;<strong>1.0132</strong>&nbsp;on January 11 for the Swing Low and the high at&nbsp;<strong>1.0899</strong>&nbsp;on February 19 for the Swing High.</p>
    <p>Now your chart looks pretty sweet with all those Fibonacci retracement levels.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade3-fibonacci-support-resistance-start-thumbnail.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>Now that we have a framework to increase our probability of finding a solid entry, we can answer the question &ldquo;Where should you enter?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>You look back a little bit and you see that the 1.0510 price was good resistance level in the past and it just happens to line up with the&nbsp;<strong>50.0%</strong>&nbsp;Fibonacci retracement level.</p>
    <p>Now that it&rsquo;s broken, it could turn into support and be a good place to buy.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade3-fibonacci-support-resistance-end-thumbnail.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>If you did set an order somewhere around the 50.0% Fib level, you&rsquo;d be a pretty happy camper!</p>
    <p>There would have been some pretty tense moments, especially on the second test of the support level on April 1.</p>
    <p>Price tried to pierce through the support level but&nbsp;<strong>failed to close below it</strong>. Eventually, the pair broke past the Swing High and resumed its uptrend.</p>
    <p>You can do the same setup on a downtrend as well. The point is you should look for price levels that seem to have been areas of interest in the past.</p>
    <p>If you think about it, there&rsquo;s a higher chance that the price will bounce from these levels.</p>
    <p>Why?</p>
    <p>First, as we discussed in&nbsp;Grade 1, previous support or resistance levels are usually good areas to buy or sell because other traders will also be eyeing these levels like a hawk.</p>
    <p>Second, since we know that a lot of traders also use the Fibonacci retracement tool, they may be looking to jump in on these Fib levels themselves.</p>
    <p><strong>With traders looking at the same support and resistance levels, there&rsquo;s a good chance that there are a ton of orders at those price levels.</strong></p>
    <p>While there&rsquo;s no guarantee that the price will bounce from those levels, at least you can be more confident about your trade. After all, there is strength in numbers!</p>
    <p>Remember that trading is all about&nbsp;<strong>probabilities</strong>.</p>
    <p>If you stick to those higher probability trades, then there&rsquo;s a better chance of coming out ahead in the long run.</p>
