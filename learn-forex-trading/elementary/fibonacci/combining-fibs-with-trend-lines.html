    <p>Another good tool to combine with the Fibonacci retracement tool is trend line analysis.</p>
    <p>After all, Fibonacci retracement levels work best when the market is trending, so this makes a lot of sense!</p>
    <p>Remember that whenever a pair is in a downtrend or uptrend, traders use Fibonacci retracement levels as a way to get in on the trend.</p>
    <p>So why not look for levels where Fib levels line up right smack with the trend?</p>
    <p>Here&rsquo;s a 1-hour chart of AUD/JPY. As you can see, the price has been respecting a short-term ascending trend line&nbsp;over the past couple of days.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade3-fibonacci-trendline.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>You think to yourself, &ldquo;Hmm, that&rsquo;s a sweet uptrend right there. I wanna buy&nbsp;AUD/JPY, even if it&rsquo;s just for a short-term trade. I think I&rsquo;ll buy once the pair hits the trend line again.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Before you do that though, why don&rsquo;t you reach for your forex toolbox and get that Fibonacci retracement tool out? Let&rsquo;s see if we can get a more exact entry price.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade3-fibonacci-trendline-start.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>Here we plotted the Fibonacci retracement levels by using the Swing low at 82.61 and the Swing High at 83.84.</p>
    <p>Notice how the 50.0% and 61.8% Fib levels are intersected by the rising trend line.</p>
    <p>Could these levels serve as potential support levels? There&rsquo;s only one way to find out!</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade3-fibonacci-trendline-end.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>Guess what? The 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level held, as price bounced there before heading back up. If you had set some orders at that level, you would have had a perfect entry!</p>
    <p>A couple of hours after touching the trend line, price zoomed up like Astro Boy&nbsp;bursting through the Swing High.</p>
    <p>Aren&rsquo;t you glad you&rsquo;ve got this in your trading&nbsp;toolbox now?</p>
    <p>As you can see, it does pay to make use of the Fibonacci retracement tool, even if you&rsquo;re planning to enter on a retest of the trend line.</p>
    <p>The combination of both a diagonal and a horizontal support or resistance&nbsp;level could mean that other traders are eying those levels as well.</p>
    <p>Take note though, as with other drawing tools, drawing trend lines can also get pretty subjective.</p>
    <p>You don&rsquo;t know exactly how other traders are drawing them, but you can count on one thing &ndash; that there&rsquo;s a trend!</p>
    <p>If you see that an uptrend is developing, you should be looking for ways to go long to give you a better chance of a profitable trade.</p>
    <p>You can use the Fibonacci retracement tool to help you find potential entry points.</p>
