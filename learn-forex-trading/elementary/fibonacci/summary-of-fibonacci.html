    <p>Let&rsquo;s review what we&rsquo;ve learned about trading Fibonacci.</p>
    <p>The key Fibonacci retracement levels to keep an eye on are: 23.6%, 38.2%, 50.0%, 61.8%, and 76.4%.</p>
    <p>The levels that seem to hold the most weight are the&nbsp;<strong>38.2%, 50.0%, and 61.8% levels</strong>, which are normally set as the default settings of most forex charting software.</p>

    <p>Remember that forex traders view the&nbsp;<strong>Fibonacci retracement levels</strong>&nbsp;as potential support and resistance areas.</p>
    <p>And because these levels tend to be closely watched by many, many forex traders, the support and resistance levels may&nbsp;<strong>become a self-fulfilling prophecy</strong>.</p>

    <p>Similar to the retracement levels, the key Fibonacci extension levels are: 38.2%, 50.0%, 61.8%, as well as the 100%, 138.2% and 161.8% extensions.</p>
    <p>Traders use the&nbsp;<strong>Fibonacci extension levels</strong>&nbsp;as potential support and resistance areas to set&nbsp;<strong>profit targets</strong>.</p>
    <p>Again, since so many forex&nbsp;traders are watching these levels and placing buy and sell orders to&nbsp;<strong>take profits</strong>, these levels can often become the end of the trend move due to self-fulfilling expectations.</p>
    <p>In order to apply Fibonacci levels to your charts, you&rsquo;ll need to identify Swing High and Swing Low points.</p>
    <p>A<strong>&nbsp;Swing High</strong>&nbsp;is a candlestick with at least&nbsp;<strong>two lower highs</strong>&nbsp;on both the left and right of itself.</p>
    <p>A&nbsp;<strong>Swing Low</strong>&nbsp;is a candlestick with at least<strong>&nbsp;two higher lows</strong>&nbsp;on both the left and right of itself.</p>
    <p>When using Fibonacci tools, the probability of trading success could increase when used with other support and resistance levels, trend lines, and candlestick patterns&nbsp;for spotting entry and stop loss points.</p>
