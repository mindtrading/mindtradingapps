    <p>If you&rsquo;ve been paying attention in class, you&rsquo;d know by now that you can combine the Fibonacci retracement tool with support and resistance levels, and trend lines&nbsp;to create a simple but super awesome trading strategy.</p>
    <p>But we ain&rsquo;t done yet!</p>
    <p>In this lesson, we&rsquo;re going to teach you how to combine the Fibonacci retracement tool with your knowledge of Japanese candlestick patterns that you learned in Grade 2.</p>
    <p>When combining the Fibonacci retracement tool with candlestick patterns, we are actually looking for exhaustive candlesticks.</p>
    <p>If you can tell when buying or selling pressure is&nbsp;<strong>exhausted</strong>, it can give you a clue of when price may continue trending.</p>
    <p>We here at BabyPips.com like to call them &ldquo;Fibonacci Candlesticks,&rdquo; or &ldquo;<strong>Fib Sticks</strong>&rdquo; for short. Pretty catchy, eh? Let&rsquo;s take a look at an example to make this clearer.</p>
    <p>Below is a&nbsp;<strong>1-hour chart of EUR/USD</strong>.</p>
    <p><img title="1-hour chart of EUR/USD with Fibonacci retracement levels" src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade3-fibonacci-candlesticks.png" alt="1-hour chart of EUR/USD with Fibonacci retracement levels" width="525" height="298" border="0" /></p>
    <p>The pair seems to have been in a downtrend the past week, but the move seems to have paused for a bit.</p>
    <p>Will there be a chance to get in on this downtrend? You know what this means. It&rsquo;s time to take the Fibonacci retracement tool and get to work!</p>
    <p>As you can see from the chart, we&rsquo;ve set our Swing High at 1.3364 on March 3, with the Swing Low at 1.2523 on March 6.</p>
    <p>Since it&rsquo;s a Friday, you decided to just chill out, take an early day off, and decide when you wanna enter once you see the charts after the weekend.</p>
    <p><img title="Bullish green candle. Is EUR/USD headed for new highs?" src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade3-fibonacci-candlesticks-green-candle.png" alt="Bullish green candle. Is EUR/USD headed for new highs?" width="525" height="298" border="0" /></p>
    <p>Whoa! By the time you popped open your charts, you see that EUR/USD has shot up quite a bit from its Friday closing price.</p>
    <p>While the 50.0% Fib level held for a bit, buyers eventually took the pair higher. You decide to wait and see whether the 61.8% Fib level holds.</p>
    <p>After all, the last candle was pretty bullish! Who knows, the price just might keep shooting up!</p>
    <p><img title="Doji forms on the 61.8% Fib. Potential reversal?" src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade3-fibonacci-candlesticks-doji.png" alt="Doji forms on the 61.8% Fib. Potential reversal" width="525" height="285" border="0" /></p>
    <p>Well, will you look at that? A long-legged doji has formed right smack on the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level.</p>
    <p>If you paid attention in Grade 2, you&rsquo;d know that this is an &ldquo;exhaustive candle.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Has buying pressure died down? Is resistance at the Fibonacci retracement level holding?</p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s possible. Other traders were probably eyeing that Fib level as well.</p>
    <p>Is it time to short? You can never know for sure (which is why risk management is so important), but the probability of a reversal looks pretty darn good!</p>
    <p><img title="Buyers ran out of steam. Resistance at 61.8% Fibonacci retracement held" src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade3-fibonacci-candlesticks-end.png" alt="Buyers ran out of steam. Resistance at 61.8% Fibonacci retracement held" width="525" height="285" border="0" /></p>
    <p>If you had shorted right after that doji had formed, you could have made some serious profits.</p>
    <p>Right after the doji, the price stalled for a bit before heading straight down. Take a look at all those red candles!</p>
    <p>It seems that buyers were indeed pretty tired, which allowed sellers to jump back in and take control.</p>
    <p>Eventually, the price went all the way back down to the Swing Low. That was a move of about 500 pips! That could&rsquo;ve been your trade of the year!</p>
    <p>Looking for &ldquo;Fib Sticks&rdquo; can be really useful, as they can signal whether a Fibonacci retracement level will hold.</p>
    <p>If it seems that price is stalling on a Fib level, chances are that other traders may have put some orders at those levels.</p>
    <p>This would act as more confirmation that there is indeed some resistance or support at that price.</p>
    <p>Another nice thing about Fib Sticks is that you don&rsquo;t need to place limit orders at the Fib levels.</p>
    <p>You may have some concerns about whether the support or resistance will hold since we are looking at a &ldquo;zone&rdquo; and not necessarily specific levels.</p>
    <p>This is where you can use your knowledge of candlestick formations.</p>
    <p>You could wait for a Fib Stick to form right below or above a Fibonacci retracement level to give you more confirmation on whether you should put in an order.</p>
    <p>If a Fib stick does form, you can just enter a trade at the market price since you now have more confirmation that level could be holding.</p>
