    <p>We will be using&nbsp;<strong>Fibonacci ratios</strong>&nbsp;a lot in our trading so you better learn it and love it like your mother&rsquo;s home cooking.</p>
    <p>Fibonacci is a huge subject and there are many different Fibonacci studies with weird-sounding names but we&rsquo;re going to stick to two:&nbsp;<strong>retracement</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>extension</strong>.</p>
    <p>Let us first start by introducing you to the Fib man himself&hellip;Leonardo Fibonacci.</p>
    <p><img title="Fibonacci" src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade3-nerd.png" /></p>
    <p>No, Leonardo Fibonacci isn&rsquo;t some famous chef. Actually, he was a famous Italian mathematician, also known as a super-duper uber ultra geek.</p>
    <p>He had an &ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; moment when he discovered a simple series of numbers that created ratios describing the natural proportions of things in the universe.</p>
    <p>The ratios arise from the following number series: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144&hellip;</p>
    <p>This series of numbers is derived by starting with 0 followed by 1 and then adding 0 + 1 to get 1, the third number.</p>
    <p>Then, adding the second and third numbers (1 + 1) to get 2, the fourth number, and so on.</p>
    <p>After the first few numbers in the sequence, if you measure the&nbsp;<strong>ratio</strong>&nbsp;of any number to the succeeding higher number, you get&nbsp;<strong>.618</strong>.</p>
    <p>For example, 34 divided by 55 equals .618.</p>
    <p>If you measure the ratio between alternate numbers you get&nbsp;<strong>.382</strong>.</p>
    <p>For example, 34 divided by 89 = 0.382 .</p>
    <p>You have now just experienced the Fibonacci Sequence!</p>

    <h2><strong>Fibonacci Sequence</strong></h2>
    <p>A&nbsp;<strong>Fibonacci sequence</strong>&nbsp;is formed by taking 2 numbers, any 2 numbers, and adding them together to form a third number.</p>
    <p>Then the second and third numbers are added again to form the fourth number.</p>
    <p>And you can continue this until it&rsquo;s not fun anymore.</p>
    <p>The ratio of the last number over the second-to-the-last number is approximately equal to<strong>&nbsp;1.618</strong>.</p>
    <p>This ratio can be found in many natural objects, so this ratio is called the&nbsp;<strong>golden ratio</strong>.</p>
    <p>It appears many times in geometry, art, architecture, and even on Sonic the Hedgehog.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2011/02/21220917/golden-ratio.png" /></p>
    <p>The golden ratio is actually an irrational number, like pi, and is often denoted by the Greek letter,&nbsp;<strong>phi</strong>&nbsp;(<strong>&phi;</strong>).</p>
    <p>Okay, that&rsquo;s enough mumbo jumbo.</p>
    <p>With all those numbers, you could put an elephant to sleep. We&rsquo;ll just cut to the chase; these are the ratios you HAVE to know:</p>
    <h2>Fibonacci Retracement Levels</h2>
    <p>0.236, 0.382, 0.618, 0.764</p>
    <h2>Fibonacci Extension Levels</h2>
    <p>0, 0.382, 0.618, 1.000, 1.382, 1.618</p>
    <p>You won&rsquo;t really need to know how to calculate all of this. Your charting software will do all the work for you.</p>
    <p>However, it&rsquo;s always good to be familiar with the basic theory behind the indicator so you&rsquo;ll have the knowledge to impress your date.</p>
    <p>Fibonacci retracement levels work on the theory that after a big price moves in one direction, the price will&nbsp;<em>retrace</em>&nbsp;or return partway back to a previous price level before resuming in the original direction.</p>
    <p>Traders use the Fibonacci retracement levels as potential&nbsp;<strong>support and resistance areas</strong>.</p>
    <p>Since so many traders watch these same levels and place buy and sell orders on them to enter trades or place stops, the support and resistance levels tend to become a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>
    <p>Traders use the Fibonacci extension levels as&nbsp;<strong>profit-taking levels</strong>.</p>
    <p>Again, since so many traders are watching these levels to place buy and sell orders to take profits, this tool tends to work more often than not due to self-fulfilling expectations.</p>
    <p>Most charting software includes both Fibonacci retracement levels and extension level tools.</p>
    <p>In order to apply Fibonacci levels to your charts, you&rsquo;ll need to identify Swing High and Swing Low points.</p>
    <p>A&nbsp;<strong>Swing High</strong>&nbsp;is a candlestick with at least&nbsp;<em>two lower highs</em>&nbsp;on both the left and right of itself.</p>
    <p>A&nbsp;<strong>Swing Low</strong>&nbsp;is a candlestick with at least&nbsp;<em>two higher lows</em>&nbsp;on both the left and right of itself.</p>
    <p>You got all that? Don&rsquo;t worry, we&rsquo;ll explain retracements, extensions, and most importantly, how to grab some pips using the Fibonacci tool in the following&nbsp;lessons.</p>
