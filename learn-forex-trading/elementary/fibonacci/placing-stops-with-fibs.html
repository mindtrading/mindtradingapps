    <p>Probably just as important as knowing where to enter or take off profits is knowing&nbsp;<strong>where to place your stop loss</strong>.</p>
    <p>You can&rsquo;t just enter a trade based on Fib levels without having a clue where to exit.</p>
    <p>Your account will just go up in flames and you will forever blame Fibonacci, cursing his name in Italian.</p>
    <p>In this lesson, you&rsquo;ll learn a couple of techniques to set your stops when you decide to use them trusty Fib levels.</p>
    <p>These are simple ways to set your stop and the rationale behind each method.</p>
    <h2>Method #1: Place Stop Just Past Next Fib</h2>
    <p>The first method is to&nbsp;<strong>set your stop just past the next Fibonacci level.</strong></p>
    <p>If you were planning to enter at the 38.2% Fib level, then you would place your stop beyond the 50.0% level.</p>
    <p>If you felt like the 50.0% level would hold, then you&rsquo;d put your stop past the 61.8% level and so on and so forth. Simple, right?</p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s take another look at that 4-hour EUR/USD chart we showed you back in the Fibonacci retracement lesson.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade3-fibonacci-stop-level.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>If you had shorted at the 50.0%, you could have placed your stop loss order just past the 61.8% Fib level.</p>
    <p>The reasoning behind this method of setting stops is that you believed that the 50.0% level would hold as a resistance point. Therefore, if the price were to rise beyond this point, your trade idea would be invalidated.</p>
    <p>The problem with this method of setting stops is that it is entirely dependent on you having a perfect entry.</p>
    <p>Setting a stop just past the next Fibonacci retracement level assumes that&nbsp;<strong>you are really confident that the support or resistance area will hold</strong>. And, as we pointed out earlier, using drawing tools isn&rsquo;t an exact science.</p>
    <p>The market might shoot up, hit your stop, and eventually go in your direction. This is usually when we&rsquo;d go to a corner, and start hitting our head on the wall.</p>
    <p>We&rsquo;re just warning you that this might happen, sometimes a few times in a row, so make sure you limit your losses quickly and let your winners run with the trend.</p>
    <p>It might be best if you used this type of stop placement method for short-term, intraday trades.</p>
    <h2>Method #2: Place Stop Past Recent Swing High/Low</h2>
    <p>Now, if you want to be a little safer, another way to set your stops would be to&nbsp;<strong>place them past the recent Swing High or Swing Low</strong>.</p>
    <p>For example, when the price is an&nbsp;<em>uptrend</em>&nbsp;and you&rsquo;re in a long position, you can place a stop loss just below the latest&nbsp;<strong>Swing Low&nbsp;</strong>which acts as a potential&nbsp;<strong>support</strong>&nbsp;level.</p>
    <p>When the price is in a&nbsp;<em>downtrend</em>&nbsp;and you&rsquo;re in a short position, you can place a stop loss just above the&nbsp;<strong>Swing High</strong>&nbsp;which acts as a potential&nbsp;<strong>resistance</strong>&nbsp;level.</p>
    <p>This type of stop loss placement would give your trade more room to breathe and give you a better chance for the market to move in favor of your trade.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade3-fibonacci-stop-swing-high.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>If the market price were to surpass the Swing High or Swing Low, it may indicate that a reversal of the trend is already in place.</p>
    <p>This means that your trade idea or setup is already invalidated and that you&rsquo;re too late to jump in.</p>
    <p>Setting larger stop losses would probably be best used for longer-term, swing-type trades, and you can also incorporate this into a &ldquo;scaling in&rdquo;&nbsp;method, which you will learn later on in this course.</p>
    <p>Of course, with a larger stop, you also have to remember to adjust your position size accordingly.</p>
    <p>If you tend to trade the same position size, you may incur large losses, especially if you enter at one of the earlier Fib levels.</p>
    <p>This can also lead to some unfavorable reward-to-risk&nbsp;ratios, as you may have a wide stop that isn&rsquo;t proportional to your potential reward.</p>
    <h2>So which way is better?</h2>
    <p>The truth is, just like in combining the Fibonacci retracement tool with support and resistance, trend lines, and candlesticks to find a better entry, it would be best to use your knowledge of these tools to analyze the current environment to help you pick a good stop loss point.</p>
    <p>As much as possible, you shouldn&rsquo;t rely solely on Fibonacci levels as support and resistance points as the basis for stop loss placement.</p>
    <p>Remember, stop loss placement isn&rsquo;t a sure thing.</p>
    <p>But if you can&nbsp;<strong>tilt the odds in your favor</strong>&nbsp;by combining multiple tools, it could help give you a better exit point, more room for your trade to breathe, and possibly a better reward-to-risk ratio trade.</p>
