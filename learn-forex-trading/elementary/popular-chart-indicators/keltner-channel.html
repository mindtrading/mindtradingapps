    <p><strong>Keltner Channels</strong>&nbsp;is a volatility indicator introduced by a grain trader named Chester Keltner in his 1960 book, How To Make Money in Commodities.</p>
    <p>A revised version was later developed by Linda Raschke in the 1980s.</p>
    <p>Linda&rsquo;s version of the Keltner Channel, which is more widely used, is quite similar to Bollinger Bands in that it also consists of three lines.</p>
    <p>However, the middle line in a Keltner Channel is an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and the two outer lines are based on the Average True Range (ATR) rather than on standard deviations (SD).</p>
    <p>Because the channel is derived from the ATR, which is a volatility indicator itself, the Keltner Channel also contracts and expands with volatility but is not as volatile as the Bollinger Bands.</p>
    <p>Keltner Channels serve as a guide for setting trade entries and exits.</p>
    <p>The Keltner Channel help&nbsp;<strong>identify overbought and oversold levels</strong>&nbsp;relative to a moving average, especially when the&nbsp;<strong>trend is flat</strong>.</p>
    <p>It can also provide clues for new trends.</p>
    <p>Think of the channel like an ascending or descending channel, except it automatically adjust to recent volatility and isn&rsquo;t made up of straight lines.</p>

    <p>If you&rsquo;ve read our lesson on Bollinger Bands, you&rsquo;re probably guessing that Keltner Channels are basically cut from the same cloth. Well, almost.</p>
    <p>What sets these two apart are the underlying indicators and calculations that we could go on and on about&hellip; but might lull you to sleep.</p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s just say that these formulas yield differences in price sensitivity and the smoothness of the indicators.</p>
    <h2>How to Trade Forex Using Keltner Channels</h2>
    <p>Keltner Channels show the area where a currency pair normally hangs out.</p>
    <p>The&nbsp;<strong>channel top typically holds as dynamic&nbsp;<em>resistance</em></strong>&nbsp;while the&nbsp;<strong>channel bottom serves as a dynamic&nbsp;<em>support</em></strong>.</p>
    <h3>How to Use Keltner Channels as Dynamic Support and Resistance Levels</h3>
    <p>The most commonly used settings are&nbsp;<strong>2 x&nbsp;ATR (10)</strong>&nbsp;for the upper and lower lines and&nbsp;<strong>EMA (20)</strong>, which is the middle line.</p>
    <p>This middle line is pretty significant since it tends to act as a pullback level during ongoing trends.<a href="https://bpcdn.co/images/2019/05/15044919/a.png"><br /></a></p>
    <p>In an UPTREND, the price action tends to be confined in the UPPER HALF of the channel, which is between the middle line as support and the top line as resistance.</p>

    <p>In a DOWNTREND, price action usually hangs around the BOTTOM HALF of the channel, finding resistance at the middle line and support at the bottom line.</p>

    <p>In a RANGING MARKET, price usually swings back and forth between the top and bottom lines.</p>
    <h3>How to Trade Breakouts Using Keltner Channels</h3>
    <p>Breakouts from the Keltner Channel act as strong hints where the price is running off to next.</p>
    <p>If the candles start to break out above the TOP, then the move will usually continue to go UP.<img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2019/05/15045659/7-780x439.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>If the candles start to break below the BOTTOM, then the price will usually continue to go DOWN.</p>

    <p>Keeping an eye out for these channel breakouts can help you catch a big move as early as possible.</p>
