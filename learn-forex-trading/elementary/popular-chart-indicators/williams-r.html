    <p>The&nbsp;<strong>Williams Percent Range</strong>, also called&nbsp;<strong>Williams %R</strong>, is a momentum indicator that shows you&nbsp;<em>where the last closing price is relative to the highest and lowest prices</em>&nbsp;of a given time period.</p>
    <p>As an oscillator, Williams %R&nbsp;tells you when a currency pair might be &ldquo;<strong>overbought</strong>&rdquo; or &ldquo;<strong>oversold</strong>.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Think of it as a less popular and more sensitive version of Stochastic.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2019/05/16055138/Williams-780x439.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>As a momentum indicator, it also gives RSI-like vibes in that it measures the strength of a current trend.</p>
    <p>But while&nbsp;RSI&nbsp;uses its mid-point figure (50) to determine trend strength, traders use %R&rsquo;s extreme levels (<strong>-20</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>-80</strong>) for cues.</p>
    <h2>How to Trade Forex Using the Williams %R Indicator</h2>
    <p>Did you know that Stochastic and %R use the same formula to pinpoint the relative location of a currency pair?</p>
    <p>The only difference is that Stochastic shows you a relative location by using the&nbsp;<em>lowest price</em>&nbsp;in a time range while %R uses the&nbsp;<em>highest price</em>&nbsp;to pinpoint the closing price&rsquo;s position.</p>
    <p>In fact, if you invert the %R line, it will have the EXACT SAME LINE as Stochastic&rsquo;s %K line!</p>
    <p>This is why Williams %R uses the&nbsp;<strong>0 to -100</strong>&nbsp;scale while Stochastic is scaled from&nbsp;<strong>0 to 100.</strong></p>
    <p>A reading&nbsp;<strong>above -20&nbsp;</strong>is&nbsp;<strong>OVERBOUGHT</strong>.</p>
    <p>A reading<strong>&nbsp;below -80&nbsp;</strong>is&nbsp;<strong>OVERSOLD.</strong></p>
    <p>An overbought or oversold reading does NOT guarantee that the price will reverse.</p>
    <p>All &ldquo;overbought&rdquo; means the price is&nbsp;<strong>near the highs of its recent range.</strong></p>
    <p>The same goes for oversold. All &ldquo;oversold&rdquo; means the&nbsp;<strong>price is near the lows of its recent range.</strong></p>
    <h2>Determining Trend Strength Using %R</h2>
    <p>Williams %R&rsquo;s sensitivity to volatile prices comes in handy when you want to know if prices are maintaining their bullish or bearish momentum.</p>
    <p>In EUR/USD&rsquo;s daily chart below, you can see that the pair tried to extend its uptrend but failed to reach a new price and %R highs.</p>
    <p>This means that prices aren&rsquo;t hitting the high end of their range as quickly as they did before and that the bullish momentum might be running out of steam.</p>
    <p>In this case, the pair ended up dropping 200 pips in a week!</p>

    <p>Almost immediately after that, the price gained enough bullish momentum to push %R above its oversold levels.</p>
    <p>But although EUR/USD&nbsp;is still poppin&rsquo; up red candlesticks, they&rsquo;re not enough to drag Williams %R back to its previous lows.</p>
    <p>Another loss of momentum?</p>
    <p>Williams %R sure thought so!</p>
    <p>Turned out, the bulls DID take over and pushed EUR/USD around 775 pips higher in less than 30 days.</p>
    <p>Now that&rsquo;s good oscillating right there. No wonder superfans call Williams %R as &ldquo;The Ultimate Oscillator!&rdquo;</p>
