    <p>What is&nbsp;<strong>MACD</strong>?</p>
    <p>MACD is an acronym for&nbsp;<strong>M</strong>oving&nbsp;<strong>A</strong>verage&nbsp;<strong>C</strong>onvergence&nbsp;<strong>D</strong>ivergence.</p>
    <p>This technical indicator is a tool that&rsquo;s used to identify moving averages that are indicating a new trend, whether it&rsquo;s bullish or bearish.</p>
    <p>After all, a top priority in trading is being able to&nbsp;<strong>find a trend</strong>, because that is where the most money is made.</p>
    <p><img title="MACD" src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade5-MACD-histogram.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>With a MACD chart, you will usually see three numbers that are used for its settings.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>The first is the number of periods that are used to calculate the&nbsp;<strong>faster-moving average</strong>.</li>
    <li>The second is the number of periods that are used in the&nbsp;<strong>slower moving average</strong>.</li>
    <li>And the third is the number of bars that are used to calculate&nbsp;<strong>the moving average of the&nbsp;<em>difference</em>&nbsp;between the faster and slower moving averages</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For example, if you were to see &ldquo;<strong>12, 26, 9</strong>&rdquo; as the MACD parameters (which is usually the default setting for most charting software), this is how you would interpret it:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>The&nbsp;<strong>12</strong>&nbsp;represents a moving average of the previous 12 bars.</li>
    <li>The&nbsp;<strong>26</strong>&nbsp;represents a moving average of the previous 26 bars.</li>
    <li>The&nbsp;<strong>9</strong>&nbsp;represents a moving average of the&nbsp;<em>difference</em>&nbsp;between the two moving averages above.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>There is a common misconception when it comes to the lines of the MACD.</p>
    <p>There are two lines:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>The &ldquo;<strong>MACD Line</strong>&ldquo;</li>
    <li>The &ldquo;<strong>Signal Line</strong>&ldquo;</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The two lines that are drawn are NOT moving averages of the price.</p>
    <p>The&nbsp;<strong>MACD Line is the difference (or distance) between two moving averages</strong>. These two moving averages are usually exponential moving averages (EMAs).</p>
    <p>When looking at the indicator, the MACD Line is considered the &ldquo;faster&rdquo; moving average.</p>
    <p>In our example above, the MACD Line is the&nbsp;<em>difference</em>&nbsp;between the 12 and 26-period moving averages.</p>
    <p>The&nbsp;<strong>Signal Line is the&nbsp;<em>moving average</em>&nbsp;of the MACD Line.</strong></p>
    <p>When looking at the indicator, the Signal Line is considered the &ldquo;slower&rdquo; moving average.</p>
    <p>The slower moving average plots the average of the previous MACD Line. Once again, from our example above, this would be a 9-period moving average.</p>
    <p>Most charts use a 9-period exponential moving average (EMA) by default.</p>
    <p>This means that we are taking the average of the last 9 periods of the &ldquo;faster&rdquo; MACD Line and plotting it as our &ldquo;slower&rdquo; moving average.</p>
    <p>The purpose of the Signal Line is to&nbsp;<strong>smooth&nbsp;</strong>out the sensitivity of the MACD Line.</p>
    <p>The&nbsp;<strong>Histogram</strong>&nbsp;simply plots&nbsp;<strong>the&nbsp;<em>difference</em>&nbsp;between the MACD Line and Signal Line</strong>.</p>
    <p>It is a graphical representation of the&nbsp;<strong><em>distance&nbsp;</em>between the two lines</strong>.</p>
    <p>It may sometimes give you an early sign that a crossover is about to happen.</p>
    <p>If you look at our original chart, you can see that, as the two moving averages (MACD Line and Signal Line) separate, the histogram gets bigger.</p>
    <p>This is called a MACD&nbsp;<strong>divergence</strong>&nbsp;because the faster moving average (MACD Line) is &ldquo;diverging&rdquo; or moving away from the slower moving average (Signal Line).</p>
    <p>As the moving averages get closer to each other, the histogram gets smaller. This is called c<strong>onvergence</strong>&nbsp;because the faster moving average (MACD Line) is &ldquo;converging&rdquo; or getting closer to the slower moving average (Signal Line).</p>
    <p>And that, my friend, is how you get the name,&nbsp;<strong>M</strong>oving&nbsp;<strong>A</strong>verage&nbsp;<strong>C</strong>onvergence&nbsp;<strong>D</strong>ivergence! Whew, we need to crack our knuckles after that one!</p>
    <p>Ok, so now you know what MACD does. Now we&rsquo;ll show you what MACD can do for YOU.</p>
    <h2>How to Trade Using MACD</h2>
    <p>Because there are two moving averages with different &ldquo;speeds&rdquo;, the faster one will obviously be quicker to react to price movement than the slower one.</p>
    <p>When a new trend occurs, the&nbsp;<strong>faster line</strong>&nbsp;(MACD Line) will react first and eventually cross the&nbsp;<strong>slower line</strong>&nbsp;(Signal Line).</p>
    <p>When this &ldquo;crossover&rdquo; occurs, and the fast line starts to &ldquo;diverge&rdquo; or move away from the slower line, it often indicates that a new trend has formed.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade5-MACD-fast-slow.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>From the chart above, you can see that the fast line&nbsp;<strong>crossed UNDER&nbsp;</strong>the slow line and correctly identified a new downtrend.</p>
    <p>Notice that when the lines crossed, the Histogram temporarily disappears.</p>
    <p>This is because the&nbsp;<strong>difference between the lines at the time of the cross is 0</strong>.</p>
    <p>As the downtrend begins and the fast line diverges away from the slow line, the histogram gets bigger, which is a good indication of a strong trend.</p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at an example.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade5-MACD-example.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>In EUR/USD&rsquo;s 1-hour chart above, the fast line crossed above the slow line while the histogram disappeared. This suggested that the brief downtrend could potentially reverse.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;From then, EUR/USD began shooting up as it started a new uptrend. Imagine if you went long after the crossover, you would&rsquo;ve gained almost 200 pips!</p>
    <p>There is one drawback to MACD.</p>
    <p>Naturally,&nbsp;<strong>moving averages tend to LAG behind price</strong>.</p>
    <p>After all, it&rsquo;s just an average of historical prices.</p>
    <p>Remember, the MACD indicator consists of three components:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>The&nbsp;<strong>MACD Line</strong>&nbsp;which represents the difference between two moving averages.</li>
    <li>The&nbsp;<strong>Signal Lin</strong>e which is a moving average of the MACD Line.</li>
    <li>The&nbsp;<strong>Histogram</strong>&nbsp;which is&nbsp;a graphical representation of the distance between the MACD Line and Signal Line.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>That said, MACD is still one of the most favored tools by many traders.</p>
