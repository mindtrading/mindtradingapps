    <p>Ichimoku Kinko Hyo?</p>
    <p>Yes, you&rsquo;re still in the right place. You&rsquo;re still in the School of Pipsology and not in some Japanese pop or anime site.</p>
    <p>No, &ldquo;Ichimoku Kinko Hyo&rdquo; ain&rsquo;t Japanese for &ldquo;May the pips be with you.&rdquo; but it can help you grab those pips nonetheless.</p>
    <p><strong>Ichimoku Kinko Hyo</strong>&nbsp;(IKH) is an indicator that gauges future price momentum and determines future areas of support and resistance.</p>
    <p>Now that&rsquo;s 3-in-1 for y&rsquo;all! Also, know that this indicator is mainly used on JPY pairs.</p>
    <p>To add to your Japanese vocab, the word&nbsp;<em>ichimoku</em>&nbsp;translates to &ldquo;a glance&rdquo;,&nbsp;<em>kinko</em>&nbsp;means &ldquo;equilibrium&rdquo;, while&nbsp;<em>hyo</em>&nbsp;is Japanese for &ldquo;chart.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Putting that all together, the phrase&nbsp;<em>ichimoku kinko hyo</em>&nbsp;stands for &ldquo;a glance at a chart in equilibrium.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Huh, what does all that mean?</p>
    <p>A chart might make things easier to explain&hellip;</p>

    <p>Whoops. That didn&rsquo;t help. A few more lines and this will resemble a seismograph.</p>
    <p>Before you go off and call this gibberish, let&rsquo;s break down the components of Ichimoku Kinko Hyo so it&rsquo;s easy to understand.</p>
    <p>But before we do that, there are a couple of things about this indicator that you should know about first:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Ichimoku can be&nbsp;used in all time frames for any tradeable asset. (It was originally used to trade rice!)</li>
    <li>Ichimoku can be used in both rising and falling markets.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>So when CAN&rsquo;T you use Ichimoku?</p>
    <p><strong>When&nbsp;no clear trend exists.</strong></p>
    <p>Basically, when the market is trading sideways, choppy, aka trendless.</p>
    <p>You&rsquo;ll know it&rsquo;s trendless when the price is oscillating on either side of the cloud.</p>
    <p>Got it! Excellent.</p>
    <p>Now&nbsp;let&rsquo;s try to find out what each of the lines is for.</p>
    <p><strong>Kijun Sen</strong>&nbsp;(blue line): Also called the standard line or base line, this is calculated by averaging the highest high and the lowest low for the past 26 periods.</p>
    <p><strong>Tenkan Sen</strong>&nbsp;(red line): This is also known as the turning line and is derived by averaging the highest high and the lowest low for the past nine periods.</p>
    <p><strong>Chikou Span</strong>&nbsp;(green line): This is called the lagging line. It is today&rsquo;s closing price plotted 26 periods behind.</p>
    <p><strong>Senkou Span</strong>&nbsp;(orange lines): The first Senkou line is calculated by averaging the Tenkan Sen and the Kijun Sen and plotted 26 periods ahead.</p>
    <p>The second Senkou line is determined by averaging the highest high and the lowest low for the past 52 periods and plotted 26 periods ahead.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade5-ichimoku-kinko-hyo-indicators.png" alt="" />Got it? Well, it&rsquo;s not really necessary for you to memorize how each of the lines is computed.</p>
    <p>What&rsquo;s more important is for you to know how to interpret these fancy lines.</p>
    <h2>How to Trade Using Ichimoku Kinko Hyo</h2>
    <h3>Senkou</h3>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at the Senkou span first.</p>
    <p>If the price is above the Senkou span, the top line serves as the first support level while the bottom line serves as the second support level.</p>
    <p>If the price is below the Senkou span, the bottom line forms the first resistance level while the top line is the second resistance level. Got it?</p>
    <h3>Kijun Sen</h3>
    <p>Meanwhile, the Kijun Sen acts as an indicator of future price movement.</p>
    <p>If the price is higher than the blue line, it could continue to climb higher.</p>
    <p>If the price is below the blue line, it could keep dropping.</p>
    <h3>Tenkan Sen</h3>
    <p>The Tenkan Sen is an indicator of the market trend.</p>
    <p>If the red line is moving up or down, it indicates that the market is trending.</p>
    <p>If it moves horizontally, it signals that the market is ranging.</p>
    <h3>Chikou Span</h3>
    <p>Lastly, if the Chikou Span or the green line crosses the price in the bottom-up direction, that&rsquo;s a buy signal.</p>
    <p>If the green line crosses the price from the top-down, that&rsquo;s a sell signal.</p>
    <p>Here&rsquo;s that line-filled chart once more, this time with the trade signals:</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade5-ichimoku-kinko-hyo-example.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>It sure looks complicated at first but this baby&rsquo;s got support and resistance levels, crossovers, oscillators, and trend indicators all in one go! Amazing, right?</p>
    <p>As a trend following indicator, Ichimoku can be used in any market, in any timeframe.</p>
    <p>Regardless of the market, Ichimoku emphasizes to&nbsp;<strong>trade in the direction of the trend and NOT against the&nbsp;trend</strong>.</p>
    <p>By following trends, Ichimoku can help you to avoid entering the wrong side of where the market.</p>
    <p>Okey dokey, we&rsquo;ve already covered a smorgasbord of indicators. Let&rsquo;s see how we can put all of what you just learned together&hellip;</p>
