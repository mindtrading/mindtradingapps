    <p>Up until now, we&rsquo;ve looked at technical indicators that mainly focus on catching the beginning of new trends.</p>
    <p>Although it is important to be able to identify new trends, it is equally important to be able to&nbsp;<strong>identify where a trend ends</strong>.</p>
    <p>After all, what good is a well-timed entry without a well-timed exit?</p>
    <p><img title="Parabolic SAR" src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade5-parabolic-SAR.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>One indicator that can help us determine where a trend might be ending is the&nbsp;<strong>Parabolic SAR</strong>&nbsp;(<strong>S</strong>top&nbsp;<strong>A</strong>nd&nbsp;<strong>R</strong>eversal).</p>
    <p>A Parabolic SAR places dots, or points, on a chart that indicates potential reversals in price movement.</p>
    <p>From the image above, you can see that the dots shift from being below the candles during the uptrend to above the candles when the trend reverses into a downtrend.</p>
    <h2>How to Trade Using Parabolic SAR</h2>
    <p>The nice thing about the Parabolic SAR&nbsp;is that it is really simple to use. We mean REALLY simple.</p>
    <p>Basically, when the dots are below the candles, it is a&nbsp;<strong>BUY</strong>&nbsp;signal.</p>
    <p>When the dots are above the candles, it is a&nbsp;<strong>SELL</strong>&nbsp;signal.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade5-how-to-use-parabolic-sar.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>Simple?</p>
    <p>Yes, we thought so.</p>
    <p>This is probably the easiest indicator to interpret because it assumes that the price is either going up or down. With that said,&nbsp;<strong>this tool is best used in markets that are trending, and that have long rallies and downturns.</strong></p>
    <p>You&nbsp;<strong>DON&rsquo;T</strong>&nbsp;want to use this tool in a choppy market where the price movement is sideways.</p>
    <h2>How to use Parabolic SAR to exit trades</h2>
    <p>You can also use Parabolic SAR to help you determine whether you should close your trade or not.</p>
    <p>Check out how the Parabolic SAR worked as an exit signal in EUR/USD&rsquo;s daily chart below.</p>
    <p><img title="Parabolic SAR exit" src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade5-parabolic-SAR-example.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>When EUR/USD&nbsp;started sliding down in late April, it seemed like it would just keep droppin&rsquo; like a rock.</p>
    <p>A trader who was able to short this pair has probably wondered how low it&rsquo;d continue to go.</p>
    <p>In early June, three dots formed at the bottom of the price, suggesting that the downtrend was over and that it was time to exit those shorts.</p>
    <p>If you stubbornly decided to hold on to that trade thinking that EUR/USD would resume its drop, you would&rsquo;ve probably erased all those winnings since the pair eventually climbed back near 1.3500.</p>
