    <p>The&nbsp;<strong>Stochastic</strong>&nbsp;oscillator is another technical indicator that helps traders determine where a trend might be ending.</p>
    <p>The oscillator works on the following theory:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>During an&nbsp;<strong>uptrend</strong>,&nbsp;prices will remain&nbsp;<em>equal to or above</em>&nbsp;the previous closing price.</li>
    <li>During a&nbsp;<strong>downtrend,</strong>&nbsp;prices will likely remain&nbsp;<em>equal to or below</em>&nbsp;the previous closing price.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>This simple momentum oscillator was created by George Lane in the late 1950s.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Stochastics measures the momentum of price. If you visualize a rocket going up in the air &ndash; before it can turn down, it must slow down. Momentum always changes direction before price.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The Stochastic oscillator uses a scale to measure the degree of change between prices from one closing period to predict the&nbsp;<strong>continuation of the current direction trend</strong>.</p>
    <p>The 2 lines are similar to the MACD&nbsp;lines in the sense that one line is faster than the other.</p>

    <h2>How to Trade Forex Using the Stochastic Indicator</h2>
    <p>The Stochastic technical indicator tells us when the market is overbought or oversold. The Stochastic is scaled from&nbsp;<strong>0 to 100</strong>.</p>
    <p>When the Stochastic lines are&nbsp;<strong>above 80</strong>&nbsp;(the red dotted line in the chart above), then it means the market is overbought.</p>
    <p>When the Stochastic lines are&nbsp;<strong>below 20</strong>&nbsp;(the blue dotted line), then it means that the market is&nbsp;<em>possibly</em>&nbsp;oversold.</p>
    <p>As a rule of thumb, we buy when the market is oversold, and we sell when the market is&nbsp;<em>possibly</em>&nbsp;overbought.</p>

    <p>Looking at the currency chart above, you can see that the indicator&nbsp;has been showing overbought conditions for quite some time.</p>
    <p>Based on this information, can you guess where the price might go?</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade5-stochastic-overbought-end.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>If you said the price would drop, then you are absolutely correct! Because the market was overbought for such a long period of time, a reversal was bound to happen.</p>
    <p>That is the basics of Stochastic.</p>
    <p>Many forex traders use the Stochastic in different ways, but the main purpose of the indicator is to show us where the market conditions could be&nbsp;<em>possibly</em>&nbsp;overbought or oversold.</p>
    <p>Keep in mind that&nbsp;<strong>Stochastic can remain above 80 or below 20 for long periods of time</strong>, so just because the indicator says &ldquo;overbought&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t mean you should blindly sell!</p>
    <p>The same thing if you see &ldquo;oversold&rdquo;, it doesn&rsquo;t mean you should automatically start buying!</p>
    <p><strong>Don&rsquo;t be a Stochastic Sheep!</strong></p>

    <p>Over time, you will learn to use the Stochastic indicator to fit your own personal trading style.</p>
    <p>Okay, let&rsquo;s move on to RSI.</p>
