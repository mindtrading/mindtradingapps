    <p>Now on to the good stuff: Just how profitable is each technical indicator on its own?</p>
    <p>After all, forex traders don&rsquo;t include these technical indicators just to make their charts look nicer. Traders are in the business of making money!</p>
    <p>If these indicators generate signals that don&rsquo;t translate into a profitable bottom line over time, then they&rsquo;re simply not the way to go for your needs!</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade6-momentum-indicators-right2.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>In order to give y&rsquo;all a comparison of the effectiveness of each technical indicator, we&rsquo;ve decided to backtest each of the indicators on their own for the past 5 years.</p>
    <p>Backtesting involves retroactively testing the parameters of the indicators against historical price action.</p>
    <p>You&rsquo;ll learn more about this in your future studies. For now, just take a look at the parameters we used for our backtest.</p>

    <p>Using these parameters, we tested each of the technical indicators on its own on the daily time frame of EUR/USD over the past 5 years.</p>
    <p>We are trading 1 lot (that&rsquo;s 100,000 units) at a time with no set stop losses or take profit points.</p>
    <p>We simply cover and switch position once a new signal appears. This means if we initially had a long position when the indicator told us to sell, we would cover and establish a new short position.</p>
    <p>Also, we were assuming we were well capitalized (as suggested in our Leverage lesson) and started with a hypothetical balance of $100,000.</p>
    <p>Aside from the actual profit and loss of each strategy, we included total pips gained/lost and the max drawdown.</p>
    <p>Again, let us just remind you that we&nbsp;<strong>DO NOT SUGGEST</strong>&nbsp;trading forex without any stop losses. This is just for illustrative purposes only! Moving on, here are the results of our backtest:</p>

    <p>The data showed that over the past 5-years, the indicator that performed the best on its own was the Ichimoku Kinko Hyo indicator.</p>
    <p>It generated a total profit of $30,341, or 30.35%. Over 5 years, that gives us an average of just over 6% per year!</p>
    <p>Surprisingly, the rest of the technical indicators were a lot less profitable, with the Stochastic indicator showing a return of negative 20.72%.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, all of the indicators led to substantial drawdowns of between 20% to 30%.</p>
    <p>However, this does not mean that the Ichimoku Kinko Hyo indicator is the best or that technical indicators as a whole are useless. Rather, this just goes to show that they aren&rsquo;t that useful on their own.</p>
