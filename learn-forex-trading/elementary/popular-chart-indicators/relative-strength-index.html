    <p><strong>Relative Strength Index</strong>, or RSI, is a popular indicator developed by a technical analyst named J. Welles Wilder,&nbsp;that&nbsp;helps traders evaluate the strength of the current market.</p>
    <p>RSI is similar to Stochastic in that it identifies overbought and oversold conditions in the market.</p>
    <p>It is also scaled from&nbsp;<strong>0 to 100</strong>.</p>
    <p>Typically, readings&nbsp;<strong>of 30 or&nbsp;lower</strong>&nbsp;indicate oversold market conditions and an increase in the&nbsp;<em>possibility of price strengthening&nbsp;</em>(going up).</p>
    <p>Some traders interpret that an oversold currency pair is an indication that the falling trend is likely to reverse, which means it&rsquo;s an opportunity to&nbsp;<strong>buy</strong>.</p>
    <p>Readings&nbsp;<strong>of 70 or higher&nbsp;</strong>indicate overbought conditions and an increase in the&nbsp;<em>possibility of price weakening</em>&nbsp;(going down).</p>
    <p>Some traders interpret that an overbought currency pair is an indication that the rising trend is likely to reverse, which means it&rsquo;s an opportunity to&nbsp;<strong>sell</strong>.</p>

    <p>In addition to the overbought and oversold indicators mentioned above, traders who use the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator also look for&nbsp;<strong>centerline crossovers.&nbsp;</strong></p>
    <p>A movement from&nbsp;<strong>below the centerline (50) to above</strong>&nbsp;indicates a<em>&nbsp;rising trend.</em></p>
    <p>A&nbsp;<strong>rising centerline crossover</strong>&nbsp;occurs when the RSI value crosses ABOVE the 50 line on the scale, moving towards the 70 line. This indicates the market trend is&nbsp;<em>increasing in&nbsp;</em>strength, and is seen as a&nbsp;<strong>bullish</strong>&nbsp;signal until the RSI approaches the 70 line.</p>
    <p>A movement from&nbsp;<strong>above the centerline (50) to below</strong>&nbsp;indicates a&nbsp;<em>falling trend</em>.</p>
    <p>A&nbsp;<strong>falling centerline crossover</strong>&nbsp;occurs when the RSI value crosses BELOW the 50 line on the scale, moving towards the 30&nbsp;line. This indicates the market trend is&nbsp;<em>weakening in&nbsp;</em>strength, and is seen as a&nbsp;<strong>bearish</strong>&nbsp;signal until the RSI approaches the 30&nbsp;line.</p>
    <h2>How to Trade Using RSI</h2>
    <p>RSI can be used just like the Stochastic indicator.</p>
    <p>We can use it to pick potential tops and bottoms depending on whether the market is overbought or oversold.</p>
    <p>Below is a 4-hour chart of EUR/USD.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade5-rsi-oversold.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>EUR/USD had been dropping the week, falling about 400 pips over the course of two weeks.</p>
    <p>On June 7, it was already trading below the 1.2000 handle.</p>
    <p>However, RSI dropped below 30, signaling that there might be no more sellers left in the market and that the move could be over.</p>
    <p>Price then reversed and headed back up over the next couple of weeks.</p>
    <h2>Determining the Trend using RSI</h2>
    <p>RSI is a very popular tool because it can also be used to confirm trend formations.</p>
    <p>If you think a trend is forming, take a quick look at the RSI and look at whether it is above or below 50.</p>
    <p>If you are looking at a possible UPTREND, then make sure the RSI is&nbsp;<strong>above 50</strong>.</p>
    <p>If you are looking at a possible DOWNTREND, then make sure the RSI is&nbsp;<strong>below 50</strong>.</p>

    <p>At the beginning of the chart above, we can see that a possible downtrend was forming.</p>
    <p>To avoid fakeouts, we can wait for RSI to cross below 50 to confirm our trend.</p>
    <p>Sure enough, as RSI passes below 50, it is a good confirmation that a downtrend has actually formed.</p>
