    <p>When trading, it can be helpful to gauge the strength of a trend,&nbsp;<em>regardless</em>&nbsp;of its direction.</p>
    <p>And when it comes to evaluating the strength of a trend, the&nbsp;<strong>Average Directional Index</strong>&nbsp;is a popular technical indicator for this purpose.</p>
    <p>The&nbsp;<strong>Average Directional Index</strong>, or ADX for short, is another example of an oscillator.</p>
    <p>ADX fluctuates from&nbsp;<strong>0 to 100</strong>, with readings&nbsp;<strong>below 20</strong>&nbsp;indicating a weak trend and readings&nbsp;<strong>above 50</strong>&nbsp;signaling a strong trend.</p>
    <p>The ADX calculation can be complicated, but in a nutshell, the stronger the trend, the higher ADX goes</p>
    <p>When the ADX is low, it highlights periods when the price is usually going sideways or trading in a range.</p>
    <p>When the ADX has risen above 50, this indicates that the price has picked up momentum in one direction.</p>
    <p>Unlike Stochastic, ADX does NOT determine whether the trend is bullish or bearish. Rather, it merely&nbsp;<strong>measures the strength of the current trend</strong>.</p>
    <p>Because of that,&nbsp;<strong>ADX is typically used to identify whether the market is ranging or starting a new trend</strong>.</p>
    <p>ADX is considered a &ldquo;non-directional&rdquo; indicator. It is based on comparing the highs and lows of bars and does not use the close of the bar.</p>
    <p><strong>The&nbsp;<em>stronger the trend</em>, the larger the reading regardless of whether it is an uptrend or downtrend.</strong></p>
    <h2>How to Use ADX</h2>
    <p>When you&rsquo;re using the ADX indicator, keep an eye on the 20 and 40 as key levels.</p>
    <p>here&rsquo;s a little cheat sheet to help you interpret ADX values.</p>
    <div>
    <div>
    <table border="1px">
    <tbody>
    <tr>
    <td><strong>ADX Value</strong></td>
    <td><strong>Indication</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Rising</td>
    <td>Strengthening trend</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Falling</td>
    <td>Weakening trend</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Below 20</td>
    <td>Weak trend</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Between 20 and 40</td>
    <td>Strong trend</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Above 40</td>
    <td>Extreme trend</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>Take a look at these neat charts we&rsquo;ve pulled up:</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade5-ADX-downtrend2-3.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>In this first example, ADX lingered&nbsp;<strong>below 20</strong>&nbsp;from late September until early December.</p>
    <p>As you can see from the chart, EUR/CHF was stuck inside a range during that time.</p>
    <p>Beginning in January though, ADX started to&nbsp;<strong>climb above 50</strong>, signaling that a strong trend could be waiting in the wings.</p>
    <p>And would you look at that! EUR/CHF broke below the bottom of the range and went on a strong downtrend. Ooh, that&rsquo;d be around 400 pips in the bag.</p>
    <p>Book it, baby!</p>
    <p>Now, let&rsquo;s look at this next example:</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade5-ADX-uptrend2-2.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>Just like in our first example, ADX hovered&nbsp;<strong>below 20</strong>&nbsp;for quite a while. At that time, EUR/CHF was also ranging.</p>
    <p>Soon enough, ADX rose above 50 and EUR/CHF broke above the top of its range.</p>
    <p>Tada!</p>
    <p>A strong uptrend took place. That&rsquo;d be 300 pips, signed, sealed, and delivered!</p>
    <p>Looks simple enough, right?</p>
    <p>If there&rsquo;s one problem with using ADX, it&rsquo;s that it doesn&rsquo;t exactly tell you whether it&rsquo;s a buy or a sell.</p>
    <p>What it does tell you is whether it&rsquo;d be okay to jump in an ongoing trend or not.</p>
    <p>Once ADX starts dropping below 50 again, it could mean that the uptrend or downtrend is starting to weaken and that it might be a good time to lock in profits.</p>
    <h2>How to Trade Using ADX</h2>
    <p>One way to trade using ADX is to wait for breakouts first before deciding to go long or short.</p>
    <p>ADX can be used as confirmation whether the pair could possibly continue in its current trend or not.</p>
    <p>Another way is to combine ADX with another indicator, particularly one that identifies whether the pair is headed downwards or upwards.</p>
    <p>ADX can also be used to determine when one should close a trade early.</p>
    <p>For instance, when ADX starts to slide below 50, it indicates that the current trend is losing steam.</p>
    <p>From then on, the pair could possibly move sideways, so you might want to lock in those pips before that happens.</p>
    <p>As the saying goes, &ldquo;The trend is your friend.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Until it stabs you in the back.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2011/02/16200827/trend-is-your-friend.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>Oh wait.</p>
    <p>I mean&hellip;&rdquo; Until it&nbsp;<em>reverses</em>.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>(Got caught up in memories for a moment there.)</p>
    <p>The next time you think a trend is changing and you need to decide whether to stick to this &ldquo;friend&rdquo; or cut ties, consider trying the ADX to confirm the trend&rsquo;s strength.</p>
