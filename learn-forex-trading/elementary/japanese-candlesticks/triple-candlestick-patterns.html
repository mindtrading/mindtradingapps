    <p>What&rsquo;s better than dual candlestick patterns?</p>
    <p>TRIPLE candlestick patterns!</p>
    <p>To identify triple Japanese candlestick patterns, you need to look for specific formations that consist of three candlesticks in total.</p>
    <p>These candlestick formations help traders determine how the price is likely to behave next.</p>
    <p>Some three candlestick patterns are&nbsp;<strong>reversal patterns</strong>, which&nbsp;signal&nbsp;<em>the end of the current trend</em>&nbsp;and the start of a new trend in the opposite direction.</p>
    <p>And other three candlestick patterns are&nbsp;<strong>continuation patterns</strong>, which&nbsp;signal&nbsp;a pause and then the&nbsp;<em>continuation of the current trend</em>.</p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at the popular triple Japanese candlestick patterns.</p>
    <h2>Evening and Morning Stars</h2>
    <p>The Morning Star and the&nbsp;Evening Star are triple candlestick patterns that you can usually find at the&nbsp;<strong>end of a trend</strong>.</p>
    <p>They are reversal patterns that can be recognized through three characteristics.</p>
    <p><img title="Candlestick Patterns: Morning and Evening Star" src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade2-morning-evening-star.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>We&rsquo;ll use the Evening Star Pattern on&nbsp;the right as an example of what you may see:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>The first candlestick is a&nbsp;<strong>bullish candle</strong>, which is part of a recent&nbsp;<strong>uptrend</strong>.</li>
    <li>The second candle has a&nbsp;<strong>small body</strong>, indicating that there could be some indecision in the market. This candle can be either bullish or bearish.</li>
    <li>The third candlestick acts as a confirmation that a reversal is in place, as the candle&nbsp;<strong>closes beyond the midpoint</strong>&nbsp;of the first candle.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Three White Soldiers and Black Crows</h2>
    <p>The&nbsp;<strong>Three White Soldiers</strong>&nbsp;pattern is formed when three long bullish candles follow a DOWNTREND, signaling a reversal has occurred.</p>
    <p><img title="Candlestick Patterns: Three White Soldiers and Three Black Crows" src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade2-three-white-soldiers-three-black-crows.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>This type of triple candlestick pattern is considered as one of the most potent in-yo-face bullish signals, especially when it occurs after an extended downtrend and a short period of consolidation.</p>
    <p>The first of the &ldquo;three soldiers&rdquo; is called the reversal candle. It either ends the downtrend or implies that the period of consolidation that followed the downtrend is over.</p>
    <p>For the Three White Soldiers pattern to&nbsp;be considered valid, the second candlestick should be bigger than the previous candle&rsquo;s body.</p>
    <p>Also, the second candlestick should close near its high, leaving a small or non-existent upper wick.</p>
    <p>For the Three White Soldiers pattern to be completed, the last candlestick should be at least the same size as the second candle and have a small or no shadow.</p>
    <p>The&nbsp;<strong>Three Black Crows</strong>&nbsp;candlestick pattern is just the opposite of the Three White Soldiers.</p>
    <p>It is formed when three bearish candles follow a strong UPTREND, indicating that a reversal is in the works.</p>
    <p>The second candle&rsquo;s body should be bigger than the first candle and should close at or very near its low.</p>
    <p>Finally, the third candle should be the same size or larger than the second candle&rsquo;s body with a very short or no lower shadow.</p>
    <p>For the Three Black Crows pattern to be completed, the last candlestick should be at least the same size as the second candle and have a small or no shadow.</p>
    <h2>Three Inside Up and Down</h2>
    <p><img title="Candlestick Patterns: Three Inside Up and Three Inside Down" src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade2-three-inside.png" alt="" /><br />The&nbsp;<strong>Three Inside Up</strong>&nbsp;candlestick formation is a trend-reversal pattern that is found at the bottom of a DOWNTREND.</p>
    <p>This triple candlestick pattern&nbsp;indicates that the downtrend is possibly over and that a new uptrend has started.</p>
    <p>For a valid three inside up candlestick formation, look for these properties:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>The first candle should be found at the bottom of a&nbsp;<strong>downtrend</strong>&nbsp;and is characterized by a&nbsp;<strong>long bearish candlestick.</strong></li>
    <li>The second candle should at least make it up all the way up to the&nbsp;<strong>midpoint</strong>&nbsp;of the first candle.</li>
    <li>The third candlestick needs to&nbsp;<strong>close above the first candle&rsquo;s high</strong>&nbsp;to confirm that buyers have overpowered the strength of the downtrend.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Conversely, the&nbsp;<strong>Three Inside Down</strong>&nbsp;candlestick formation is found at the top of an UPTREND.</p>
    <p>It means that the uptrend is possibly over and that a new downtrend has started.</p>
    <p>A Three Inside Down candlestick formation needs to have the following characteristics:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>The first candle should be found at the top of an&nbsp;<strong>uptrend</strong>&nbsp;and is characterized by a&nbsp;<strong>long bullish candlestick</strong>.</li>
    <li>The second candle should make it up all the way down the&nbsp;<strong>midpoint</strong>&nbsp;of the first candle.</li>
    <li>The third candlestick needs to&nbsp;<strong>close below the first candle&rsquo;s low</strong>&nbsp;to confirm that sellers have overpowered the strength of the uptrend.</li>
    </ol>
