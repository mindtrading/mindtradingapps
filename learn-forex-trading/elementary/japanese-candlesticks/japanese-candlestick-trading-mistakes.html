    <p>Japanese candlesticks are a popular charting technique used in technical analysis to analyze price action and predict future price movements.</p>
    <p>While they can be a powerful tool for traders, new traders often make common mistakes when using Japanese candlesticks.</p>
    <p>Here are some common mistakes that new traders often make when using Japanese candlesticks.</p>
    <h2>1. You try to find meaning in EVERY candlestick that appears on the chart.</h2>
    <p>A lot of the time, markets are &ldquo;noisy.&rdquo; Not every candlestick is useful when thinking about future price movements.</p>
    <p>Instead of looking at every candlestick, focus on the ones where the price is currently trading&nbsp;<strong>near important support and resistance levels.</strong></p>
    <p>So first&nbsp;<em>identify&nbsp;</em>where you think these levels are, and then start looking out for candlestick patterns.</p>
    <h2>2. Your imagination is too strong.</h2>
    <p>If you have to zoom in 500% or squint at the Japanese candlestick chart because you think &ldquo;You see something&rdquo;, there&rsquo;s probably nothing there.</p>
    <p>You don&rsquo;t have to try and assign a textbook label to candlestick formations you see.</p>
    <p>Focus on finding evidence of&nbsp;<strong>strong buying pressure when you expect to buy</strong>, and evidence of&nbsp;<strong>strong selling pressure when you expect selling</strong>.</p>
    <h2>3. Your imagination is too weak.</h2>
    <p>Japanese candlestick patterns that are supposed to form after&nbsp;<em>three</em>&nbsp;candles based on textbook examples may actually end up forming over&nbsp;<em>five</em>&nbsp;candles.</p>
    <p>Just because a three-candlestick pattern takes four candlesticks to form doesn&rsquo;t invalidate the pattern.</p>
    <p>The meaning is still the same. It&rsquo;s more important to understand the&nbsp;<strong>price action behind the candlestick pattern</strong>&nbsp;than to simply memorize its standard form.</p>
    <h2>4. You forget the forest from the trees.</h2>
    <p>If you constantly just focus on shorter time frames like 5-minute charts without stepping back and trying to look at the &ldquo;bigger picture&rdquo;, your trades will tend to get blindsided.</p>
    <p><strong>Try not to make your focus too narrow.</strong></p>
    <h2>5. You don&rsquo;t wait for confirmation.</h2>
    <p>There are some candlestick patterns that are considered &ldquo;self-confirming&rdquo;, but many are not.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Make sure&nbsp;to wait until the&nbsp;<strong>candlestick closes and is fully formed</strong>&nbsp;before acting on a pattern.</p>
    <p>Always wait for the right confirmation that the price is moving in the direction you&rsquo;re expecting.</p>
    <p>For example, if you see a Tweezer Bottom, it&rsquo;s more prudent to wait and make sure that the candlestick after the dual candlestick pattern closes&nbsp;<em>higher&nbsp;</em>before going long.</p>
