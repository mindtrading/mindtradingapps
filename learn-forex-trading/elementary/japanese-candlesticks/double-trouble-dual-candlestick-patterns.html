    <p>What&rsquo;s better than single candlestick patterns?</p>
    <p>DUAL candlestick patterns!</p>
    <p>To identify dual Japanese candlestick patterns, you need to look for specific formations that consist of TWO candlesticks in total.</p>
    <h2>Engulfing Candles</h2>
    <p>There are two types of Engulfing candles: Bullish Engulfing and Bearish Engulfing.</p>
    <p><img title="Candlestick Patterns: Bullish and Bearish Engulfing" src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/assets_c-2010-10-bullish-bearish-engulfing-thumb-525x333-6823.png" alt="Candlestick Patterns: Bullish and Bearish Engulfing" width="525" height="333" /></p>
    <p>The&nbsp;<strong>Bullish Engulfing pattern</strong>&nbsp;is a two candlestick&nbsp;<strong>reversal</strong>&nbsp;pattern that signals a strong up move may occur.</p>
    <p>It happens when a bearish candle is immediately followed by a larger bullish candle.</p>
    <p>This second candle &ldquo;engulfs&rdquo; the bearish candle. This means buyers are flexing their muscles and that there could be a strong up move after a recent downtrend or a period of consolidation.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, the&nbsp;<strong>Bearish Engulfing pattern</strong>&nbsp;is the opposite of the bullish pattern.</p>
    <p>This type of candlestick pattern occurs when the bullish candle is immediately followed by a bearish candle that completely &ldquo;engulfs&rdquo; it.</p>
    <p>This means that sellers overpowered the buyers and that a strong move down could happen.</p>
    <h2>Tweezer Bottoms and Tops</h2>
    <p>Tweezer patterns are two candlestick&nbsp;<strong>reversal</strong>&nbsp;patterns.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2011/03/24142048/tweezer.png" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" srcset="https://bpcdn.co/images/2011/03/24142048/tweezer.png 200w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2011/03/24142048/tweezer-150x150.png 150w" alt="Tweezers" width="200" height="200" /></p>
    <p>This type of candlestick pattern is&nbsp;usually spotted after an extended uptrend or downtrend, indicating that a reversal will soon occur.</p>
    <p>There are two types of Tweezer patterns: the Tweezer Bottom and the Tweezer Top.</p>
    <p>Notice how the candlestick formation looks just like a pair of tweezers!</p>
    <p>Amazing!</p>
    <p><img title="Candlestick Patterns: Tweezer Bottoms and Tweezer Tops" src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade2-tweezer-tops-bottoms.png" alt="Candlestick Patterns: Tweezer Bottoms and Tweezer Tops" width="525" height="333" /></p>
    <p>The most effective Tweezers have the following characteristics:</p>
    <p>The first candlestick is the same as the overall trend. If the price is moving up, then the first candle should be bullish.</p>
    <p>The second candlestick is opposite the overall trend. If the price is moving up, then the second candle should be bearish.</p>
    <p>The shadows of the candlesticks should be of equal (or near-equal) length.</p>
    <p>Tweezer Tops should have the same highs, while Tweezer Bottoms should have the same lows.</p>
