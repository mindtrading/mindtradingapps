    <p>Let&rsquo;s break down the different parts of a&nbsp;<strong>Japanese candlestick</strong>.</p>
    <h2>Sexy Bodies</h2>
    <p>Just like humans, candlesticks have different body sizes. And when it comes to forex trading, there&rsquo;s nothing naughtier than checking out the bodies of candlesticks!</p>
    <p><img title="Japanese Candlestick Anatomy" src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade2-sexy-body2.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p><em>Long</em>&nbsp;bodies indicate strong buying or selling.</p>
    <p><strong>The longer the body is, the more intense the buying or selling pressure</strong>. This means that either buyers or sellers were stronger and took control.</p>
    <p><em>Short</em>&nbsp;bodies imply&nbsp;<strong>very little buying or selling activity</strong>. In trading lingo, bulls mean buyers and bears&nbsp;mean sellers.</p>
    <p><img title="Long vs. Short Japanese Candlesticks" src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade2-long-short-candlestick.png" alt="" />Long white Japanese candlesticks show&nbsp;<strong>strong buying pressure</strong>.</p>
    <p>The longer the white candlestick, the further the close is above the open.</p>
    <p>This indicates that prices increased considerably from open to close and buyers were aggressive. In other words, the bulls were kicking the bears&rsquo; butts big time!</p>
    <p>Long black (filled) candlesticks show&nbsp;<strong>strong selling pressure</strong>.</p>
    <p>The longer the black Japanese candlestick, the further the close is below the open.</p>
    <p>This indicates that prices fell a great deal from the open and sellers were aggressive. In other words, the bears were grabbing the bulls by their horns and body-slamming them.</p>
    <h2>Mysterious Shadows</h2>
    <p>No, we&rsquo;re not talking about wearing dark smokey eye shadow.</p>
    <p>The upper and lower shadows on Japanese candlesticks provide important clues about the trading session.</p>
    <p><strong>Upper shadows</strong>&nbsp;signify the session high.</p>
    <p><strong>Lower shadows</strong>&nbsp;signify the session low.</p>
    <p>Candlesticks with long shadows show that trading action occurred well past the open and close.</p>
    <p>Japanese candlesticks with short shadows indicate that most of the trading action was confined near the open and close.</p>

    <p>If a Japanese candlestick has a&nbsp;<em>long upper shadow and short lower shadow</em>, this means that buyers flexed their muscles and bid prices higher.</p>
    <p>But for one reason or another,&nbsp;<strong>sellers came in and drove prices back DOWN to end the session back near its open price</strong>.</p>
    <p>If a Japanese candlestick has a&nbsp;<em>long lower shadow and short upper shadow</em>, this means that sellers flashed their washboard abs and forced the price lower.</p>
    <p>But for one reason or another,&nbsp;<strong>buyers came in and drove prices back UP to end the session back near its open price</strong>.</p>
