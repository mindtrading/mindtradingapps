    <p>Now that you&rsquo;re familiar with basic candlestick patterns like spinning tops, marubozus, and dojis, let&rsquo;s learn how to recognize<strong>&nbsp;single candlestick patterns.</strong></p>
    <p>When these types of candlesticks appear on a chart, they can<strong>&nbsp;signal potential market reversals</strong>.</p>
    <p>Here are the four basic single Japanese candlestick patterns:</p>
    <h2>Hammer and Hanging Man</h2>
    <p>The&nbsp;<strong>Hammer&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Hanging Man</strong>&nbsp;look exactly alike but have totally different meanings depending on past price action.</p>
    <p>Both have cute little bodies (black or white), long lower shadows, and short or absent upper shadows.</p>

    <p>The&nbsp;<strong>Hammer&nbsp;</strong>is a bullish reversal pattern that forms during a downtrend. It is named because the market is hammering out a bottom.</p>
    <p>When the price is falling, hammers signal that<strong>&nbsp;the bottom is near</strong>&nbsp;and the price will start rising again.</p>
    <p>The long lower shadow indicates that sellers pushed prices lower, but buyers were able to overcome this selling pressure and closed near the open.</p>
    <p>Just because you see a hammer form in a downtrend doesn&rsquo;t mean you automatically place a buy order! More bullish confirmation is needed before it&rsquo;s safe to pull the trigger.</p>
    <p>A typical example of confirmation would be to wait for a white candlestick to close above the open to the right side of the Hammer.</p>
    <h3>Recognition Criteria for a Hammer:</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>The long shadow is about two or three times of the real body.</li>
    <li>Little or no upper shadow.</li>
    <li>The real body is at the upper end of the trading range.</li>
    <li>The color of the real body is not important.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The&nbsp;<strong>Hanging Man</strong>&nbsp;is a bearish reversal pattern that can also mark a top or strong resistance level.</p>
    <p>When the price is rising, the formation of a Hanging Man&nbsp;indicates that sellers are beginning to outnumber buyers.</p>
    <p>The long lower shadow shows that sellers pushed prices lower during the session.</p>
    <p>Buyers were able to push the price back up some but only near the open.</p>
    <p>This should set off alarms since this tells us that there are no buyers left to provide the necessary momentum to keep raising the price.</p>
    <h3>Recognition Criteria for a Hanging Man:</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>A long lower shadow which is about two or three times of the real body.</li>
    <li>Little or no upper shadow.</li>
    <li>The real body is at the upper end of the trading range.</li>
    <li>The color of the body is not important, though a black body is more bearish than a white body.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Inverted Hammer and Shooting Star</h2>
    <p>The&nbsp;<strong>Inverted Hammer</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Shooting Star&nbsp;</strong>also look identical. The only difference between them is&nbsp;<strong>whether you&rsquo;re in a downtrend or uptrend.</strong></p>
    <p>An Inverted Hammer is&nbsp;a&nbsp;<strong>bullish</strong>&nbsp;reversal candlestick.</p>
    <p>A Shooting Star is a&nbsp;<strong>bearish&nbsp;</strong>reversal candlestick.</p>
    <p>Both candlesticks have petite little bodies (filled or hollow), long upper shadows, and small or absent lower shadows.</p>

    <h3>Inverted Hammer</h3>
    <p>The&nbsp;<strong>Inverted Hammer</strong>&nbsp;occurs when the price has been falling suggests the possibility of a reversal. Its long upper shadow shows that buyers tried to bid the price higher.</p>
    <p>However, sellers saw what the buyers were doing, said &ldquo;Oh heck no!&rdquo; and attempted to push the price back down.</p>
    <p>Fortunately, the buyers had eaten enough of their Wheaties for breakfast and still managed to close the session near the open.</p>
    <p>Since the sellers weren&rsquo;t able to close the price any lower, this is a good indication that everybody who wants to sell has already sold.</p>
    <p>And if there are no more sellers, who are left? Buyers.</p>
    <h3>Shooting Star</h3>
    <p>The&nbsp;<strong>Shooting Star</strong>&nbsp;is a bearish reversal pattern that looks identical to the inverted hammer but occurs when the price has been rising.</p>
    <p>Its shape indicates that the price opened at its low, rallied, but pulled back to the bottom.</p>
    <p>This means that buyers attempted to push the price up, but sellers came in and overpowered them. This is a definite bearish sign since there are no more buyers left because they&rsquo;ve all been overpowered.</p>
