    <p>We&rsquo;ve covered a lot about Japanese candlesticks.</p>
    <p>Hopefully, you&rsquo;re not at&nbsp;<em>wick&rsquo;s</em>&nbsp;end but are actually now&nbsp;<em>fired</em>&nbsp;up about candlestick charts.</p>
    <p>Maybe we&rsquo;ve even ignited a&nbsp;<em>flame</em>&nbsp;that becomes a lifelong passion for Japanese candlesticks.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2011/02/japanese-candlestick-goodbye.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s summarize what you&rsquo;ve learned about Japanese candlesticks:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>If the close is above the open, then a hollow candlestick (usually displayed as white) is drawn.</li>
    <li>If the close is below the open, then a filled candlestick (usually displayed as black) is drawn.</li>
    <li>The hollow or filled section of the candlestick is called the &ldquo;real body&rdquo; or body.</li>
    <li>The thin lines poking above and below the body display the high/low range and are called shadows.</li>
    <li>The top of the upper shadow is the &ldquo;high&rdquo;.</li>
    <li>The bottom of the lower shadow is the &ldquo;low&rdquo;.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Long bodies indicate strong buying or selling. The longer the body is, the more intense the buying or selling pressure.</p>
    <p>Short bodies imply very little buying or selling activity. In street forex lingo, bulls mean buyers and bears mean sellers.</p>
    <p>Upper shadows signify the session high.</p>
    <p>Lower shadows signify the session low.</p>
    <p>There are many types of Japanese candlestick patterns, but they can be categorized into how many bars make up the candlestick pattern.</p>
    <p>There are single, dual, and triple candlestick formations.</p>
    <p>The most common types of Japanese candlestick patterns are the following:</p>
    <div>
    <div>
    <table border="1px" width="100%">
    <tbody>
    <tr>
    <th scope="col">NUMBER OF BARS</th>
    <th scope="col">JAPANESE CANDLESTICK PATTERN</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><strong>Single</strong></td>
    <td>Spinning Tops, Dojis, Marubozu, Inverted Hammer, Hanging Man, Shooting Star</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><strong>Two</strong></td>
    <td>Bullish and Bearish Engulfing, Tweezer Tops and Bottoms</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><strong>Three</strong></td>
    <td>Morning and Evening Stars, Three Black Crows and Three White Soldiers, Three Inside Up and Down</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>
    </div>
    </div>
    <p>Just refer to the Japanese Candlesticks Cheat Sheet for a quick reference on what these candlestick patterns mean.</p>
    <p>Combine candlestick analysis with support and resistance levels for the best results.</p>
    <p>And finally, here are some words of wisdom:</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Just because Japanese candlesticks hint at a reversal or continuation, it doesn&rsquo;t mean it will happen for sure! You must always consider market conditions and what price action is telling you.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>This is the forex market and nothing is set in stone!</p>
