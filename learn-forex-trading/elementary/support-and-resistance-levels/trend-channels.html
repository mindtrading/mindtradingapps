    <p>If we take this trend line theory one step further and draw a parallel line at the same angle of the uptrend or downtrend, we will have created a &ldquo;<strong>channel&rdquo;</strong>.</p>
    <p>No, we&rsquo;re not talking about ESPN, National Geographic Channel, or Cartoon Network.</p>
    <p>These channels aren&rsquo;t television channels, they&rsquo;re&nbsp;<strong>trend channels,</strong>&nbsp;sometimes also called&nbsp;<strong>price channels</strong>.</p>
    <p>Still, this doesn&rsquo;t mean that you should walk away like it&rsquo;s a commercial break. Channels can be just as exciting to watch as&nbsp;<em>Stranger Things</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>Keeping Up with the Kardashians</em>!</p>
    <p>Trend channels are just another tool in technical analysis that can be used to determine good places to buy or sell.</p>
    <p>The&nbsp;<strong>upper trend line marks resistance</strong>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<strong>lower trend line marks support</strong>. So both the tops and bottoms of channels represent potential areas of support or resistance.</p>
    <p>Trend channels with a&nbsp;<strong>negative slope</strong>&nbsp;(down) are considered&nbsp;<strong>bearish</strong>&nbsp;and those with a&nbsp;<strong>positive slope</strong>&nbsp;(up) are considered&nbsp;<strong>bullish.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>To create an up (ascending) channel</strong>, simply draw a parallel line at the same angle as an uptrend line and then move that line to a position where it touches the most recent peak. This should be done at the same time you create the trend line.</p>
    <p><strong>To create a down (descending) channel</strong>, simply draw a parallel line at the same angle as the downtrend line and then move that line to a position where it touches the most recent valley. This should be done at the same time you create the trend line.</p>
    <p>When prices hit the LOWER trend line, this may be used as a&nbsp;<strong>buying</strong>&nbsp;area.</p>
    <p>When prices hit the UPPER trend line, this may be used as a&nbsp;<strong>selling</strong>&nbsp;area.</p>
    <h2>Types of Trend Channels</h2>
    <p>There are three types of channels:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Ascending channel (higher highs and higher lows)</li>
    <li>Descending channel (lower highs and lower lows)</li>
    <li>Horizontal channel (ranging)</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Some traders prefer to use the terms &ldquo;rising channel&rdquo; for an ascending channel and &ldquo;falling channel&rdquo; for a descending channel. Most likely, Millenials.</p>
    <h2>Important things to remember about drawing trend channels:</h2>
    <p>When constructing a trend channel, both trend lines must be parallel to each other.</p>
    <p>Generally, the&nbsp;<strong>bottom</strong>&nbsp;of the trend channel is considered a &ldquo;<em>buy</em>&nbsp;zone&rdquo; while the&nbsp;<strong>top</strong>&nbsp;of the trend channel is considered a &ldquo;<em>sell</em>&nbsp;zone&rdquo;.</p>
    <p>Like in drawing trend lines,&nbsp;<strong>DO NOT EVER</strong>&nbsp;force the price to the channels that you draw!</p>
    <p>A channel boundary that is sloping at one angle while the corresponding channel boundary is sloping at a&nbsp;<em>different&nbsp;</em>angle is not correct and could lead to bad trades.</p>
    <p>When this happens, this chart pattern is no longer a trend channel but a triangle. (which you will learn about more later).</p>
    <p>That said, trend channels don&rsquo;t have to be&nbsp;<em>completely</em>&nbsp;parallel. Nor does 100% of price action have to fit within the channel.</p>
    <p>A common mistake many traders make is that they&nbsp;<strong>only look for textbook price patterns</strong>.</p>
    <p>They miss important information about price action and close their eyes to other important clues.</p>
    <p>Notice the channel drawings below&hellip;</p>

    <p>Do they look perfect?&nbsp;ðŸ‘€</p>
    <p>Waiting for picture-perfect textbook examples won&rsquo;t help you in the real world because it&rsquo;s going to be pretty rare to see price action that fits perfectly within two perfectly parallel trend lines.</p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s like trying to find the perfect man or woman in the real world. Once you find that person, don&rsquo;t let go.&nbsp;ðŸ˜­</p>
