    <p><strong>Trend lines</strong>&nbsp;are probably the most common form of technical analysis in forex trading.</p>
    <p>They are probably one of the most underutilized ones as well.</p>
    <p>If drawn correctly, they can be as accurate as any other method.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, most forex traders don&rsquo;t draw them correctly or try to make the line fit the market instead of the other way around.</p>

    <p>In their most basic form, an&nbsp;<strong>uptrend</strong>&nbsp;line is drawn along the bottom of easily identifiable support areas (valleys).</p>
    <p>This is known as an ascending trend line.</p>
    <p>In a&nbsp;<strong>downtrend</strong>, the trend line is drawn along the top of easily identifiable resistance areas (peaks).</p>
    <p>This is known as a descending trend line.</p>
    <h2>How do you draw trend lines?</h2>
    <p>To draw forex trend lines properly, all you have to do is locate two major tops or bottoms and connect them.</p>
    <p>What&rsquo;s next?</p>
    <p>Nothing.</p>
    <p>Uhh, is that it?</p>
    <p>Yep, it&rsquo;s that simple.</p>
    <p>Here are trend lines in action! Look at those waves!</p>

    <h2>Types of Trends</h2>
    <p>There are three types of trends:</p>
    <ol>
    <li><strong>Uptrend</strong>&nbsp;(higher lows)</li>
    <li><strong>Downtrend</strong>&nbsp;(lower highs)</li>
    <li><strong>Sideways trend</strong>&nbsp;(ranging)</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Here are some important things to remember using&nbsp;trend lines in forex trading:</h2>
    <p>It takes at least&nbsp;<em>two</em>&nbsp;tops or bottoms to draw a valid trend line but it takes THREE to confirm a trend line.</p>
    <p>The STEEPER the trend line you draw, the less reliable it is going to be and the more likely it will break.</p>
    <p>Like horizontal support and resistance levels, trend lines become stronger&nbsp;<strong>the more times they are tested</strong>.</p>
    <p>And most importantly,&nbsp;<strong>DO NOT EVER</strong>&nbsp;draw trend lines by forcing them to fit the market. If they do not fit right, then that trend line isn&rsquo;t a valid one!</p>
