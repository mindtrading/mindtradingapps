    <p>In the previous lessons, you learned about<strong>&nbsp;trading support and resistance</strong>.</p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s review what you&rsquo;ve learned.</p>
    <p>When the price moves up and then pulls back, the highest point reached before it pulls back is now&nbsp;<strong>resistance</strong>.</p>
    <p>As the price continues up again, the lowest point reached before it climbs back up&nbsp;is now&nbsp;<strong>support</strong>.</p>
    <h2>Support and Resistance are Zones</h2>
    <p>One thing to remember is that support and resistance&nbsp;levels&nbsp;<strong>are usually not exact numbers.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>To help you filter out these false breakouts, you should think of support and resistance more as &ldquo;zones&rdquo; rather than concrete numbers.</strong></p>
    <p>One way to help you find these zones is to plot support and resistance on a&nbsp;<strong>line chart</strong>&nbsp;rather than a candlestick chart.</p>
    <h2>Support and Resistance Can Reverse Roles</h2>
    <p>Another thing to remember is that when price passes through a resistance level, that&nbsp;<strong>resistance could potentially become support</strong>.</p>

    <p>The same could also happen with a support level.&nbsp;<strong>If a support level is broken, it could potentially become a resistance level</strong></p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2015/03/13193612/support-turned-resistance-role-reversal.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>This concept is known as &ldquo;<strong>role reversal</strong>&ldquo;.</p>
    <h2>Trend Lines</h2>
    <p>In their most basic form, an uptrend line is drawn along the bottom of easily identifiable support areas (valleys).</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2015/03/09010924/bullish-trendline.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>In a downtrend, the trend line is drawn along the top of easily identifiable resistance areas (peaks).</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2015/03/09010923/bearish-trendline.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>There are three types of trends:</p>
    <ol>
    <li><strong>Uptrend</strong>&nbsp;(higher lows)</li>
    <li><strong>Downtrend</strong>&nbsp;(lower highs)</li>
    <li><strong>Sideways</strong>&nbsp;or trendless (ranging or flat)</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Trend Channels</h2>
    <p>There are three types of trend channels:</p>
    <ol>
    <li><strong>Ascending channel</strong>&nbsp;(higher highs and higher lows)</li>
    <li><strong>Descending channel</strong>&nbsp;(lower highers and lower lows)</li>
    <li><strong>Horizontal channel</strong>&nbsp;(ranging)</li>
    </ol>
    <p>To create an&nbsp;<strong>up</strong>&nbsp;(ascending) channel, simply draw a parallel line at the same angle as an uptrend line and then move that line to a&nbsp;position where it touches the most recent peak.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2015/03/08231259/ascending-channel.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>To create a&nbsp;<strong>down</strong>&nbsp;(descending) channel, simply draw a parallel line at the same angle as the downtrend line and then move that line to a position where it touches the most recent valley.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2015/03/09012421/descending-channel1.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>To create a&nbsp;<strong>sideways</strong>&nbsp;(horizontal) channel, simply draw a parallel line at a zero or flat angle.</p>
    <h2>How to Trade Support and Resistance</h2>
    <p>Trading support and resistance levels can be divided into two methods</p>
    <ol>
    <li>The &ldquo;<strong>bounce</strong>&ldquo;</li>
    <li>The &ldquo;<strong>break</strong>&ldquo;</li>
    </ol>
    <p>When trading&nbsp;<strong>the bounce</strong>&nbsp;we want to tilt the odds in our favor and find some sort of confirmation that the support or resistance will hold.</p>
    <p>Instead of simply buying or selling right off the bat, wait for it to bounce first before entering.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2020/05/17214040/falling-knife-lesson-150x150.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>By doing this, you avoid those moments where price moves so fast that it slices through support and resistance levels like a knife slicing through warm butter.</p>
    <p>Or your warm hand.</p>
    <p>As for trading&nbsp;<strong>the break</strong>, there is an&nbsp;<em>aggressive</em>&nbsp;way and there is a&nbsp;<em>conservative</em>&nbsp;way.</p>
    <p>In the aggressive way, you simply buy or sell whenever the price passes through a support or resistance zone with ease.</p>

    <p>In the conservative way, you wait for the price to make a &ldquo;pullback&rdquo; to the broken support or resistance level and enter after the price bounces.</p>
