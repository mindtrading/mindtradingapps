    <p><strong>&ldquo;Support and resistance&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;is one of the most widely used concepts in trading.</p>
    <p>Strangely enough, everyone seems to have their own idea of how you should measure support and resistance.</p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at the basics first.</p>
    <p><img title="Forex Support and Resistance Explained" src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade1-support-resistance-basics.png" alt="Forex Support and Resistance Explained" width="525" height="285" border="0" /></p>
    <p>Look at the diagram above. As you can see, this zigzag pattern is making its way up (a &ldquo;bull market&rdquo;).</p>
    <p>When the price moves up and then pulls back, the highest point reached before it pulled back is now&nbsp;<strong>resistance</strong>.</p>
    <p>Resistance levels indicate where there will be a&nbsp;<strong>surplus of&nbsp;<em>sellers</em></strong>.</p>
    <p>When the price continues up again, the lowest point reached before it started back is now&nbsp;<strong>support</strong>.</p>
    <p>Support levels indicate where there will be a&nbsp;<strong>surplus of&nbsp;<em>buyers</em></strong>.</p>
    <p>In this way, resistance and support are continually formed as the price moves up and down over time.</p>
    <p>The reverse is true during a&nbsp;<strong>downtrend</strong>.</p>
    <p>In the most basic way, this is how support and resistance are normally traded:</p>
    <p><strong>Trade the &ldquo;Bounce&rdquo;</strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li>Buy when the price falls towards support.</li>
    <li>Sell when the price rises towards resistance.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Trade the &ldquo;Break&rdquo;</strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li>Buy when the price breaks up through resistance.</li>
    <li>Sell when the price breaks down through support.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A &ldquo;bounce&rdquo; and &ldquo;break&rdquo;? Say what? If you&rsquo;re a little bit confused, no need to worry as we will cover these concepts in more detail later.</p>
    <h2>Plotting Support and Resistance Levels</h2>
    <p>One thing to remember is that support and resistance levels are&nbsp;<strong>not exact numbers</strong>.</p>
    <p>Often times you will see a support or resistance level that appears broken, but soon after find out that the market was just testing it.</p>
    <p>With candlestick charts, these &ldquo;tests&rdquo; of support and resistance are usually represented by the candlestick&nbsp;<strong>shadows</strong>.</p>
    <p><img title="Forex Support and Resistance | Support holding at 1.4700" src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade1-support-before-thumbnail.png" alt="Forex Support and Resistance | Support holding at 1.4700" width="525" height="298" border="0" /></p>
    <p>Notice how the shadows of the candles tested the 1.4700 support level.</p>
    <p>At those times it seemed like the price was &ldquo;breaking&rdquo; support.</p>
    <p>In hindsight, we can see that the price was merely&nbsp;<em>testing</em>&nbsp;that level.</p>
    <h2>So how do we truly know if support and resistance were broken?</h2>
    <p>There is no definite answer to this question.</p>
    <p>Some argue that a support or resistance level is broken if the price can actually close past that level.</p>
    <p>However, you will find that&nbsp;<strong>this is not always the case</strong>.</p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s take our same example from above and see what happened when the price actually closed past the 1.4700 support level.</p>
    <p><img title="Forex Support and Resistance | Support holds at 1.4700" src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade1-support-after-thumbnail.png" alt="Forex Support and Resistance | Support holds at 1.4700" width="525" height="298" border="0" /></p>
    <p>In this case, the price had closed below the 1.4700 support level but ended up rising back up above it.</p>
    <p>If you had believed that this was a real breakout and sold this pair, you would&rsquo;ve been seriously hurtin&rsquo;!</p>
    <p>Looking at the chart now, you can visually see and come to the conclusion that the support was not actually broken; it is still very much intact and now even stronger.</p>
    <p>Support was &ldquo;breached&rdquo; but only temporarily.</p>
    <p><strong>To help you filter out these false breakouts, you should think of support and resistance more as &ldquo;zones&rdquo; rather than concrete numbers.</strong></p>
    <p>One way to help you find these zones is to plot support and resistance on a line chart rather than a candlestick chart.</p>
    <p>The reason is that line charts only show you the&nbsp;<strong>closing price</strong>&nbsp;while candlesticks add extreme highs and lows to the picture.</p>
    <p>These highs and lows can be misleading because oftentimes they are just the &ldquo;knee-jerk&rdquo; reactions of the market.</p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s like when someone is doing something really strange, but when asked about it, he or she simply replies, &ldquo;Sorry, it&rsquo;s just a reflex.&rdquo;</p>
    <p><strong>When plotting support and resistance, you don&rsquo;t want the reflexes of the market. You only want to plot its&nbsp;intentional&nbsp;movements.</strong></p>
    <p>Looking at the line chart, you want to plot your support and resistance lines around areas where you can see the price forming several&nbsp;<strong>peaks or valleys</strong>.</p>

    <h2>Other interesting tidbits about support and resistance:</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>When the price passes through resistance, that&nbsp;<strong>resistance could potentially become support</strong>.</li>
    <li>The more often price tests a level of resistance or support without breaking it, the&nbsp;<strong>stronger</strong>&nbsp;the area of resistance or support is.</li>
    <li>When a support or resistance level breaks, the&nbsp;<strong>strength of the follow-through move</strong>&nbsp;depends on how strongly the broken support or resistance had been holding.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>With a little practice, you&rsquo;ll be able to spot potential forex support and resistance areas easily.</p>
