    <p>A&nbsp;<strong>simple moving average</strong>&nbsp;(SMA) is the simplest type of moving average.</p>
    <p>Basically, a simple moving average is calculated by adding up the last &ldquo;X&rdquo; period&rsquo;s closing prices and then dividing that number by X.</p>
    <p>Confused???</p>
    <p>Don&rsquo;t worry, we&rsquo;ll make it crystal clear.</p>
    <h2>Calculating the Simple Moving Average (SMA)</h2>
    <p>If you plotted a 5 period simple moving average on a 1-hour chart, you would add up the closing prices for the last 5 hours, and then divide that number by 5.</p>
    <p>Voila! You have the average closing price over the last five hours! String those average prices together and you get a moving average!</p>
    <p>If you were to plot a 5 period simple moving average on a 30-minute chart, you would add up the closing prices of the last 150 minutes and then divide that number by 5.</p>
    <p>If you were to plot the 5-period simple moving average on the 4 hr. chart&hellip; Okay, okay, we know, we know. You get the picture!</p>
    <p>Most charting packages will do all the calculations for you.</p>
    <p>The reason we just bored you (yawn!) with a &ldquo;how to&rdquo; on calculating simple moving averages is that it&rsquo;s important to understand so that you know how to edit and tweak the indicator.</p>
    <p>Understanding how an indicator works means you can adjust and create different strategies as the market environment changes.</p>
    <p>Now, as with&nbsp;almost any other forex indicator out there, moving averages operate with a delay.</p>
    <p>Because you are taking the averages of past price history, you are really only seeing the general path of the recent past and the general direction of &ldquo;future&rdquo; short-term price action.</p>
    <p><strong>Disclaimer: Moving averages will not turn you into Ms. Cleo the psychic!</strong></p>
    <p>Here is an example of how moving averages smooth out the price action.</p>
    <p><img title=" Simple Moving Averages" src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade4-simple-moving-averages.png" alt="Simple Moving Averages" width="525" height="298" border="0" /></p>
    <p>On the chart above, we&rsquo;ve plotted three different SMAs on the 1-hour chart of USD/CHF. As you can see, the longer the SMA period is, the more it lags behind the price.</p>
    <p>Notice how the 62 SMA is farther away from the current price than the 30 and 5 SMAs.</p>
    <p>This is because the 62 SMA adds up the closing prices of the last 62 periods and divides it by 62.</p>
    <p>The longer period you use for the SMA, the slower it is to react to the price movement.</p>
    <p>The SMAs in this chart show you the overall sentiment of the market at this point in time. Here, we can see that the pair is trending.</p>
    <p>Instead of just looking at the current price of the market, the moving averages give us a broader view, and we can now gauge the general direction of its future price.</p>
    <p>With the use of SMAs, we can tell whether a pair is trending up, trending down, or just ranging.</p>
    <p>There is one problem with the simple moving average:&nbsp;<strong>they are susceptible to spikes</strong>.</p>
    <p>When this happens, this can give us&nbsp;<strong>false signals</strong>. We might think that a new currency trend may be developing but in reality, nothing changed.</p>
    <p>In the next lesson, we will show you what we mean, and also introduce you to another type of moving average to avoid this problem.</p>
