    <p>What are&nbsp;<strong>moving average envelopes?</strong></p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s rewind and briefly talk about moving averages first.</p>
    <p>The goal of using moving averages is to&nbsp;<strong>identify trend changes.</strong></p>
    <p>While moving averages are a useful tool to have in your technical analysis toolbox, they can be susceptible to&nbsp;<strong>providing false signals.</strong></p>
    <p>Like you&rsquo;ve learned in previous lessons on moving averages, a simple buy signal occurs when&nbsp;<strong>prices close&nbsp;<em>above</em>&nbsp;the moving average</strong>.</p>
    <p>And a simple sell signal occurs when the<strong>&nbsp;price closes&nbsp;<em>below</em>&nbsp;the moving average</strong>.</p>
    <p>For example, let&rsquo;s say EUR/USD is moving upward and closes above a moving average, signaling an entry to go long.</p>
    <p>How do you know that this bullish trend is &ldquo;real&rdquo; and will continue?</p>
    <p>You don&rsquo;t.</p>
    <p>So assuming you still want to go long, you have two options:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Go long now based on the original entry signal (price closed above MA)</li>
    <li>Wait for more&nbsp;<strong>confirmation</strong>&nbsp;that the trend is legit.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>This is where&nbsp;<strong>moving averages envelopes</strong>&nbsp;(MAE) can help.</p>
    <p>Huh? Moving average&nbsp;<em>envelopes</em>?</p>
    <p>Like this?</p>

    <p>No, not that kind of&nbsp;<em>envelopes</em>.</p>
    <h2>What are Moving Average Envelopes?</h2>
    <p>A moving average envelope consists of a&nbsp;<strong>moving average AND two other lines</strong>.</p>
    <p>One line is ABOVE the moving average and the other line is BELOW the moving average.</p>
    <p><strong>Together, these two lines form an upper and lower envelope.</strong></p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2020/04/04172329/moving-average-envelope-example-780x333.png" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" srcset="https://bpcdn.co/images/2020/04/04172329/moving-average-envelope-example-780x333.png 780w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2020/04/04172329/moving-average-envelope-example-768x328.png 768w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2020/04/04172329/moving-average-envelope-example-1200x512.png 1200w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2020/04/04172329/moving-average-envelope-example-360x154.png 360w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2020/04/04172329/moving-average-envelope-example.png 1384w" alt="Moving Average Envelopes Example" width="780" height="333" /></p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s called an envelope (noun) because these two lines&nbsp;<em>envelope</em>&nbsp;(verb) the original moving average line.</p>
    <p>Moving averages envelopes are used to:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Confirm&nbsp;<strong>trend</strong></li>
    <li>Identify&nbsp;<strong>overbought and oversold conditions</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How to Calculate Moving Average Envelopes</h2>
    <p>How to calculate a moving average envelope is pretty simple.</p>
    <p>First, decide whether you want to use a simple moving average<strong>&nbsp;(SMA)</strong>&nbsp;or exponential moving average<strong>&nbsp;(EMA)</strong>.</p>
    <p>Remember, EMAs have less lag because they put more weight on recent prices.</p>
    <p>Then, select the number of time periods you wish to apply.</p>
    <p>Lastly, set the percentage value you&rsquo;d like to use for the envelopes.</p>
    <p>For example, a 10-day moving average with a 1% envelope would show the following lines:</p>
    <pre><strong>Upper Envelope:</strong> 10-day SMA + (10-day SMA x .01)
    <strong>10-day SMA</strong>
    <strong>Lower Envelope:</strong> 10-day SMA - (10-day SMA x .01)</pre>
    <p>The chart below shows EUR/USD with a&nbsp;<strong>10-day SMA and 1% envelopes</strong>.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2020/04/04173826/moving-average-envelopes-EURUSD-780x401.png" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" srcset="https://bpcdn.co/images/2020/04/04173826/moving-average-envelopes-EURUSD-780x401.png 780w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2020/04/04173826/moving-average-envelopes-EURUSD-768x395.png 768w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2020/04/04173826/moving-average-envelopes-EURUSD-1200x617.png 1200w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2020/04/04173826/moving-average-envelopes-EURUSD-360x185.png 360w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2020/04/04173826/moving-average-envelopes-EURUSD.png 1452w" alt="EURUSD with Moving Average Envelopes" width="780" height="401" /></p>
    <p>Notice how the envelopes (blue lines) move parallel with the 10-day SMA (orange line).</p>
    <p>They remain a&nbsp;<strong>constant</strong>&nbsp;1% above and below the moving average (orange line).</p>
    <h2>How to Confirm Trend Direction with Moving Average Envelopes</h2>
    <p>Since the foundation of moving average envelopes (MAE) is the moving average, this means that the moving average envelopes can be used as a trend-following indicator.</p>
    <p><strong>The direction of the&nbsp;<em>moving averag</em>e determines the direction of the&nbsp;<em>envelopes</em>.</strong></p>
    <p>When the envelopes are moving higher, the price is in an&nbsp;<strong>uptrend</strong>.</p>
    <p>When the envelopes are moving lower, the price is in a&nbsp;<strong>downtrend</strong>.</p>
    <p>When the envelopes are moving sideways, the price is neither in an uptrend or downtrend. The trend is neutral and the price is considered directionless.</p>
    <p>You should pay attention&nbsp;<strong>when the price moves above or below the envelopes</strong>.</p>
    <p>Since trends often begin with a strong move, if the price surges above the upper envelope, this is considered&nbsp;<strong>bullish</strong>.</p>
    <p>If the price plunges below the lower envelope, this is considered&nbsp;<strong>bearish</strong>.</p>
    <h3>Buy Signal</h3>
    <p>If the price closes&nbsp;<em>above</em>&nbsp;the UPPER envelope,&nbsp;<strong>buy</strong>.</p>
    <h3>Sell Signal</h3>
    <p>If the price closes&nbsp;<em>below</em>&nbsp;the LOWER envelope,&nbsp;<strong>sell</strong>.</p>
    <h3>Example: GBP/USD</h3>
    <p>In the chart below, notice how the 20-day simple moving average (orange line) and the upper and lower envelopes (blue lines) are moving higher.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2020/04/04182540/moving-average-envelopes-GBPUSD-780x401.png" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" srcset="https://bpcdn.co/images/2020/04/04182540/moving-average-envelopes-GBPUSD-780x401.png 780w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2020/04/04182540/moving-average-envelopes-GBPUSD-768x395.png 768w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2020/04/04182540/moving-average-envelopes-GBPUSD-1200x617.png 1200w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2020/04/04182540/moving-average-envelopes-GBPUSD-360x185.png 360w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2020/04/04182540/moving-average-envelopes-GBPUSD.png 1452w" alt="Moving Average Envelope Example GBPUSD" width="780" height="401" /></p>
    <p>See how the price managed to close above the moving average?</p>
    <p>To confirm that the trend has changed from bearish to bullish, you could wait until the price has also closed above the upper envelope.</p>
    <h2>How to Identify Overbought and Oversold Levels with Moving Average Envelopes</h2>
    <p>There will also be times when the price initially moves above or below an envelope but turns back around.</p>
    <p>This usually happens when the moving average slope is FLAT.</p>
    <p>When this happens, moving average envelopes can be used to identify overbought and oversold levels.</p>
    <p>When the price moves above the upper envelope, this can be considered&nbsp;<strong>overbought</strong>.</p>
    <p>When the price moves below the lower envelope, this can be considered&nbsp;<strong>oversold</strong>.</p>
    <p>Identifying overbought and oversold levels isn&rsquo;t easy though.</p>
    <p>Remember, a currency pair&nbsp;can become overbought and&nbsp;<em>remain</em>&nbsp;overbought when the bullish trend is strong.</p>
    <p>The same goes for being oversold. In a strong bearish trend, something can be technically oversold, but&nbsp;<em>remain</em>&nbsp;oversold for quite some time.</p>
    <p>This is why it&rsquo;s best to pay attention to the&nbsp;<strong>slope of the moving average</strong>&nbsp;and make sure it&rsquo;s&nbsp;<strong>flat</strong>.</p>
    <p>You should confirm overbought and oversold levels with support and resistance levels.</p>
    <h3>Buy Signal</h3>
    <p>If price touches or falls beneath the LOWER envelope, then rises back above,&nbsp;<strong>buy</strong>.</p>
    <h3>Sell Signal</h3>
    <p>If price touches or rises above the UPPER envelope, then falls back below,&nbsp;<strong>sell</strong>.</p>
    <h3>Example: EUR/JPY</h3>
    <p>In the chart below, notice how the 30 SMA (orange line) and the upper and lower envelopes (blue lines) are flat&hellip;almost horizontal even.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2020/04/04184220/moving-average-envelopes-as-support-resistance-EURJPY-780x401.png" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" srcset="https://bpcdn.co/images/2020/04/04184220/moving-average-envelopes-as-support-resistance-EURJPY-780x401.png 780w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2020/04/04184220/moving-average-envelopes-as-support-resistance-EURJPY-768x395.png 768w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2020/04/04184220/moving-average-envelopes-as-support-resistance-EURJPY-1200x617.png 1200w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2020/04/04184220/moving-average-envelopes-as-support-resistance-EURJPY-360x185.png 360w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2020/04/04184220/moving-average-envelopes-as-support-resistance-EURJPY.png 1452w" alt="Moving Average Envelope as Support and Resistance" width="780" height="401" /></p>
    <p>EUR/JPY is directionless here. There is no strong bullish trend, nor is there a strong bearish trend.</p>
    <p>Observe how the upper envelope acts as a strong resistance level.</p>
    <p>Whenever price traded near the upper envelope, the price would fall back down.</p>
    <p>The same with the lower envelope. Observe how it acts as a strong support level.</p>
    <p>Whenever price traded near the lower envelope, the price would bounce back up.</p>
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>Moving average envelopes (MAE) are used as a tool to&nbsp;<strong>confirm trend direction</strong>, but can also be used in sideways markets to&nbsp;<strong>identify overbought and oversold levels</strong>.</p>
