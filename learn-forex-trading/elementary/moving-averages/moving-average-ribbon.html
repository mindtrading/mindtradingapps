    <p>What is a&nbsp;<strong>moving average ribbon</strong>?</p>
    <p>A moving average ribbon is a<strong>&nbsp;series of moving averages of different lengths</strong>&nbsp;plotted on a chart.</p>
    <p>The basic idea behind the concept of &ldquo;moving average ribbons&rdquo; is that instead of using one or two moving averages on a chart, you are using a&nbsp;<em>bunch</em>&nbsp;of moving averages, usually between 6 to 16 moving averages (or more).</p>
    <p>All on the same chart.</p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at an example&hellip;</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2020/03/31174646/moving-average-ribbon-usdchf-example-780x529.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>Traders can determine the&nbsp;<strong>strength of a trend</strong>&nbsp;by looking at the smoothness of the ribbon, as well as identify key areas of support or resistance by looking at the price in relation to the ribbon.</p>
    <h2>How to Set Up a Moving Average Ribbon</h2>
    <p>A common question is &ldquo;How many moving averages do I use?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>It really depends on the trader.</p>
    <p>Some traders like to use&nbsp;<strong>six to eight</strong>&nbsp;simple moving averages (SMA) set at 10-period intervals, such as the 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60-day SMAs.</p>
    <p>Other traders like to set up with SIXTEEN (or more) simple moving averages&nbsp;varying from a 50-day to a 200-day SMA and everything in between.</p>
    <p>The argument for using longer-term MAs is that it gives a more accurate look at the overall trend.</p>
    <p>Then other traders like to use exponential moving averages instead of simple moving averages.</p>
    <p>So it&rsquo;s really a matter of preference.</p>
    <p>The responsiveness of the moving average ribbon can be adjusted by:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Changing the<strong>&nbsp;number of time periods</strong>&nbsp;used in the moving average</li>
    <li>Changing the&nbsp;<strong>type of moving average</strong>&nbsp;from a simple moving average (SMA) to an exponential moving average (EMA)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The&nbsp;<em>shorter</em>&nbsp;the number of periods used when selecting which MAs to add to your chart, the more&nbsp;<em>sensitive</em>&nbsp;the moving average ribbon is to slight price changes.</p>
    <p>Using moving averages&nbsp;with larger numbers of periods (like 200) are less sensitive and smoother.</p>
    <h2>How to Trade with Moving Average Ribbons</h2>
    <h3>1. An EXPANDING moving average ribbon signals the potential end of a trend.</h3>
    <p>When the moving averages start widening out and separating, also known as ribbon &ldquo;expansion&rdquo;, this signals that that recent price direction has reached an&nbsp;<em>extreme&nbsp;</em>and could be the&nbsp;<strong>end of a trend</strong>.</p>
    <p>Think of each moving average as a magnet and they&rsquo;re attracted to each other.</p>
    <p>They do not want to be too far apart from each other for too long. So when they are, they will want to close that distance.</p>
    <h3>2. A CONTRACTING moving average ribbon signals a possible change in trend.</h3>
    <p>When the moving averages start to converge and get closer to each other, also known as ribbon &ldquo;contraction&rdquo;, a<strong>&nbsp;trend change has possibly started</strong>.</p>
    <p>After an extreme move in price in one direction, you will notice shorter-term moving averages converge&nbsp;<em>first</em>. The longer-term moving averages will slowly converge.</p>
    <h3>3. A PARALLEL moving average ribbon signals a strong trend.</h3>
    <p>When the moving average ribbons are parallel and evenly spaced, this means that the&nbsp;<strong>current trend is strong</strong>.</p>
    <p>All the moving averages are in &ldquo;agreement&rdquo; since they are moving together.</p>
    <h2>Keep an Eye on the&nbsp;<em>Spacing</em>&nbsp;Between the Moving Averages</h2>
    <p>Some traders make the mistake of only paying attention when the moving averages &ldquo;cross over&rdquo; or &ldquo;twist&rdquo;.</p>
    <p>While it is important to monitor when the short-term moving averages cross above (or below) the long-term moving averages, it&rsquo;s also important to monitor the SPACING between the moving averages.</p>
    <p>The&nbsp;<strong>positioning</strong>&nbsp;of short-term moving averages relative to long-term moving average shows the DIRECTION of the trend (down, neutral, up).</p>
    <p>The&nbsp;<strong>spacing</strong>&nbsp;between the moving averages shows the STRENGTH of the trend (weak, neutral, strong).</p>
    <h2>Moving Average Ribbon Example</h2>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at a moving average ribbon applied to GBP/USD&nbsp;on a 1-hour chart.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2020/03/31181928/moving-average-ribbon-gbpusd-780x552.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>Can you see the trend changes?</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2020/03/31182048/moving-average-ribbon-gbpusd-labeled-780x552.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>In the chart above, you can easily identify bullish or bearish trends by looking at when the moving averages start to cross over or &ldquo;twist&rdquo; lower or higher.</p>
    <p><strong>Ribbon expansion</strong>&nbsp;or the widening of spacing between the moving averages suggests the&nbsp;<em>end of the current trend</em>.</p>
    <p><strong>Ribbon contraction</strong>&nbsp;or the narrowing of spacing between the moving averages suggests&nbsp;<em>the start of a new trend</em>.</p>
