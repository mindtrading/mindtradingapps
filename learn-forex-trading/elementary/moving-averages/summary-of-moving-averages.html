    <p>There are many types of moving averages.</p>
    <p>The two most common types are a&nbsp;<strong>simple moving average and an exponential moving average</strong>.</p>
    <p><strong>Simple moving averages</strong>&nbsp;are the simplest form of moving averages, slow but smooth.</p>
    <p><strong>Exponential moving averages</strong>&nbsp;put more weight on recent prices, which means they place more emphasis on what traders are doing now.</p>
    <p>It is much more important to know what traders are doing now than to see what they did last week or last month.</p>
    <p>Simple moving averages are&nbsp;<em>smoother</em>&nbsp;than exponential moving averages.</p>
    <p>Longer period moving averages are smoother than shorter period moving averages.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Using the exponential moving average can help you&nbsp;<strong>spot a trend faster</strong>, but is prone to many fake outs.</p>
    <p>Simple moving averages are slower to respond to price action but will&nbsp;<strong>save you from spikes and fake outs</strong>.</p>
    <p>However, because of their slow reaction, they can delay you from taking a trade and may cause you to miss some good opportunities.</p>
    <p>You can use moving averages to help you define the trend, when to enter, and when the trend is coming to an end.</p>
    <p>Moving averages can be used as&nbsp;<strong>dynamic support and resistance levels</strong>.</p>
    <p>One of the best ways to use moving averages is to&nbsp;<strong>plot different types</strong>&nbsp;so that you can see both long-term movement and short-term movement.</p>
    <p>You got all of that? Why don&rsquo;t you open up your charting software and try popping up some moving averages?</p>
    <p>Remember, using moving averages is simple. The hard part is determining which one to use!</p>
    <p>That&rsquo;s why you should try them out and figure out which best fits your style of trading. Maybe you prefer a trend-following system. Or maybe you want&nbsp;to use them as dynamic support and resistance.</p>
    <p>Whatever you choose to do, make sure you read up and do some testing to see how it fits into your overall trading plan.</p>
