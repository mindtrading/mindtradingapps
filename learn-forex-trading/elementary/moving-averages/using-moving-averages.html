    <p>One sweet way to use moving averages&nbsp;is to help you&nbsp;<strong>determine the trend</strong>.</p>
    <p>The simplest way is to just&nbsp;<strong>plot a single moving average on the chart</strong>.</p>
    <p>When price action tends to stay above the moving average, it signals that price is in a general&nbsp;<strong>UPTREND.</strong></p>
    <p>If price action tends to stay below the moving average, then it indicates that it is in a&nbsp;<strong>DOWNTREND.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>The problem with this is that it&rsquo;s too simplistic.</strong></p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s say that USD/JPY has been in a downtrend, but a news report comes out causing it to surge higher.</p>
    <p><img title="Moving average shows a downtrend" src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade4-ma-fake.png" alt="Moving average shows a downtrend" width="525" height="298" /></p>
    <p>You see that the price is now ABOVE the moving average. You think to yourself:</p>
    <p>&ldquo;<strong>Hmmm&hellip; It looks like this pair is about to shift direction. Time to buy this suckerrrr!</strong>&rdquo;</p>
    <p>So you do just that. You buy a billion units cause you&rsquo;re confident that USD/JPY is going to go up.</p>
    <p><img title="Fakeout! Downtrend continues!" src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade4-ma-fake2.png" alt="Fakeout! Downtrend continues!" width="525" height="298" /></p>
    <p>Bammm! You get faked out!</p>
    <p>As it turns out, traders just reacted to the news but the trend continued and the price kept heading lower!</p>
    <p>What some traders do, and what we suggest you do as well, is that they&nbsp;<strong>plot a couple of moving averages on their charts instead of just ONE</strong>.</p>
    <p>This gives them a clearer signal of whether the pair is trending up or down depending on the order of the moving averages.</p>
    <p>Let us explain.</p>
    <p>In an uptrend, the &ldquo;faster&rdquo; moving average should be above the &ldquo;slower&rdquo; moving average, and for a downtrend, vice versa.</p>
    <p>For example, let&rsquo;s say we have two MAs: the 10-period MA and the 20-period MA. On your chart, it would look like this:</p>
    <p><img title="Faster moving average above slower moving average" src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade4-moving-average-trend.png" alt="Faster moving average above slower moving average" width="525" height="298" /></p>
    <p>Above is a daily chart of&nbsp;<strong>USD/JPY</strong>.</p>
    <p>Throughout the uptrend, the 10 SMA is above the 20 SMA.</p>
    <p>As you can see, you can use moving averages to help show whether a pair is trending up or down.</p>
    <p>By combining this with your knowledge of trend lines, this can help you decide whether to go long or short a currency pair.</p>
    <p>You can also try putting more than&nbsp;<strong>two moving averages</strong>&nbsp;on your chart.</p>
    <p>Just as long as lines are in order (faster MA over slower MA in an uptrend, slower MA over faster MA in a&nbsp;downtrend), then you can tell whether the pair is in an uptrend or in a downtrend.</p>
