    <p>So far, you have learned how to determine the trend by plotting some moving averages on your charts.</p>
    <p>You should also know that moving averages can help you determine&nbsp;<strong>when a trend is about to end and reverse</strong>.</p>
    <p>As trend traders, you want to recognize and ride the trend for as long as possible.</p>
    <p>You have to know&nbsp;<strong>when to get in</strong>&nbsp;AND&nbsp;<strong>when to get out</strong>.</p>
    <p>A trend can be defined simply as the general direction of the price over the short, immediate, or long term.</p>
    <p>Some trends are short-lived, while others last for days, weeks, or even months.</p>
    <p>But you don&rsquo;t necessarily know how long a specific trend will last.</p>
    <p>A technical tool known as a&nbsp;<strong>moving average&nbsp;crossover</strong>&nbsp;can help you identify when to get in and out.</p>
    <p>A moving average crossover occurs when&nbsp;<strong>two different moving average lines cross over one another</strong></p>
    <p>Because moving averages are a lagging indicator, the crossover technique may not capture exact tops and bottoms. But it can help you identify the&nbsp;<strong>bulk of a trend</strong>.</p>
    <p>A moving average crossover system helps to answer these three questions:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Which direction might the price be trending (if at all)?</li>
    <li>Where might be a potential entry point for a trend trade?</li>
    <li>When might a trend be ending or reversing?</li>
    </ol>
    <p>All you have to do is plop on a couple of moving averages on your chart, and wait for a crossover.</p>
    <p><strong>If the moving averages cross over one another, it could signal that the trend is about to change soon</strong>, thereby giving you the chance to get a better entry. By having a better entry, you have the chance to bag mo&rsquo; pips!</p>
    <p>If Allen Iverson&nbsp;made a living by having a killer crossover move, why can&rsquo;t you?</p>

    <p>Let&rsquo;s take another look at that daily chart of USD/JPY to&nbsp;help explain moving average crossover trading.</p>
    <p><img title="Moving average crossovers can signal change in trend " src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade4-moving-average-crossover.png" alt="Moving average crossovers can signal change in trend " width="525" height="298" border="0" /></p>
    <p>From around April to July, the pair was in a nice uptrend. It topped out at around 124.00, before slowly heading down. In the middle of July, we see that the 10 SMA crossed below the 20 SMA.</p>
    <p>And what happened next?</p>
    <p>A nice downtrend!</p>
    <p>If you had shorted at the crossover of the moving averages you would have made yourself almost a thousand pips!</p>
    <p>Of course, not every trade will be a thousand-pip winner, a hundred-pip winner, or even a 10-pip winner.</p>
    <p>It could be a loser, which means you have to consider things like where to place your stop loss or when to take profits. You just can&rsquo;t jump in without a plan!</p>
    <p>What some traders do is that they close out their position once a new crossover has been made or once the price has moved against the position a predetermined amount of pips.</p>
    <p>This is what Huck does in her HLHB system. She either exits when a new crossover has been made but also has a 150-pip stop loss just in case.</p>
    <p>The reason for this is you just don&rsquo;t know when the next crossover will be. You may end up hurting yourself if you wait too long!</p>
    <p>One thing to take note of with a crossover system is that while they work beautifully in a volatile and/or trending environment, they don&rsquo;t work so well when price is ranging.</p>
    <p>You will get hit with tons of crossover signals and you could find yourself getting stopped out multiple times before you catch a trend again.</p>
    <p>In summary,&nbsp;<strong>moving average crossovers are helpful in identifying when a trend might be emerging or when a trend might be ending</strong>.</p>
    <p>The crossover system offers specific triggers for&nbsp;<strong>potential entry and exit points</strong>.</p>
    <p>These triggers should be confirmed with a chart pattern or support and resistance breakouts (which you&rsquo;ll learn about later in the School).</p>
