    <p>Ask any quant on Wall Street (the super geeky math and physics PhDs who create complex algorithmic trading strategies) why there is no &ldquo;<strong>holy grail</strong>&rdquo; indicator, method, or system to pull profits 100% of the time.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/graduation-holy-cow.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>You will probably be given two reasons:</p>
    <h2>1. You can&rsquo;t predict the future.</h2>
    <p>Is there any way to know what a central bank head will say during a speech?</p>
    <p>Or maybe what a super famous investor or hedge fund manager says during a random TV interview?</p>
    <p>Do you know when the next terrorist attack will hit and cause risk aversion?</p>
    <p>How about a natural disaster like an earthquake or tsunami?</p>
    <p>The list of unforeseen market-moving catalysts is infinite and when they happen, they can rock the markets and your forex trading system.</p>
    <p>Understand that this is part of trading and the best you can do is be prepared to limit your losses if they occur.</p>
    <p>Be ready to have your world rocked. And we don&rsquo;t mean that in the way you think it means.</p>
    <h2>2. Data doesn&rsquo;t move the market. Humans do.</h2>
    <p>There will be times when data or market themes do not mesh with price action.</p>
    <p>Why is that?</p>
    <p>Maybe the outcome was priced in ahead of time? Maybe forex traders weren&rsquo;t focused on the data that was released?</p>
    <p>Maybe there was an institution covering a huge position that was on the wrong side of the market?</p>
    <p>Would all players in the market react to an unforeseen catalyst the same way?</p>
    <p>Whatever the price behavior may be, the decisions that lead a trader to take action aren&rsquo;t always logical or congruent to the information out there.</p>
    <p>When you multiply this by the millions of players with different goals/strategies and different sized trading accounts, it becomes impossible to tell where the overall market will go every single time.</p>
    <p>You can&rsquo;t quantify or calculate human behavior and unknown future events into an elegant mathematical equation to completely get rid of risk.</p>
    <p>There will always be some level of uncertainty and there will be times when you will be on the wrong side of a currency market move.</p>
    <p>Actually&hellip;.there will be MANY times when you will be on the wrong side of a&nbsp;currency market move.</p>
    <p>Perfectionists should probably stay away.</p>
    <p>For those of you who always feel the need to be correct, we must warn you now&hellip;</p>
    <p><strong>Nobody can perfectly predict the market every single time.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Nobody.</strong></p>
    <p>All hope is not lost though if you decide to stubbornly not listen and continue your search for the Holy Grail.</p>
    <p>Rumor has it that if you can find a pink unicorn standing under a rainbow, you will come across an invisible leprechaun who will give you the Holy Grail. Good luck.</p>
