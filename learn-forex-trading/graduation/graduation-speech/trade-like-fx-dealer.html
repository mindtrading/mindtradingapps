    <p>Meet Arnold.</p>
    <p>Arnold is from Pipfornia and is a bodybuilder chef who trades.</p>
    <p>Like many other traders, he has a mechanical system based on breakouts.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2010/10/13221329/arnold-trader.png" />Arnold even has a special name for it: the Terminator System.</p>
    <p>He follows his system with rock-solid discipline (which is how he got his abs and bazooka biceps) and with no emotion.</p>
    <p>He hopes to terminate enough pips so that he can buy his own Harley Davidson and drive down Pip-nice Beach.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately for Arnold, despite following his game plan and not letting the markets get to him, he struggles to make consistent profits.</p>
    <h2>A&nbsp;typical scenario for Arnold</h2>
    <p>Arnold gets a buy signal from his Terminator System, as EUR/USD is breaking out of its current resistance level.</p>
    <p>He buys at the market.</p>
    <p>After being up a couple of pips, the price reverses and stops him out. Minutes later, he gets another signal. This time, it&rsquo;s to short EUR/USD.</p>
    <p>Like any good trader, Arnold follows his system faithfully and sells at market price.</p>
    <p>In just a few seconds, he&rsquo;s up 10 pips, and it looks like the pair is headed for more lows. Then, all of a sudden, the momentum is lost and the pair begins to consolidate.</p>
    <p>Another couple of minutes pass by&hellip; then suddenly, price reverses back up and hits Arnold&rsquo;s stop loss order&hellip;.but only to shoot down another 100 pips!</p>
    <p>He keeps telling himself, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Only if Arnold knew the simple truth&hellip;</p>
    <p><strong>It&rsquo;s a Zero-Sum Game!</strong></p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2010/10/13223810/zero-sum-scale.png" />As we&rsquo;ve said time and again, trading in the forex market&nbsp;is not an easy task.</p>
    <p>You can be the most disciplined trader, who always follows his trading plan, keeps within his risk management rules, but still see a majority of your trades be losers.</p>
    <p>What&rsquo;s worse is that after getting stopped out, you see price eventually go your way and hit your profit targets.</p>
    <p>One has to remember,&nbsp;<strong>forex trading is a zero-sum game</strong>.</p>
    <p>Whenever you put on a buy or sell order, there is&nbsp;SOMEONE OUT THERE TAKING THE OTHER SIDE OF YOUR TRADE.</p>
    <p><strong>Someone wins and someone loses.</strong></p>
    <p>Most of the time, the one who&rsquo;s taking these positions is a forex dealer.</p>
    <p><strong>Forex dealers are professional traders who take on the opposite positions of retail traders</strong>, thus providing the liquidity needed for the forex market to work efficiently.</p>
    <p>However, banks are in the business of making money as well, and dealers actually can earn tons of profit by quickly unloading their positions, making money via the spread.</p>
    <p>The truth is that forex dealers actually do win most of the time. And for this reason, you should try to trade like a dealer.</p>
    <p>You must be thinking&hellip; &ldquo;A dealer? I&rsquo;ve heard so many bad things about dealers &ndash; they never fill in me at the right price, the spreads are wack. Why the heck would I ever wanna be like one?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Well, to be honest, dealers are just like you, someone who&rsquo;s trying to make some moolah every time the market moves up or down.</p>
    <p>But because dealers have so many advantages (the spread, information on order flows, etc.),&nbsp;<strong>retail traders are at a major disadvantage.</strong></p>
    <p>If you know how dealers think and trade, then you can overcome these disadvantages and become profitable as well.</p>
