    <p>Unless you&rsquo;re a good lookin&rsquo; dude or gal who&rsquo;s trying to win over his or her crush,&nbsp;<strong>never make the first move</strong>.</p>
    <p>What we mean by this is that you shouldn&rsquo;t always jump in when you see the market moving so quickly.</p>
    <p><strong>Dealers know that about 80% of the time, markets are ranging.</strong></p>
    <p>This means that sharp and sudden moves are most likely to be faded. This represents a good opportunity for dealers to make some profits.</p>
    <p>First of all, why will it most likely be faded?</p>
    <p>Remember, dealers work for banks, so they&rsquo;ve got two &ldquo;advantages&rdquo; (more like tricks if you ask us!) up their sleeves.</p>
    <p>First, they can&nbsp;<strong>see the orders</strong>&nbsp;that retail traders have and want to take.</p>
    <p>Secondly, they&rsquo;ve got a ton of cash to help back them up and&nbsp;<strong>move the market</strong>.</p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at a chart to see how dealers can use these tricks to their advantage.</p>
    <p>Below is a 5-minute chart of EUR/USD. Here we see that the German ZEW economic sentiment index, a high impact report, has just been released.</p>
    <p>Retail traders are looking at their charts and see that EUR/USD is dropping, so they decide to get in on the action.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/graduation-eurusd-sellers-jump-in.png" /></p>
    <p>They figure, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s looking pretty good. EUR/USD just dropped 20 pips in the last 5 minutes!</p>
    <p>This will probably keep falling and test the daily low!&rdquo;</p>
    <p>But wait, that&rsquo;s what the average retail trader is thinking. What are dealers focusing on?</p>
    <p>Dealers know that the release of data normally causes spikes in price as traders are jumping in and out quickly.</p>
    <p>They also know that most of the time,&nbsp;<strong>the first move after a news event is a&nbsp;fakeout</strong>&nbsp;and that price normally REVERSES&nbsp;to levels before the data was released.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2010/10/13231056/stomp-ant.jpg" alt="" width="270" height="190" />What happens is that dealers, with the financial backing of their respective banks and hedge funds, will take on the opposite position and fade the move.</p>
    <p>And since their collective efforts (cough&hellip; money&hellip;) outnumber those of us retail traders, our positions get stomped on like little, little ants.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/graduation-eurusd-fading.png" /></p>
    <p>In the chart above, we see that the down move wasn&rsquo;t sustained. The dealers&rsquo; position is now pushing the price up to the point where&hellip;</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/graduation-eurusd-climbing.png" /></p>
    <p>&hellip;all of a sudden,&nbsp;<strong>the price reverses</strong>! And this is where the magic happens!</p>
    <p>Chances are most people had set their stops just above 1.2900.</p>
    <p>In order to reach those stops, dealers probably took more long positions using their own money in order to push the price up to those levels (we&rsquo;ll explain this more in detail later).</p>
    <p>Once retail traders saw that price was making a new daily high, they probably thought, &ldquo;Oh man, this baby is gonna keep trading higher! I need to buy, buy, buy!!! *click, click*&rdquo;.</p>
    <p>Now that retail traders have changed their mind and wanna buy EUR/USD, dealers can now take advantage yet again and close their former long positions, while making money off the spread! Ka-ching, ka-ching!</p>
    <p>But of course, the dealers, banks, and trading institutions are the true playas in the market!</p>
    <p>That&rsquo;s why they are called market makers &ndash; they make the market move!</p>
    <p>Once all those retail traders get in their long positions and place their stop orders below the 1.2900 resistance, dealers can once again make a run for those stops and make money off the spread!</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/graduation-eurusd-faded-again.png" /></p>
    <p>And will ya take a look at that! Price did trade a little bit higher, but then it faded and dipped back down under the 1.2900 handle.</p>
    <p>All those retail traders who decided to go long on the break for new highs probably had their stop losses hit.</p>
    <p>As it turns out, that 1.2900 resistance ended up holding the rest of the day.</p>
    <p>You can see here how dealers use their considerable advantage to move the markets in their favor!</p>
    <p>This is why you shouldn&rsquo;t always go and take the first move as chances are, you might just get caught in&nbsp;fakeout.</p>
