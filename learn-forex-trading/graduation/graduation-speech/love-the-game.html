    <p>In his prime, NBA legend Kobe Bryant MADE (not just attemtped)<strong>&nbsp;1,000 shots a day</strong>&nbsp;in practice to increase his chances of making the 20-30 shots a game he takes.</p>
    <p>Along with team practice, Peyton Manning&nbsp;(NFL legend) watched&nbsp;<strong>hours and hours</strong>&nbsp;of tapes of opposing teams every day (even during the offseason) to develop his uncanny ability to read defenses and score against them in one 60-minute game a week.</p>
    <p>Tiger Woods&rsquo; job, in his prime, was winning golf tournaments for a living (among other things). Before the injuries and personal drama, he won 14 major golf tournaments and 79&nbsp;PGA tour events, which more than any active golfer. He practiced religiously every day for 15 years before winning his first pro event at the tender age of 18.</p>
    <p>The obvious commonality between these champions is that not only do they&nbsp;<strong>work their butts off</strong>, but they also&nbsp;<strong>love with they do</strong>.</p>
    <p>They love the challenge and the competition.</p>
    <p>Their&nbsp;<strong>passion for the game</strong>&nbsp;is so strong that it gets them through the hours upon countless hours of tedious tasks that others may not enjoy like tape watching, suicide drills, weight training, putting drills, etc.</p>
    <p>To them, these things are fun!</p>
    <p>Again, we&rsquo;re not gonna sugar coat things. You&rsquo;re all big boys and big girls.</p>
    <p><strong>There will be days when trading SUCKS!</strong></p>
