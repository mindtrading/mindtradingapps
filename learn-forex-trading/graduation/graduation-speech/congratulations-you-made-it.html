    <p><strong>Yay! You made it!</strong></p>
    <p>Congratulations! You&rsquo;ve read all six gazillion pages of the School of Pipsology and now you have everything you need to conquer the forex world, retire in a year or two, and then go travel the world in your Gulfstream G700&trade; jet, right?</p>
    <p>Think again&nbsp;<strong>NOOB</strong>!</p>

    <p><em>I&rsquo;m still a noob!</em></p>
    <p>Sorry to burst your bubble, but you have just barely scratched the surface.</p>
    <p>We&rsquo;re not going to sugarcoat things. We told you early on that it was going to be difficult.</p>
    <p>If you&rsquo;re a noob and just finished the School, you&rsquo;re most likely going to be&nbsp;<strong>horrendously bad at trading.</strong></p>
    <p>But that&rsquo;s okay. Unlike noodles, there&rsquo;s no such thing as an instant expert currency trader. Anything that&rsquo;s worth learning well takes time. That&rsquo;s why instant noodles taste disgusting.</p>
    <p>Going straight into the markets and trading a live account would be like trying out for the NBA just right after reading &ldquo;Basketball for Dummies.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>You&rsquo;d probably get out-smarted, out-hustled, out-muscled, and out-maneuvered. You just haven&rsquo;t developed the skills or mental/physical conditioning enough to hang with the pros yet.</p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s the same thing with the financial markets.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/graduation-shark.png" /></p>
    <p>The trading world is dynamic and complex. It&rsquo;s ruled by brainiacs with PhDs and MBAs from Ivy League Schools, who have huge amounts of capital, and all the technological toys money can buy.</p>
    <p>When you enter the forex trading world, you have to&nbsp;be ready to dive in and wrestle with the biggest sharks.<strong>&nbsp;And they love feasting on noobs</strong>.</p>
    <p>Are you scared now?</p>
    <p>Good!</p>
    <p>We want to make sure you understand that even though you&rsquo;ve got to have fun in everything you do, forex trading is serious business and you have to approach it that way.</p>
    <p>With all that said, anyone with the passion and commitment to learning this business has the chance to get their small piece of a very, very big&nbsp;pie and then some.</p>
    <p>Yes, you can make it, but before beginning your forex trading adventure, here are a few lessons we&rsquo;ve learned that we&rsquo;d like to share to help you get started on the right path.</p>
