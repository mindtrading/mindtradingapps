    <p><strong>Forex signal</strong>&nbsp;services do everything a robot does except the actual execution of trade entries.</p>
    <p>Besides possibly using an automated program, a &ldquo;professional&rdquo; trader may generate trading signals (for a fee, of course) for clients to act upon.</p>
    <p><img  src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/senior-signal.png" />However, you may be paying for a signal in which you do not know the rationale behind each signal and how the &ldquo;professional&rdquo; came up with it.</p>
    <p>You have no idea what the basis for the trade is, just that the &ldquo;professional&rdquo; is telling you that it&rsquo;s a good time to buy or sell.</p>
    <p>In the end,&nbsp;<strong>you are relying on the analysis of a third-party source that is NOT your own</strong>.</p>
    <p>In a typical forex signal service, the programmer creates a set of technical indicators and rules and the program runs to those specifications.</p>
    <p>If price action satisfies the conditions of the signal service, then some kind of notification or alert via email or text message will be sent to the user to react.</p>
    <p>It is ultimately up to the user to decide whether or not to take the signal and trade it.</p>
    <p>While this may sound more beneficial as you have a choice on whether or not to take a trade, the signal service is still programmed to a constant set of rules.</p>
    <p>As we mentioned earlier, the forex market is in a constant state of change.</p>
    <p>While the forex signal service might have been profitable in the past, there is no guarantee that it will be profitable in the future.</p>
    <p>One other thing to think about is if the forex signal service is so profitable, why would the creator want to share the profit?</p>
    <p>Like forex robots, the scam isn&rsquo;t the service itself, but the way it&rsquo;s marketed.</p>
    <p>You may see ads from scammers that promise you&rsquo;ll make a bajillion dollars with their signals.</p>
    <p>Many traders will look at the ad and think, &ldquo;A bajillion dollars!? I could do anything I want with a bajillion dollars!&rdquo;</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2010/07/forex-signals-bajillion-dollars.jpg"  /></p>
    <p>Now stop. Think about it. Massage your lip or chin. Think.</p>
    <p>If that were true, why even run a forex signals business in the first place? Instead, they should be focusing on trading with their signals and making a bajillion dollars for themselves.</p>
