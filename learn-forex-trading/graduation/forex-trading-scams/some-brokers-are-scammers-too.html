    <p>Watch out for forex broker scams!</p>
    <p>Believe it or not, there are some brokers who &ldquo;cheat&rdquo; their clients.</p>
    <p>One way they do so is by&nbsp;<strong>manipulating bid/ask spreads</strong>.</p>
    <p>Normal spreads between brokers would be around 2-3 pips but scammers would have spreads around 7-8 pips.</p>
    <p>Seven pips might not seem like a lot, but it does add up.</p>
    <p>Imagine each time a client trades, he has to pay a spread of 7 pips. Imagine if he takes just a few trades per day.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/graduation-broker-stealing-piggy-bank.png"  />Multiply that by hundreds or even thousands of other clueless clients, you&rsquo;d be rakin&rsquo; in the dough!</p>
    <p>Another way is by&nbsp;<strong>stop hunting</strong>.</p>
    <p>Remember, forex brokers know where clients place their stops.</p>
    <p>Sometimes, they&rsquo;ll make a run for those stops, causing their clients&rsquo; positions to close out.</p>
    <p>Fortunately, many, but not all, broker shenanigans are considered old school.</p>
    <p>Thanks to new rules from regulatory agencies such as the Commodities Futures Trading Commission and the National Futures Association, these old scams have been cracked down upon.</p>
    <p>You should choose a forex broker that is registered with a regulatory agency.</p>
    <p>In the U.S., look for brokers registered as a Futures Commission Merchant (FCM) with the CFTC and an NFA member. Be wary of those brokers that are not regulated by the CFTC and the NFA.</p>
    <p>You should know that the CFTC and NFA were made to protect the public against fraud, manipulation, and abusive trade practices.</p>
    <p>Be careful, it&rsquo;s often difficult to distinguish between regulated and unregulated forex brokers!</p>
    <p>You can verify the CFTC registration and NFA membership status of a particular broker and check their disciplinary history by phoning NFA at (800) 621-3570 or by checking the broker/firm information section (BASIC) at the NFA&rsquo;s website!</p>
    <p>If you&rsquo;re trading forex outside the US, you&rsquo;re in luck! Other countries have regulatory agencies as well and protect individuals as well. More will be mentioned about them later.</p>
    <p>If the broker in question is not registered or regulated by any national agency, then&nbsp;<strong>DO NOT</strong>&nbsp;deposit your money with them. We warned ya, so don&rsquo;t complain to us if you don&rsquo;t get your money back!</p>
    <p>Stay away from non-regulated firms!</p>
    <p>Also, don&rsquo;t be shy to also ask around in our forex forums.&nbsp;It doesn&rsquo;t hurt to get personal opinions.</p>
