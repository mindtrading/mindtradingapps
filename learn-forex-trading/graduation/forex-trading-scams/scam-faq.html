    <p>So what have we learned?</p>
    <p><strong>Scams ARE real!</strong></p>
    <p>Yes! Really bad people are out there trying to make a dishonest living. However, unlucky for them, you are smart!</p>
    <p>You know that the only way to succeed in currency trading is to learn from square one and gain trading experience!</p>
    <p>Now say this three times out loud:</p>
    <p>&ldquo;I will not fall for no-risk robots! I will not succumb to guaranteed returns! Lastly, I will not be lazy and let someone else trade me lucky charms *cough* I mean my money for me!&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Now that we have that over with, let&rsquo;s close out with some questions our viewers have asked us countless times!</p>

    <h2>Q: How can I protect myself from fraud?</h2>
    <p><strong>A:</strong>&nbsp;Easy. Be educated. Be smart. Know what a scam looks like. Anything that seems too good to be true usually really isn&rsquo;t true.</p>
    <h2>Q: How do I choose a forex broker?</h2>
    <p><strong>A:</strong>&nbsp;First and foremost, make sure the broker is regulated by a national agency. DYOR. Research, research, and do more research!</p>
    <h2>Q: Can forex managed accounts be trusted?</h2>
    <p><strong>A:</strong>&nbsp;If your forex manager is yourself, yes! If not, I&rsquo;d exercise extreme caution. But if you&rsquo;re persistent and want to find out the hard way, do a background check and make sure the person has proper licenses and certifications.</p>
    <p>You&nbsp;should find out if the person&rsquo;s forex activities are regulated and by whom. If the person is not regulated, you may be exposed to&nbsp;additional risks.</p>
    <h2>Q: Are forex robots profitable?</h2>
    <p><strong>A:</strong>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s possible, but because they&rsquo;re usually built for a specific set of conditions, their profitability, and how long it may be profitable depends on the market.</p>
    <p>Like human traders, they can go on long profitable runs, have a long string of losing trades in a row, or see-saw somewhere in-between.</p>
    <p>If you take anything away from the school about them, just don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re a &ldquo;set-and-forget&rdquo; solution to trading; they must be monitored closely as well.</p>
    <h2>Q: Where can I capture me a leprechaun?</h2>
    <p>A: Look for a unicorn. Where you&rsquo;ll find a unicorn, you&rsquo;ll find a leprechaun!</p>

    <p>So remember, forex scams DO exist.</p>
    <p>Be wary of them and hold onto your hard-earned money.</p>
    <p>The good news is that there ARE legitimate forex companies out there.</p>
    <p>Make sure you do thorough research on a company if you are thinking about giving them a shot.</p>
    <p>Ask other forex traders on the forums if they&rsquo;ve had experiences with them.</p>
    <p>There is a wealth of information on the Internet so do your homework, use your head, and you&rsquo;ll be just fine.</p>
