    <p>Don&rsquo;t have time to learn how to trade forex? Want to be part of the Billionaire&rsquo;s Club?</p>
    <p>If you answered &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to these two questions, the forex managed accounts&nbsp;scam is the fraud for you!</p>
    <p>You can call our hotline at 1-800-4XFRAUDS!</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/senior-forex-manager.png"  /></p>
    <p>This scam operates by having an investor &ldquo;invest&rdquo; with a &ldquo;professional&rdquo; trader, who trades the investor&rsquo;s capital for a percentage of the profits.</p>
    <p>This can sound appealing, especially to beginners who have no idea what they are doing or don&rsquo;t have the time to learn.</p>
    <p>They figure, &ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s a &lsquo;professional&rsquo; &ndash; he must know what he&rsquo;s doing! It&rsquo;s 100 times better than if I traded by myself!&rdquo;</p>
    <p>The problem with this is that the user is placing complete trust of his/her money into the hands of a complete stranger.</p>
    <p>In a way, it&rsquo;s like taking candy from a baby.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2010/07/taking-candy-from-baby.png" /></p>
    <p>In many cases of managed accounts, the manager actually appropriates funds towards unrelated luxury items such as cars, islands, and castles.</p>
    <p>When finally caught, the manager is not able to pay back the whole amount of stolen capital resulting in unhappy clients and multi-million dollar lawsuits.</p>
    <p>Yes, we know it seems extreme but, more often than not, it happens and people can lose their entire investment.</p>
    <p>Not ALL managed accounts&nbsp;are bad though. Some do have many years of trading experience and are well-qualified in trading real money, but that&rsquo;s more the exception than the norm.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2010/07/forex-scammer.png" />Some trading platforms even offer an option to let traders act as managers using the account structure of the broker.</p>
    <p>This prevents an individual from taking funds to spend on Los Angeles Lakers tickets, trips to the Bahamas, or an Aston Martin Valkyrie.</p>
    <p>While this is a safer option compared to letting an independent manager trade your money, you still lose out on the priceless knowledge and experience gained through studying forex trading.</p>
    <p>If there is one thing we want to stress to traders, it is&nbsp;<strong>EDUCATION</strong></p>
    <p>There is simply no replacement for experience gained through personal studying and trading.</p>
    <p>In the end, the only surefire way to be profitable in the forex market is to be&nbsp;<strong>knowledgeable, practice, and stay disciplined</strong>.</p>
    <p>We&rsquo;ll leave you with just one question.</p>
    <p>Would you trust your hard-earned money with a complete stranger?</p>
    <p>If you&rsquo;re still itching to try out managed forex accounts, make sure you do your homework and find a CREDIBLE manager.</p>
