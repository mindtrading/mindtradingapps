    <p>Dishonest people are constantly trying to swindle people like every single day.</p>
    <p>With the relatively new availability of the forex market, people aren&rsquo;t as familiar with currencies are as they are with stocks and bonds.</p>
    <p>This makes it easier for conniving companies and scheming individuals to mislead people into thinking that making money trading forex is as easy as clicking a button with their &ldquo;End of the Rainbow&rdquo; system.</p>
    <p>There is good news and bad news.</p>
    <p>Bad news first.</p>
    <p><strong>Scams DO exist.</strong></p>
    <p>They are real and they sucker people who think they can&rsquo;t be misled. If caught in a scam, you can and may lose all the money that you &ldquo;invested.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>However, there is very good news!</p>
    <p>In the following&nbsp;lesson, we will teach you about the different types of scams out there, how to prepare yourself, and what you can do in case you encounter a scam.</p>
    <p>We will also describe the regulatory agencies that have jurisdiction in scam cases.</p>
    <p>Remember, not all forex companies are bad.</p>
