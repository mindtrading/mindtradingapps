    <p>Do you want to learn how to make all the money you just deposited in your trading account quickly vanish?</p>
    <p><strong>In 10 days or less?</strong></p>
    <p>Here&rsquo;s a step-by-step guide:</p>
    <h2>Step 1: Buy a super expensive computer.</h2>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2018/12/14144513/trading-computer1-360x360.jpg" /></p>
    <p>Don&rsquo;t forget to buy at least six 27&rdquo; UltraHD 8K monitors and mount them all on a magnificent monitor stand so that you can watch your price charts along with CNBC, Bloomberg TV, Fox Business News, Reuters TV, and Cheddar, all at the same time!</p>
    <p>You need ALL of this stuff in order to trade successfully! Don&rsquo;t forget about the luxury ergonomic chair from&nbsp;Herman Miller that perfectly aligns&nbsp;with your spine&rsquo;s natural curve.</p>
    <p>Once you&rsquo;ve bought them all, watch your account balance in your trading account explode with profits! That gigantic electricity bill due to all your gadgets will look like spare change.</p>
    <h2>Step 2: Focus on trying to find the perfect technical indicator.</h2>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2018/12/14144438/magic-indicator-360x360.jpg" /></p>
    <p>Once you find this mystical technical indicator, it will be like installing an ATM machine in your kitchen.</p>
    <p>Trade BIG.</p>
    <p>No, scratch that. Trade YUGE.</p>
    <p>Your six UltraHD 8K computer monitors will all glow bright&nbsp;<strong>green</strong>&nbsp;due to all the positive pips!</p>
    <h2>Step 3: When your technical indicator says that the currency pair is oversold, buy it right then and there!</h2>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2018/12/14144948/buy-trade-now-360x360.jpg" /></p>
    <p>Always do what your chart indicator says to do.</p>
    <p>Never ever question it. Like&nbsp;ever.</p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s always right. Like always.</p>
    <p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter if important news is coming out or if price action is telling you something different.</p>
    <p>Your puny brain is no match for the indicator.</p>
    <h2>Step 4: Don&rsquo;t pay attention to the current or future economic outlook of the world&rsquo;s biggest countries.</h2>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2018/12/14150958/ignore-economic-data-360x360.jpg" /></p>
    <p>Who cares about the global economy and geopolitics. Economy schmonomy. Zzzzzzz. That stuff is boorriiiiiinggg!</p>
    <p>All you have to do is stare at your charts all day long until a winning trade magically appears.</p>
    <p>Trading is really just a staring contest between you and the market. Whoever blinks first loses. So make sure you concentrate and stare long and hard at your charts.</p>
    <p>Who cares if your eyes start bleeding. Ignore that. Push through it. It&rsquo;s just eye blood.</p>
    <p>Eventually, profits will appear. It&rsquo;s really that easy.</p>
    <h2>Step 5: Make sure to visit a bunch of forex trading forums and go through all the threads until you find hot trading tips.</h2>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2018/12/14152933/trader-typing-360x360.jpg" /></p>
    <p>If you don&rsquo;t find any hot trading tips, then private message total strangers for forex trading tips and ask them for some.</p>
    <p>The less you know about them, the better. It&rsquo;s more mysterious that way. And makes trading fun!</p>
    <p>These tips are free gifts and will make you fabulously wealthy in no time!</p>
    <p>If you&rsquo;re reeeeally&nbsp;lucky, you may even find people posting about their magical technical indicators or EAs with 137% win rates that you can download for free!</p>
    <h2>Step 6: Read what other traders doing and be sure to follow them without question.</h2>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2018/12/14152749/trader-staring-at-computer-352x360.jpg" /></p>
    <p>Following other traders is a no-brainer. You literally need no brain to do it. So your puny brain needs not worry.</p>
    <p>Just blindly copy their trades.</p>
    <p>According to their profiles, these folks have been trading a lot longer than you, which means they definitely must know what they&rsquo;re doing. Right?</p>
    <p>Why am I even asking you a question? That requires thinking.</p>
    <p>Just go ahead and start copying random trades already. The sooner you start, the faster you&rsquo;ll be able to achieve that perfect Instagram lifestyle.</p>
    <h2>Step 7: Skip creating a trading plan. If you see a good trade, just do it.</h2>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2018/12/14153609/trader-taking-the-trade-just-do-it-360x242.jpg" /></p>
    <p>You shouldn&rsquo;t argue with Nike&hellip;even if their slogan is meant for athletes, not traders. Just do it. Victory is yours.</p>
    <p>Forget about developing a trading plan. Don&rsquo;t worry about how or when you&rsquo;re going to exit.</p>
    <p>Never mind the details. The trade is guaranteed to win. It&rsquo;ll be a slam dunk.</p>
    <h2>Step 8: Dream about how much you&rsquo;ll much you&rsquo;ll make, not about how much you&rsquo;ll lose.</h2>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2018/12/14155544/trader-dreaming-big-360x360.jpg" /></p>
    <p>Don&rsquo;t worry about proper position sizing.</p>
    <p>Who cares how much you can lose on a trade. And how much you&rsquo;d need to make back just to return back to breakeven.</p>
    <p>Just think about how much you can win! Then find directions to the nearest Ferrari dealership or Herm&egrave;s store.</p>
    <h2>Step 9: Don&rsquo;t set stop losses. That&rsquo;s for losers.</h2>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2018/12/14160452/winner-360x360.jpg" /></p>
    <p>You are a winner. You win at everything. All you do is win. Just like DJ Khaled. &ldquo;We the best trades!&rdquo;, you proclaim.</p>
    <p>Stop losses are for losers.</p>
    <p>Even if your trade is currently in the red and losing, you know it&rsquo;ll eventually turn around. Unlike everybody else, all of your trades always end up as winners.</p>
    <p>Don&rsquo;t worry about your trade blinking red on your screen. Just like how age is just a number, red is just a color.</p>
    <h2>Step 10: Make trades based on your emotions.</h2>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2018/12/14161137/emotional-trader-360x126.jpg" /></p>
    <p>No need for logic, simply rely on your consistently dependable emotions.</p>
    <p>When you&rsquo;re excited and feel greedy, you buy. When you&rsquo;re scared, you panic and sell.</p>
    <p>Trading emotionally is how you will pile up winning trade after winning trade. At least, that&rsquo;s how you feel.</p>
    <h2>Final Tips</h2>
    <p>Make sure to perform as many of the steps as possible.</p>
    <p>Pretty soon, you&rsquo;ll be seeing that big fat zero under your account balance that you&rsquo;ve always dreamed about.</p>
    <p>If you&rsquo;re lucky, you may even see a negative balance.</p>
    <p>If you&rsquo;re really impatient and want to lose money even&nbsp;<em>faster</em>, feel free to repeat any of the individual steps vigorously.</p>
    <p><strong>But if you want to AVOID blowing your trading account in 10 days or less, now you know what NOT to do.</strong></p>
    <p>A lot of traders have made these mistakes when they first start trading.</p>
    <p><strong>Including myself.</strong></p>
    <p>Hopefully, you don&rsquo;t follow in my footsteps.</p>
