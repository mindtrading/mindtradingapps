    <p>What separates good traders from bad traders?</p>
    <p>A good trader realizes that trading is&nbsp;<strong>patience</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>discipline</strong>, and requires a&nbsp;<strong>trading approach</strong>&nbsp;adapted to their specific<strong>&nbsp;psychological profile</strong>.</p>
    <p>A good trader concentrates on the&nbsp;<strong>PROCESS</strong>&nbsp;of trading, and not just on the result.</p>
    <p>Here&rsquo;s a list of other things that good traders do:</p>
    <h2>What Good Traders Do</h2>
    <p>A good trader knows if they have&nbsp;<strong>sufficient risk capital</strong>&nbsp;in order to achieve their financial objectives.</p>
    <p>A good trader always acts according to their own judgment<strong>.</strong>&nbsp;They&nbsp;<strong>think for themselves</strong>&nbsp;rather than be blindly influenced by others.</p>
    <p>A good trader&nbsp;<strong>never trades on hope.</strong>&nbsp;They analyze the market and take calculated risks.</p>
    <p>A good trader stays out of the market&nbsp;<strong>when in doubt</strong>.</p>
    <p>A good trader<strong>&nbsp;does not chase the market</strong>. They wait for signals to appear based on their market analysis and trading strategy.</p>
    <p>A good trader&nbsp;<strong>does not overtrade</strong>.</p>
    <p>A good trader&nbsp;<strong>does not fight against the trend</strong>. While they may trade pullbacks&nbsp;or countertrend swings, they are aware that this price movement is temporary.</p>
    <p>A good trader always knows the&nbsp;<strong>reward-to-risk ratio</strong>&nbsp;of every trade.</p>
    <p>A good trader&nbsp;<strong>cuts their losses</strong>&nbsp;instead of hoping that the trade will turn around.</p>
    <p>A good trader allows their&nbsp;<strong>profits to run</strong>&nbsp;until an exit signal based on their trading strategy is triggered.</p>
    <p>A good trader always&nbsp;<strong>analyzes their closed trades</strong>&nbsp;to find any lessons on how they can improve.</p>
    <p>A good trader is&nbsp;<strong>patient</strong>&nbsp;and knows that there are periods when they don&rsquo;t need to trade.</p>
    <p>A good trader never widens a stop loss.</p>
    <p>A good trader&nbsp;<strong>never cancels a stop loss</strong>.</p>
    <p>A good trader treats each trade separately.</p>
    <p>A good trader exits the market when in doubt.</p>
    <p>A good trader does not blindly follow the advice of others.</p>
