    <p>In the previous lesson, we talked about why forex brokers are attracted to B-Book execution more than A-Book execution, even though it&rsquo;s riskier because the broker can blow up if it&nbsp;<del>doesn&rsquo;t know WTH it&rsquo;s doing</del>&nbsp;has poor risk management.</p>
    <p>But what if brokers could get the best of both worlds?</p>
    <p>So far, we&rsquo;ve learned that when a broker executes your order, it can choose to&nbsp;<strong>fill the order</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><em>Before</em>&nbsp;hedging (A-Book)</li>
    <li>By&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;hedging at all (B-Book)</li>
    <li>By&nbsp;<em>internalizing</em>&nbsp;first and then choosing one of the above</li>
    <li>By hedging&nbsp;<em>first</em>&nbsp;(STP)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>But a&nbsp;forex broker is not limited to just one form of hedging.</p>
    <p>It can choose any of the above depending on the order and/or customer.</p>
    <p>How a broker determines who to choose for which model depends on different factors like trade size and a customer&rsquo;s profitability profile.</p>
    <p>A broker can generate independent price streams and hedging models for social traders, news traders, API traders, or screen traders.</p>
    <p>Most brokers operate at least an A and B-Book, selecting which trades are internalized vs. hedged with an LP.</p>
    <p>This is known as the &ldquo;<strong>hybrid model</strong>&ldquo;.</p>
    <p><img title="Forex Broker Hybrid Model" src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/05/31173411/forex-hybrid-model-284x360.png" sizes="(max-width: 284px) 100vw, 284px" srcset="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/05/31173411/forex-hybrid-model-284x360.png 284w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/05/31173411/forex-hybrid-model.png 512w" alt="Forex Broker Hybrid Model" width="284" height="360" /></p>
    <p>While your forex broker is always the counterparty to your trades, a hybrid approach is where the broker may decide to execute your trades internally OR offset your trades externally to a liquidity provider.</p>
    <p>A &ldquo;hybrid&rdquo; approach allows a broker to:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Offset orders with other customers</li>
    <li>Hedge orders with an external counterparty (liquidity providers)</li>
    <li>Or not hedge and accept full market risk</li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
    <p><strong>Market risk</strong>&nbsp;is the risk of a loss in a position caused by adverse price movements. Learn more about the perils of market risk here.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Here are two examples of how a broker operates when taking the hybrid approach:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>The broker can&nbsp;<strong>divide its customers&nbsp;</strong>and hedge the trades of some of the customers to an LP (A-Book or STP) and keep the rest &ldquo;in-house&rdquo; (B-Book).</li>
    <li>The broker can decide to hedge all trades of a&nbsp;<strong>certain size or larger</strong>&nbsp;to a liquidity provider and keep&nbsp;the rest &ldquo;in-house&rdquo; (B-Book).</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Customer Profiling</h2>
    <p>In the hybrid model,&nbsp;the forex broker has to decide&nbsp;<strong>which customers go to A-book and which go to B-book</strong>. And why?</p>
    <p>Once these rules and criteria are set, the&nbsp;broker will have an &ldquo;<strong>order routing system</strong>&rdquo; or &ldquo;<strong>order execution engine</strong>&rdquo; whose purpose is&nbsp;to manage orders by sending them to A-Book or B-Book automatically.</p>
    <p>The broker will most likely&nbsp;<strong>hold the trades of losing traders</strong>&nbsp;for themselves and<strong>&nbsp;hedge against the trades of profitable traders</strong>.</p>
    <p>This means that successful traders will be A-Booked, while the small unprofitable traders will be B-Booked, where the market risk is kept &ldquo;in house&rdquo;</p>
    <p>To successfully identify profitable and unprofitable traders, forex brokers have software that analyzes how customers trade.</p>
    <p><img title="Customer Profiling by Forex Broker" src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/05/31173501/customer-profile-360x360.png" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" srcset="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/05/31173501/customer-profile-360x360.png 360w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/05/31173501/customer-profile-150x150.png 150w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/05/31173501/customer-profile.png 512w" alt="Customer Profiling by Forex Broker" width="360" height="360" /></p>
    <p>They can profile traders by the amount of their deposit, the notional value of each trade, the leverage used, the risk taken with each trade, the use or non-use of protective stops, etc.</p>
    <p>For example, there seems to be a common pattern of behavior among losing traders.&nbsp;These behaviors include:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Depositing a tiny amount of cash which means a tiny starting account balance (usually less than $1,000).</li>
    <li>Risking 10% or more of their tiny account balance per trade.</li>
    <li>Not using stop losses.</li>
    <li>Adding to losing trades.</li>
    <li>Using high leverage on their tiny accounts makes them frequently susceptible to margin calls and stop outs.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>With the use of computer algorithms, brokers are able to analyze trading patterns to profile the trades of each customer.</p>
    <p><strong>Brokers can be different &ldquo;brokers&rdquo; to different customers.</strong></p>
    <p>It can be a B-Book broker to some and an A-Book broker to others.</p>
    <p>The reasons behind customer profiling are simple.</p>
    <p><img title="Forex Broker Profiles Trader" src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/05/31174150/profile-trader-296x360.png" sizes="(max-width: 296px) 100vw, 296px" srcset="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/05/31174150/profile-trader-296x360.png 296w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/05/31174150/profile-trader.png 550w" alt="Forex Broker Profiles Trader" width="296" height="360" /></p>
    <p>The customers who are A-Booked are more successful and will generally be trading in larger lot sizes, so fully offsetting these orders with an external counterparty eliminates exposure to market risk while still earning a (small) fee from the spread.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, the customers who are B-Booked&nbsp;will generally be small orders, mostly losing trades, and the broker can warehouse the market risk since the risk is small because the trade size is small.</p>
    <p>This allows the broker to profit from losing trades from its B-Book customers, and also earn from the price markup from its A-Book customers.</p>
    <h2>Large Forex Brokers</h2>
    <p>For larger forex brokers, because they have a large number of customers opening trades in both (long and short) directions, they are able to internally offset (&ldquo;internalize&rdquo;) a great deal of their order flow, which allows them to minimize their market risk WITHOUT having to hedge with an external counterparty.</p>
    <p>When not all of the positions are able to be hedged, the<strong>&nbsp;excess market risk</strong>&nbsp;exposure is then hedged externally.</p>
    <p>A large customer base allows most large forex brokers to theoretically offset most of their customers&rsquo; trades with each other.</p>
    <p>This allows revenue to be earned from customers&rsquo; transaction fees (from the spread), which means that<strong>&nbsp;it is the volume of customer trading that drives revenue, not from customers&rsquo; losses</strong>.</p>
    <p>For smaller brokers, if they are unable to hedge their trade with another one of their customers, they &ldquo;B-Book&rdquo; (take the other side of) the trade,&nbsp;<strong>up to their market risk limit</strong>. Anything above this limit would be hedged externally.</p>
    <p>The use of B-Book combined with only externally hedging beyond a certain risk limit provides&nbsp;<strong>better order execution</strong>&nbsp;(because it allows the broker to immediately execute your trade) while keeping<strong>&nbsp;latency and its costs to a minimum</strong>&nbsp;(because it doesn&rsquo;t have to A-Book or STP every trade which would mean paying the LP&rsquo;s spread every time).</p>
    <h2>Most Forex Brokers Use a Hybrid Approach</h2>
    <p>We don&rsquo;t see anything wrong with a broker operating both A-Book and B-Book. The reality is that most brokers do use a hybrid approach.</p>
    <p>The profits gained from traders placed in the B-Book allow brokers who use a hybrid approach to provide all their customers with&nbsp;<strong>very competitive spreads</strong>.</p>
    <p>The main disadvantage of this approach is that if the broker&nbsp;<strong>manages the risk of B-Book poorly.</strong>&nbsp;The broker could end up blowing up and going out of business.</p>
    <p>Trades from new retail traders will most likely be B-Booked. This makes sense since most new traders lose. It&rsquo;s easy money for the broker.</p>
    <p><img title="Trader Profitability Profile" src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/05/31175847/trader-profitability-360x298.png" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" srcset="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/05/31175847/trader-profitability-360x298.png 360w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/05/31175847/trader-profitability.png 484w" alt="Trader Profitability Profile" width="360" height="298" /></p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s very rare for a retail forex broker to be 100% A-Book. It&rsquo;s a tough business model.</p>
    <p>The A-Book model is a much lower-margin business than B-Book and requires brokers to focus on&nbsp;<strong>customers who trade frequently in large quantities</strong>&nbsp;while trying to keep costs as low as possible.</p>
    <p>With so many unprofitable traders, a B-Book model&nbsp;provides an additional source of revenue.</p>
    <p>There is nothing wrong with a retail broker having a hybrid of both A-Book and B-Book.&nbsp;<strong>What is wrong is when a forex broker starts to manipulate trades in its favor.&nbsp;</strong></p>
    <p>The most important consideration for a retail broker, at least in a well-regulated jurisdiction, should be ensuring<strong>&nbsp;fair pricing and the&nbsp;best order execution for their customers</strong>, regardless of whether it adopts an A or B book model.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Regardless of the broker&rsquo;s execution model, what&rsquo;s most important is that retail traders<strong>&nbsp;receive transparent prices that track the &ldquo;real&rdquo;(institutional )FX market in real-time</strong>&nbsp;AND be able to&nbsp;<strong>get their orders filled at these prices</strong>&nbsp;(or better) without any delays.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>We will discuss pricing and order execution quality in more detail in later lessons, but first, let&rsquo;s learn one more &ldquo;risk management&rdquo; approach that forex brokers use.</p>
