    <p>Aside from forex brokers who &ldquo;A-Book&rdquo; or &ldquo;B-Book&ldquo;, you might also come across the term &ldquo;C-Book&rdquo;.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;<strong>C-Book</strong>&rdquo; is a term that&rsquo;s used to describe &ldquo;risk management strategies&rdquo; that forex brokers and CFD providers use that are supposedly different from A-Book or B-Book.</p>
    <p>In our opinion, &ldquo;C-Book&rdquo; is just marketing jargon. It&rsquo;s not really a different approach that brokers use to manage risk, it&rsquo;s more of a vague term to describe variations or tweaks of A-Book and B-Book execution.</p>
    <p><img title="C-Book Forex Broker" src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/06/08194145/c-book-forex-broker-360x352.png" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" srcset="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/06/08194145/c-book-forex-broker-360x352.png 360w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/06/08194145/c-book-forex-broker.png 512w" alt="C-Book Forex Broker" width="360" height="352" /></p>
    <p>As you&rsquo;ll see, &ldquo;C-Book execution&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t really used by the broker to manage risk, but to try and make more money for itself.</p>
    <p>These execution methods are also considered controversial and it&rsquo;s questionable whether forex brokers should be doing them. We&rsquo;ll leave it up to you to be the judge.</p>
    <p>We will cover three forms of &ldquo;C-Booking&rdquo;:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Partial hedging</li>
    <li>&ldquo;Overhedging&rdquo;</li>
    <li>&ldquo;Reverse hedging&rdquo;</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Partial Hedge</h2>
    <p>The most common form of &ldquo;C-Book execution&rdquo; is the&nbsp;<strong>partial hedging of a customer&rsquo;s order</strong>.</p>
    <p>A broker can hedge market risk in part and not in its entirety. This will reduce, but not eliminate, adverse price movements to the position being hedged.</p>
    <p>The risk that remains unhedged, also known as&nbsp;<strong>residual risk</strong>, gives the broker the&nbsp;<strong>opportunity to profit</strong>&nbsp;IF the price moves in its favor.</p>
    <p>Think of this risk management strategy as a &ldquo;<strong>partial A-Book</strong>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<strong>partial B-Book</strong>&rdquo;.</p>
    <p>Basically, the broker has A-Booked a c<strong>ertain percentage of its risk</strong>&nbsp;and has B-Booked the rest.</p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s look at an example where a broker<strong>&nbsp;hedges 50% of a customer&rsquo;s position</strong>.</p>
    <p><img title="C-Book Example" src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/04/26140732/c-book-example-1-a-720x780.png" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" srcset="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/04/26140732/c-book-example-1-a-720x780.png 720w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/04/26140732/c-book-example-1-a-768x832.png 768w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/04/26140732/c-book-example-1-a-332x360.png 332w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/04/26140732/c-book-example-1-a.png 943w" alt="C-Book Example" width="720" height="780" /></p>
    <p>Elsa opens a long EUR/USD position at<strong>&nbsp;1.2001</strong>.</p>
    <p>Her position size is 1,000,000 units or 10 standard lots. This means a 1-pip move equals $100.</p>
    <p>The broker hedges&nbsp;<strong>50% of the risk</strong>&nbsp;by opening a long 500,000 EUR/USD position with an LP at<strong>&nbsp;1.2000</strong>.</p>
    <p>(If it had gone long the entire 1,000,000 units, this would be considered A-Book, since 100% of the position is hedged.)</p>
    <p>EUR/USD rises in price.</p>
    <p>Elsa wants to take profit and exits her trade at 1.2101, resulting in a gain of 100 pips or $10,000 ($100 x 100 pips).</p>
    <p>For the broker, this means a $10,000 loss.</p>
    <p>If the broker had just B-Booked Elsa&rsquo;s trade, it would&rsquo;ve had to eat the&nbsp;<strong>entire loss</strong>.</p>
    <p>But fortunately, it hedged part of Elsa&rsquo;s trade.</p>
    <p>While the hedge trade resulted in a gain of&nbsp;<strong>102 pips</strong>, since the position size was 500,000 (half of the 1,000,000), the profit was $5,100.</p>
    <p>This profit made from the LP helped reduce some of the losses from Elsa&rsquo;s trade, so the<strong>&nbsp;net loss was $4,900</strong>&nbsp;(instead of the full $10,000).</p>
    <p>Conversely, if the EUR/USD fell, the profits of the broker against Elsa would be reduced by the losses incurred from hedging.</p>
    <p><img title="C-Book Example: EURUSD Falls" src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/04/26140945/c-book-example-1-b.png" sizes="(max-width: 943px) 100vw, 943px" srcset="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/04/26140945/c-book-example-1-b.png 943w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/04/26140945/c-book-example-1-b-768x832.png 768w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/04/26140945/c-book-example-1-b-332x360.png 332w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/04/26140945/c-book-example-1-b-720x780.png 720w" alt="C-Book Example: EURUSD Falls" width="943" height="1021" /></p>
    <p>In this example, Elsa opens a long EUR/USD position at&nbsp;<strong>1.2001</strong>.</p>
    <p>The broker hedges 50% of the risk by opening a long 500,000 EUR/USD position with an LP at 1.2000.</p>
    <p>EUR/USD falls in price.</p>
    <p>Elsa&rsquo;s stop-loss is hit and her trade is exited at<strong>&nbsp;1.1951</strong>, resulting in a loss of 50 pips or $5,000.</p>
    <p>For the broker, this means a&nbsp;<strong>$5,000 gain</strong>.</p>
    <p>If the broker had just B-Booked Elsa&rsquo;s trade, it would&rsquo;ve kept<strong>&nbsp;all this profit</strong>.</p>
    <p>But it didn&rsquo;t, it hedged part of Elsa&rsquo;s trade.</p>
    <p>The hedge trade resulted in a loss of 48 pips. Since the position size was 500,000 (half of the 1,000,000), the&nbsp;<strong>loss was $2,400</strong>.</p>
    <p>This loss suffered from the LP helped reduce some of the profit from Elsa&rsquo;s trade, so the&nbsp;<strong>net profit was $2,600</strong>&nbsp;(instead of the full $5,000).</p>
    <p>So far, you&rsquo;ve seen how a broker can fully hedge (=100%) against a customer&rsquo;s position, known as&nbsp;<strong>A-Book</strong>. And you&rsquo;ve seen how a broker can partially hedge (&gt;100%) against a customer&rsquo;s position, known as<strong>&nbsp;C-Book</strong>.</p>
    <h2>&ldquo;Overhedge&rdquo;</h2>
    <p><strong>C-Booking is not limited to partial hedging</strong>.</p>
    <p>Another variant of C-Booking is when a broker can also choose to &ldquo;<strong>overhedge&rdquo;</strong>, meaning it can hedge<strong>&nbsp;more than 100% of a customer&rsquo;s position</strong>.</p>
    <p>For example, instead of a hedge trade that covers 100%, it can choose to hedge&nbsp;<strong>110%</strong>.</p>
    <p>Rather than &ldquo;C-Book&rdquo;, a more accurate name would probably be &ldquo;<strong>A-Book+</strong>&ldquo;.</p>
    <p>Why would a broker want to do this?</p>
    <p>If the broker thinks the customer&rsquo;s trade will make a profit, it can &ldquo;ride along&rdquo; with the customer and make some extra profits.</p>
    <p><img title="C-Book Example: Overhedge" src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/04/26141324/c-book-example-1-c-overhedge-720x780.png" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" srcset="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/04/26141324/c-book-example-1-c-overhedge-720x780.png 720w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/04/26141324/c-book-example-1-c-overhedge-768x832.png 768w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/04/26141324/c-book-example-1-c-overhedge-332x360.png 332w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/04/26141324/c-book-example-1-c-overhedge.png 943w" alt="C-Book Example: Overhedge" width="720" height="780" /></p>
    <p>Elsa opens a long 1,000,000 EUR/USD position at 1.2001, which means the broker is now short 1,000,000 EUR/USD.</p>
    <p>Here, the broker can decide to:</p>
    <ol>
    <li><strong>Not hedge</strong>&nbsp;(B-Book)</li>
    <li><strong>Partially hedge</strong>&nbsp;(C-Book)</li>
    <li><strong>100% hedge</strong>&nbsp;(A-Book)</li>
    <li><strong>&gt;100% hedge</strong>&nbsp;(C-Book)</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The broker has profiled Elsa as an informed trader and chooses<strong>&nbsp;option #4</strong>.</p>
    <p>It hedges<strong>&nbsp;110% of the risk</strong>.</p>
    <p>It goes long 1,100,000 EUR/USD with an LP at&nbsp;<strong>1.2000</strong>.</p>
    <p>If it A-Booked the trade, it would&rsquo;ve gone long 1,000,000.</p>
    <p>Instead, it went long 1,00,000 plus an additional 100,000 units or the equivalent of&nbsp;<strong>110% Elsa&rsquo;s position size</strong>.</p>
    <p>Elsa turns out right and EUR/USD rises.</p>
    <p>She exits her trade for a gain of 100 pips or $10,000.</p>
    <p>Obviously, this means the broker has a loss of $10,000.</p>
    <p>But&hellip;.<strong>notice its P&amp;L with the LP</strong>.</p>
    <p>Since the broker &ldquo;<strong>overhedged</strong>&rdquo; and had a bigger position size against the LP, its profit from the LP exceeded its loss from Elsa.</p>
    <p>The broker was able to &ldquo;juice&rdquo; its profits.</p>
    <p>This &ldquo;overhedging&rdquo; strategy is not without risks though.</p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s see what happens when the customer loses.</p>
    <p><img title="C-Book Example: Overhedge But Customer Loses" src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/04/26141528/c-book-example-1-c-overhedge-customer-loses.png" sizes="(max-width: 943px) 100vw, 943px" srcset="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/04/26141528/c-book-example-1-c-overhedge-customer-loses.png 943w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/04/26141528/c-book-example-1-c-overhedge-customer-loses-768x832.png 768w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/04/26141528/c-book-example-1-c-overhedge-customer-loses-332x360.png 332w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/04/26141528/c-book-example-1-c-overhedge-customer-loses-720x780.png 720w" alt="C-Book Example: Overhedge But Customer Loses" width="943" height="1021" /></p>
    <p>In this scenario, EUR/USD falls and Elsa exits her trade at a loss of $10,000.</p>
    <p>Obviously, this means the broker has a gain of $10,000.</p>
    <p>But&hellip;.notice its P&amp;L with the LP.</p>
    <p>Since the broker &ldquo;<strong>overhedged</strong>&rdquo; and had a bigger position size against the LP, its loss from the LP exceeded its profit from Elsa.</p>
    <p>This is the tradeoff if the broker&rsquo;s hedge exceeds 100%.</p>
    <p>It&nbsp;<strong>exposes itself to greater loss</strong>&nbsp;if the customer ends up wrong.</p>
    <h2>&ldquo;Reverse Hedge&rdquo;</h2>
    <p>Another variant of C-Booking is when a broker &ldquo;reverse hedges&rdquo; a customer&rsquo;s trade either partially or completely.</p>
    <p>This practice is based on the assumption that a customer trades so poorly,&nbsp;<strong>it&rsquo;s possible to make money by not only B-Booking the position but to ADD on to the B-Booked position</strong>!</p>
    <p>Rather than another variant of &ldquo;C-Book&rdquo;, a more accurate name would probably be &ldquo;<strong>B-Book+</strong>&ldquo;.</p>
    <p>Basically, the broker does not even try to hedge or transfer market risk, it purposely takes on MORE market risk!</p>
    <p>When a broker chooses to &ldquo;reverse hedge&rdquo; a customer&rsquo;s trade completely, it is basically&nbsp;<strong>increasing its B-Book risk</strong>.</p>
    <p><img title="C-Book Example: Reverse Hedge" src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/04/26141838/c-book-example-1-e-reverse-hedge-720x780.png" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" srcset="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/04/26141838/c-book-example-1-e-reverse-hedge-720x780.png 720w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/04/26141838/c-book-example-1-e-reverse-hedge-768x832.png 768w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/04/26141838/c-book-example-1-e-reverse-hedge-332x360.png 332w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/04/26141838/c-book-example-1-e-reverse-hedge.png 943w" alt="C-Book Example: Reverse Hedge" width="720" height="780" /></p>
    <p>Elsa goes long 1,000,000 EUR/USD at<strong>&nbsp;1.2001</strong>.</p>
    <p>Since the broker is Elsa&rsquo;s counterparty, it is now short 1,000,000 EUR/USD.</p>
    <p>The broker is now exposed to market risk (if EUR/USD rises).</p>
    <p>If we stop here, this would be B-Book execution.</p>
    <p>Does the broker wish to A-Book the trade and completely hedge?</p>
    <p>Nope.</p>
    <p>It has profiled Elsa as an&nbsp;<strong>unprofitable trader</strong>&nbsp;so instead of completely or even partially hedging with an LP, it decides to &ldquo;<strong>reverse hedge</strong>&rdquo;&nbsp;<strong>50% of the trade</strong>.</p>
    <p>So instead of going long EUR/USD, which is what it would&rsquo;ve done to cover its market exposure, it&nbsp;<strong>goes short 500,000 units with an LP</strong>!</p>
    <p>Remember, it is already short 1,000,000 units against its customer. But it&nbsp;<strong>ADDED even more risk exposure</strong>&nbsp;with the additional 500,000 units against the LP.</p>
    <p>In this scenario, the broker turned out correct.</p>
    <p>EUR/USD did fall.</p>
    <p>Elsa exited her trade with a loss, which translates to a gain for the broker.</p>
    <p>But its trade with the LP also resulted in a&nbsp;<strong>gain</strong>.</p>
    <p>As long as the broker chooses correctly which trade to &ldquo;revere hedge&rdquo;, this strategy can be&nbsp;<strong>very lucrative</strong>.</p>
    <p>But if it chooses wrong, the risk it exposes itself to is even greater than if it had B-Booked the trades and would result in much bigger losses.</p>
    <p>Here&rsquo;s an example where it doesn&rsquo;t go well for the broker.</p>
    <p><img title="C-Book Example: Broker Reverse Hedges and Loses" src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/04/26142048/c-book-example-1-f-reverse-hedge-broker-is-wrong-720x780.png" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" srcset="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/04/26142048/c-book-example-1-f-reverse-hedge-broker-is-wrong-720x780.png 720w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/04/26142048/c-book-example-1-f-reverse-hedge-broker-is-wrong-768x832.png 768w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/04/26142048/c-book-example-1-f-reverse-hedge-broker-is-wrong-332x360.png 332w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/04/26142048/c-book-example-1-f-reverse-hedge-broker-is-wrong.png 943w" alt="C-Book Example: Broker Reverse Hedges and Loses" width="720" height="780" /></p>
    <p>Elsa goes long 1,000,000 EUR/USD at<strong>&nbsp;1.2001</strong>.</p>
    <p>Since the broker is Elsa&rsquo;s counterparty, it is now short 1,000,000 EUR/USD.</p>
    <p>Instead of going long EUR/USD, which is what it would&rsquo;ve done to cover its market exposure, it goes short 500,000 units with an LP.</p>
    <p>Remember, it is already short 1,000,000 units against its customer. But it&nbsp;<strong>ADDED more risk exposure</strong>&nbsp;with the additional 500,000 units against the LP.</p>
    <p>EUR/USD rises.</p>
    <p>Elsa exited her trade with a gain, which translates to a loss for the broker.</p>
    <p>If the broker had A-Booked and opened a hedge trade with an LP, it would&rsquo;ve had a gain from the LP to offset its loss with Elsa.</p>
    <p>Instead, its trade with the LP also&nbsp;<strong>resulted in a loss</strong>.</p>
