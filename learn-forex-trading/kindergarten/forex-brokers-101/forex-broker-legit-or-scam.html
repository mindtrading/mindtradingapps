    <p>Who are you trading with?</p>
    <p>Is the forex broker a legitimate company? Can you trust it?</p>
    <p>Unlike Batman in the story from the previous lesson,&nbsp;<strong>you&rsquo;re not going to know who you are trading with</strong>. And even if you did, that doesn&rsquo;t mean you should blindly trust them.</p>
    
    
    <div class="chat-container">

    <div class="blockquote blockquote-spider">
      <p>Do not trust Spider-Man. He stole my money. Feel free to skip his upcoming movie.</p>

    </div>
    
    <p>Even though it started as fun and games where Batman and Spider-Man were supposed to be making friendly bets on trying to guess where GBP/USD was headed, it didn&rsquo;t end up so friendly. Batman ended up getting duped by a fellow superhero, who was supposedly a &ldquo;good guy&rdquo;.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>If you&rsquo;re not familiar with the story above, this means you haven&rsquo;t read our earlier lesson on How Forex Brokers (Kinda) Workstarring Batman and Spider-Man.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s highly recommended that you read this lesson first.</p>

    <h2>Forex Brokers</h2>
    <p>In order to trade forex, you will need a trading account with a&nbsp;<strong>provider of online foreign exchange (FX) trading or CFD trading services</strong>, more commonly known as retail &ldquo;<strong>forex brokers&rdquo; or &ldquo;CFD providers&rdquo;.&nbsp;</strong></p>
    <p>When you open a trading account with this company, you will need to deposit&nbsp;<strong>money</strong>&nbsp;to the account so you can trade.</p>
    <p><strong>Are you sure you can trust this broker?</strong></p>
    <p><img  src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/05/30130200/shady-forex-broker-360x360.png" /></p>
    <p>Unfortunately, not all brokers are honest and trustworthy.</p>
    <p>A big issue with the retail forex trading industry is a&nbsp;<strong>lack of transparency</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>unclear regulatory structures with insufficient oversight</strong>.</p>
    <p>Due to its decentralized and global nature, the forex market is less regulated than other financial markets making it&nbsp;<strong>more prone to fraud</strong>.</p>
    <p>And with the rise of internet-based trading platforms since the early 2000s, forex trading has become even more accessible and popular among retail traders across the world.</p>
    <p>This explosion of&nbsp;<strong>noob traders</strong>&nbsp;(&ldquo;fresh meat&rdquo;) creates more opportunities for dubious behavior by shady brokers like fraudulent schemes, order manipulation, refusal to pay out for wins, or preventing account holders from withdrawing their funds.</p>
    <p>In the past, many forex brokers were unregulated, which means that these brokers were NOT operating under the supervision of a governing body whose role is supposed to protect traders from being fleeced.&nbsp;So if you are scammed, there&rsquo;s<strong>&nbsp;no hope for any legal recourse</strong>.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/05/31125621/money-is-gone-360x360.png" /></p>
    <p>Your money is gone.</p>
    <p>Fast forward to today and while the retail forex industry has slowly become more regulated, shady brokers still exist who should not be in business.</p>
    <p>This is why the most important first step is verifying the&nbsp;<strong>legitimacy of the forex broker</strong>&nbsp;you choose.</p>
    <p>When you&rsquo;re looking to trade forex, it&rsquo;s important to identify brokers who are reputable and avoid the ones that are not.</p>
    <p><strong>You don&rsquo;t want to end up being part of the unfortunate group of individual traders who fall prey to a forex scam.</strong></p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/05/28154753/scam-victim-club-360x360.png" /></p>
    <p>In order to identify reputable brokers from shady ones, y<strong>ou need to do your homework</strong>&nbsp;before depositing a large amount of money with a broker.</p>
    <p>The forex broker you choose is going to be your first critical decision as a new trader.</p>
    <p>Why?</p>
    <p>Because you&rsquo;re going to be handing over money to this company!</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/05/31133225/deposit-money-to-forex-broker-150x150.png" /></p>
    <p>So the first thing you need to make absolutely sure, especially BEFORE you make your first trade, is once you transfer funds to the broker&hellip;if you&rsquo;ll also be able to<strong>&nbsp;withdraw those funds</strong>.</p>
    <p>You might make the assumption that once your money is in your trading account that you&rsquo;ll be able to trade with it and then withdraw it whenever you want to cash out your profits.</p>
    <p>But don&rsquo;t just assume this is true!&nbsp;<strong>VERIFY</strong>!</p>
    <p>Never assume, always check.</p>
    <p>You can be the most awesome trader in the world, but if your broker disappears with your money, then it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
    <p><img title="Most Awesome Broke Trader" src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/05/29002918/most-awesome-broke-trader.png"  /></p>
    <p>You&rsquo;d just end up being the most awesome&nbsp;<em>broke</em>&nbsp;trader in the world.&nbsp;ðŸ¤£</p>
    <p>If you want to stay awesome, but avoid being broke, then here are some important questions to consider before choosing a broker.</p>
    <h2>Is it a real company?</h2>
    <p>Is the forex broker a real company?</p>
    <p>Don&rsquo;t be fooled by a nicely designed website.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/05/29153632/incorporation-150x150.png" /></p>
    <p>Make sure there&rsquo;s an actual<strong>&nbsp;legally incorporated company</strong>&nbsp;behind that website.</p>
    <p>Here are things to look for to verify that they are a real company:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>What is its formal business name?</li>
    <li>Where is it incorporated and registered to do business?</li>
    <li>How long has it been in business?</li>
    <li>Can you find anything on Google about the company?</li>
    <li>Have there been any recent press releases or articles about the company?</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Where is it located?</h2>
    <p>Does the company have a&nbsp;<strong>physical office address</strong>?</p>
    <p>Don&rsquo;t be fooled by a listed address on their website.&nbsp;Make sure there&rsquo;s a real office behind that address.</p>
    <p>A simple way to check if the office is an actual office is to use Google Maps.</p>
    <p>Enter the address in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/maps" target="_blank" rel="noopener noopener">Google Maps</a>&nbsp;and see what appears.</p>
    <p><img title="Google Map Forex Broker's Office Address" src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/05/29115129/google-map-forex-broker-360x270.png" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" /></p>
    <p>And to get a better view of the office, you can also use&nbsp;<a href="https://earth.google.com/web/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noopener">Google Earth</a>.</p>
    <p>Enter the address in Google Earth and see what appears.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/05/29115431/google-earth-forex-broker-360x270.png"  /></p>
    <p>Zoom in until you can see the building they&rsquo;re in. Is it an actual office building? Or does it look suspicious?</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/05/29175044/forex-broker-office-building-360x270.png" /></p>
    <p>If it looks like the building above, are you sure you really want to hand over your money with this broker?&nbsp;ðŸ¤”</p>
    <p>If no building is present and instead, you&rsquo;re seeing a warehouse on a tiny tropical island or even worse, an empty plot of land, you probably want to pass on this company.</p>
    <h2>Who runs the company?</h2>
    <p>Do you know who runs the company? Or is it a &ldquo;ghost corporation&rdquo; with no active employees?</p>
    <p>Who are the principals of the company?</p>
    <p>A&nbsp;<strong>principal</strong>&nbsp;is generally someone who holds a significant ownership stake in a company or has a formal title and&nbsp;ability to control the company&rsquo;s activities.</p>
    <p>For example, principals could be the founder (or co-founders), President, CEO, COO, CFO, other C-level officers, or any person or entity that owns 10% or more of the company.</p>
    <p>Beware of&nbsp;&ldquo;ownership-opaque&rdquo; companies, where their true owners and/or company officers aren&rsquo;t disclosed.</p>
    <p>This lack of transparency might be due to the fact that it&rsquo;s actually a criminal enterprise whose members wish to remain anonymous.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/05/29125730/anonymous-forex-broker-owners.png" /></p>
    <p>If you&rsquo;re trusting a company with your funds, you should know the people who are in control of the company.</p>
    <p>If something goes wrong, you&rsquo;ll know who to hold accountable.</p>
    <h2>Can you contact the company?</h2>
    <p>Does the company provide multiple ways to contact them?</p>
    <p>You want to make sure your broker is there when you need to ask a question or have a problem.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Does it have a&nbsp;<strong>phone number</strong>?</li>
    <li>Does it have an&nbsp;<strong>email address</strong>?</li>
    <li>Does it have a&nbsp;<strong>live online chat</strong>?</li>
    <li>What are its&nbsp;<strong>customer support hours</strong>?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It&rsquo;s not enough to see all three listed on their website. Just because it&nbsp;<em>looks&nbsp;</em>like there are multiple ways for you to get in touch with the broker doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s true. <strong>Verify that they all actually work and it&rsquo;s not just for show</strong>.</p>
    <p><strong>ðŸ“ž&nbsp;Call the phone number.</strong>&nbsp;Does somebody pick up quickly?</p>
    <p><strong>ðŸ“§&nbsp;Send an email.</strong>&nbsp;How long does it take to receive a reply? (Automated replies don&rsquo;t count.)</p>
    <p><strong>ðŸ’¬&nbsp;Start an online chat.</strong>&nbsp;Does it work? Or are you simply asked to send a message by filling out a form?</p>
    <p>ðŸ¤–&nbsp;If the online chat does work, are you talking to a chatbot or an actual human?</p>
    <p>âŒš&nbsp;What are their customer support hours? Is their support staff available&nbsp;<strong>24 hours a day, 5 days a week</strong>?</p>
    <p>You can also test how good their customer support is by&nbsp;<strong>opening a demo account</strong>. Once you&rsquo;re logged in to their demo trading platform, send them a question using their support feature.</p>
    <p>Since you&rsquo;re a potential new customer who may open a live account, they should be responsive. If not, it should make you wonder how their support will be once you&rsquo;re already a customer.</p>
    <p><img title="Forex Broker Customer Service" src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/05/29124746/forex-broker-customer-service.png"  /></p>
    <p>A reputable broker should have a&nbsp;<em>dedicated</em>&nbsp;support team that can answer your questions. In a live trading situation, phone access or live online chat is a must since an email reply may take days.</p>
    <p>At the end of the day, you want to make sure that the broker will be there for YOU when you need them.</p>
    <h2>Is your money safe?</h2>
    <p>Do not rush into opening a live account or &ldquo;real money&rdquo; account without knowing how your funds are handled.</p>
    <p>You need to ask the following questions:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>What bank do you use to store customer funds?</li>
    <li>Are customer funds held separately from the company&rsquo;s bank account?</li>
    </ul>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/06/04171027/bank-150x150.png"  /></p>
    <p>The forex broker should be using a reputable bank. Ask who they use. Would you trust your funds with an unknown bank?</p>
    <p>Before you deposit any funds with a forex broker, make sure it uses segregated accounts.</p>
    <p>A segregated account is a dedicated bank account where all its customers&rsquo; money is kept&nbsp;<strong>completely separate from the company funds</strong>.</p>
    <p>This means that&nbsp;<strong>your money is kept entirely separate from the broker&rsquo;s money</strong>.</p>
    <p>The main reason for segregated accounts is to prevent the broker from using YOUR funds outside of your trading account.</p>
    <p>If a forex broker does not segregate accounts, it will be able to use customers&rsquo; funds for operational expenses. And maybe an exotic sports car (or two) for the CEO? ðŸ¤”</p>
    <p><img title="Segregated Funds" src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/06/04172552/segregated-funds.png" /></p>
    <p>Or it might just use all deposited funds to buy a boatload of bitcoin and disappear.</p>
    <p>In the past, shady brokers have used their customers&rsquo; money for their own purposes, putting this money at unnecessary risk.</p>
    <p>You do not want your broker to use your money for the wrong purposes. A segregated account protects your money against dishonest and fraudulent behavior from brokers.</p>
    <p>Should a broker become bankrupt, it also ensures that customer funds are easily identified.&nbsp;In the event that the forex broker&rsquo;s become insolvent, your money would not be affected.</p>
    <p>Depending on the country, regulations state that segregated accounts can&rsquo;t be used to pay creditors, and customer funds must be returned to the customers.</p>
    <p>Imagine a broker&rsquo;s money and its customers&rsquo; money all mixed together. If this was the case, companies to who your broker owes money could come after your money!</p>
    <p>Having segregated accounts ensures that customer funds will be easily identified and returned in case of bankruptcy.</p>
    <p><strong>Segregated accounts between customer funds and a broker&rsquo;s funds provide safety.&nbsp;</strong>If a broker does not use segregated funds, do not deposit your money with them.</p>
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>In order to trade forex, you need to use the services of a retail forex broker. And since you&rsquo;ll be depositing your hard-earned money, you need to DYOR and make sure the company is legit.</p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s review the questions that you should consider:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Is it a real company?</li>
    <li>Where is it located?</li>
    <li>Who runs the company?</li>
    <li>Can you contact the company?</li>
    <li>Is your money handled safely?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>There is one last question that you should consider that&rsquo;s crucial.</p>
    <p><strong>Is the forex broker licensed and regulated?&nbsp;</strong></p>
