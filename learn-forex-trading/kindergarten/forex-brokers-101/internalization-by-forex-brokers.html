    <p>With A-Book (or STP) execution, the broker manages the risk of each trade&nbsp;<strong>individually</strong>.</p>
    <p>But what if one trader opens a long GBP/USD position, and another trader opens a short GBP/USD position&nbsp;<strong>at or around the same time</strong>?</p>
    <p>Rather than the A-Book broker having to hedge each trade separately with an LP, why can&rsquo;t the risk exposure from the two trades &ldquo;cancel&rdquo; each other out?</p>
    <p>Well, they can.</p>
    <p><img title="Forex Broker Aggregate Orders" src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/06/06175125/aggregate-orders-360x340.png" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" srcset="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/06/06175125/aggregate-orders-360x340.png 360w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/06/06175125/aggregate-orders.png 530w" alt="Forex Broker Aggregate Orders" width="360" height="340" /></p>
    <p><strong>Instead of managing risk for every individual trade, a broker can aggregate customer trades that all contain the same currency pair.</strong></p>
    <p>This process of&nbsp;<em>aggregating</em>&nbsp;trades is known as I<strong>nternalization</strong>.</p>
    <p>For example, some customers may buy GBP/USD, while others may sell GBP/USD. Different traders have different opinions so there may be instances where opposing trades can be &ldquo;matched&rdquo; or &ldquo;offset&rdquo; with each other.</p>
    <p>When a broker&nbsp;<strong>matches one customer&rsquo;s trade with another customer&rsquo;s</strong>, it&nbsp;<strong>removes the market risk in a similar manner to hedging the trade with an external liquidity provider</strong>&nbsp;(LP).</p>
    <p>Because the broker does not send the trades to an LP, it&nbsp;<strong>saves money</strong>&nbsp;by NOT having to transact with an LP and pay the LP&rsquo;s spread.</p>
    <p>A broker can aggregate all long and short GBP/USD positions and&nbsp;<strong>offset them against each other</strong>.</p>
    <p>This is why forex brokers want a large customer base. It makes it easier for them to &ldquo;internalize&rdquo; risk.&nbsp;<strong>The larger their customer base, the more trades that occur, which means the higher the likelihood that trades can be offset with each other.</strong></p>
    <p>Since it costs money to trade with liquidity providers (due to the spread), this helps the broker save money.</p>
    <p>For example, the broker can see in its book that it has a total of&nbsp;<strong>10 million&nbsp;</strong>units of long GBP/USD and&nbsp;<strong>8 million&nbsp;</strong>units of short GBP/USD positions.</p>
    <pre>10M long - 8M short = net 2M long</pre>
    <p>The difference would leave the broker with a&nbsp;<strong>net long 2 million&nbsp;</strong>GBP/USD position.</p>
    <p>This &ldquo;difference&rdquo; is also known as the &ldquo;<strong>residual</strong>&rdquo; since it&rsquo;s what remains after all trades are offset.</p>
    <p>What remains exposes the broker to market risk which is why it&rsquo;s also called &ldquo;<strong>residual risk</strong>&rdquo;.</p>
    <p>The broker now has to decide how to manage this residual risk.</p>
    <p>It has two choices:</p>
    <ol>
    <li><strong>Accept</strong>&nbsp;the risk (&ldquo;Do nothing&rdquo;)</li>
    <li><strong>Transfer</strong>&nbsp;the risk (&ldquo;Hedge&rdquo;)</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Example: A-Book Execution vs. Internalization (Full Offset)</h2>
    <p>Elsa buys and Ariel sells the same amount of the same currency pair (GBP/USD) at the same time.</p>
    <p>Under this scenario, the broker prefers to transfer its market risk to its LP.</p>
    <p>The LP&rsquo;s prices are marked up by&nbsp;<strong>0.0011</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>1 pip</strong>:</p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s see the difference between A-Book execution and Internalization.</p>
    <h3>A-Book</h3>
    <p><img title=" A-Book Execution vs. Internalization (Full Offset)" src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/06/19160612/a-book-vs-internalization-full-offset.png" sizes="(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px" srcset="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/06/19160612/a-book-vs-internalization-full-offset.png 940w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/06/19160612/a-book-vs-internalization-full-offset-768x679.png 768w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/06/19160612/a-book-vs-internalization-full-offset-360x318.png 360w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/06/19160612/a-book-vs-internalization-full-offset-780x690.png 780w" alt=" A-Book Execution vs. Internalization (Full Offset)" width="940" height="831" /></p>
    <h3>Internalization</h3>
    <p><img title="Internalization" src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/04/26123057/internalization.png" sizes="(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px" srcset="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/04/26123057/internalization.png 940w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/04/26123057/internalization-768x679.png 768w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/04/26123057/internalization-360x318.png 360w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/04/26123057/internalization-780x690.png 780w" alt="Internalization" width="940" height="831" /></p>
    <p>If the broker exercised A-Book execution, it &ldquo;paid the spread of LP&rdquo; and the broker&rsquo;s P&amp;L vs. LP would equal:</p>
    <pre>(1.2007 &minus; 1.2010) x 1,000,000 = -300 USD</pre>
    <p>If the broker took advantage of the fact that the trades happened at the same time and didn&rsquo;t hedge with an LP, then it wouldn&rsquo;t have paid that cost.</p>
    <p>The primary risk for a broker operating the Internalization model occurs when positions are not completely offset, leaving the broker with&nbsp;<strong>exposure to price movements which could result in a loss</strong>.</p>
    <p>If a broker has customer orders that can offset each other partially, then the broker is left with a much&nbsp;<strong>smaller net position</strong>&nbsp;that leaves the broker exposed to market risk.</p>
    <p>Again, this is known as &ldquo;<strong>residual risk</strong>&rdquo;.</p>
    <p>It can manage this residual risk in two ways:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>The broker can transfer this risk externally to a liquidity provider by executing a hedge trade.</li>
    <li>The broker can accept this risk and manage it internally.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Example: A-Book Execution vs. Internalization + Hedge Order</h2>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s see the difference between A-Book execution and Internalization followed by a hedge trade:</p>
    <h3>A-Book</h3>
    <p><img title=" A-Book Execution vs. Internalization (Full Offset)" src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/04/26122936/a-book-vs-internalization-full-offset-780x690.png" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" srcset="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/04/26122936/a-book-vs-internalization-full-offset-780x690.png 780w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/04/26122936/a-book-vs-internalization-full-offset-768x679.png 768w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/04/26122936/a-book-vs-internalization-full-offset-360x318.png 360w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/04/26122936/a-book-vs-internalization-full-offset.png 940w" alt=" A-Book Execution vs. Internalization (Full Offset)" width="780" height="690" /></p>
    <h3>Internalization + Hedge Order</h3>
    <p><img title="Internalization + Hedge Order" src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/04/26123600/internalization-and-hedge-order-780x690.png" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" srcset="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/04/26123600/internalization-and-hedge-order-780x690.png 780w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/04/26123600/internalization-and-hedge-order-768x679.png 768w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/04/26123600/internalization-and-hedge-order-360x318.png 360w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/04/26123600/internalization-and-hedge-order.png 940w" alt="Internalization + Hedge Order" width="780" height="690" /></p>
    <p>If the broker exercised A-Book execution then the broker&rsquo;s realized P&amp;L vs. LP would equal:</p>
    <pre>(1.2008 &minus; 1.2009) x 1,000,000 = -100 USD</pre>
    <p>But the broker didn&rsquo;t necessarily need to A-book Elsa&rsquo;s trade because Eric&rsquo;s trade could&rsquo;ve offset.</p>
    <p>So if the broker had &ldquo;internalized&rdquo; or aggregated all GBP/USD positions, it wouldn&rsquo;t need to hedge Elsa&rsquo;s trade and would&rsquo;ve saved money by not paying the LP&rsquo;s spread.</p>
    <p>Even after internalization, this still leaves the broker with a<strong>&nbsp;net short position of 2,000,000 GBP/USD</strong>.</p>
    <p>As you can see, the broker&nbsp;<strong>hedged this residual risk with an LP</strong>.</p>
    <p>If there are enough trades of similar size to offset one another,&nbsp;<strong>internalization can be very profitable for a broker</strong>.</p>
    <p>That said, if positions remain that can&rsquo;t be offset,<strong>&nbsp;this residual risk exposes the broker to the same market risk as a B-Book trade</strong>.</p>
    <p>A common practice when brokers internalize trades is to:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>First,&nbsp;<strong>offset customer positions against each other</strong>, and then&hellip;</li>
    <li>Aggregate the remaining risk exposure and hedge externally with an LP based on a &ldquo;<strong>volume-weighted average price</strong>&rdquo; or &ldquo;<strong>VWAP</strong>&rdquo;.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><img title="VWAP Hedge" src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/04/26124756/offset-vwap.png" sizes="(max-width: 1206px) 100vw, 1206px" srcset="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/04/26124756/offset-vwap.png 1206w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/04/26124756/offset-vwap-768x885.png 768w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/04/26124756/offset-vwap-1200x1383.png 1200w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/04/26124756/offset-vwap-312x360.png 312w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/04/26124756/offset-vwap-677x780.png 677w" alt="VWAP Hedge" width="1206" height="1390" /></a>From the example above, we can see that Elsa&rsquo;s trade was internally offset by Ariel&rsquo;s trade.</p>
    <p>Elsa went long 100,000 GBP/USD, while Ariel went short 100,000 GBP/USD, so the broker&rsquo;s risk exposure is zero.</p>
    <p>But then three other traders, Eric, Jasmine, and Louis, went long GBP/USD at different prices.</p>
    <p>With no other customers going short, the broker wants to hedge this risk.</p>
    <p>Instead of hedging each trade individually, the broker<strong>&nbsp;aggregates the three separate trades</strong>&nbsp;and creates just a single hedge trade with an LP based on a&nbsp;<strong>VWAP of 1.2511</strong>.</p>
    <p>Here&rsquo;s how VWAP is calculated:</p>
    <div>
    <div>
    <table border="1px">
    <thead>
    <tr>
    <th>TRADER</th>
    <th>VOLUME</th>

    <th>NOTIONAL VALUE</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
    <td>Eric</td>
    <td>200,000</td>
    <td>1.2508</td>
    <td>250,160</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Jasmine</td>
    <td>300,000</td>
    <td>1.2510</td>
    <td>375,300</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Louis</td>
    <td>500,000</td>
    <td>1.2512</td>
    <td>625,600</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>1,000,000</td>
    <td>1,251,060</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>
    </div>
    </div>
    <pre><strong>VWAP</strong> = Total Notional Value / Total Volume
    <strong>VWAP</strong> = 1,251,060 / 1,000,000
    <strong>VWAP</strong> = 1.2511</pre>
    <p>Aggregating multiple customer trades is a common practice for brokers since&nbsp;<strong>trading with most LPs requires a minimum trade size</strong>, usually at least&nbsp;<strong>1 standard lot</strong>&nbsp;or increments of&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;100,000 units</strong>.</p>
    <p>So if a broker&rsquo;s customers are opening positions&nbsp;<strong>smaller than 100,000 units</strong>, then the broker has to wait until other customers trade where it can then &ldquo;<strong>bundle</strong>&rdquo; the risk from the different trades</p>
    <p>Another reason that a broker may aggregate orders is that it&nbsp;<strong>reduces the time it takes to get all hedged with an LP</strong>.</p>
    <p>For example, if the broker is using STP execution, the execution of many small buy orders one at a time could &ldquo;<strong>signal</strong>&rdquo; to an LP that this pattern may continue.</p>
    <p>If it detects more orders interested in buying than selling, it can &ldquo;shade&rdquo; the price and raise the ask (buy) price higher than it normally would.</p>
    <p>This may result in the broker&rsquo;s customers getting worse fills than if the broker just sent&nbsp;<strong>one, single order to the LP</strong>.</p>
    <p>This is particularly important in illiquid or fast-moving markets.</p>
    <p>Here&rsquo;s a summary of how a forex broker benefits depending on its execution method and the outcome of a trade:</p>
