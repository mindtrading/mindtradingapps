    <p>For every forex broker<strong>, each and every trade</strong>&nbsp;entered into by its customers represents<strong>&nbsp;exposure to market risk.</strong></p>
    <p>Market risk is the risk of a loss in a position caused by adverse price movements.</p>
    <p>Because the forex broker is always the counterparty to your trades, it may decide to&nbsp;<strong>execute your trades internally</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>hedge your trades externally</strong>.</p>
    <p>The term &ldquo;<strong>hedging</strong>&rdquo; refers to the process where a forex broker reduces market risk exposure by entering into a<strong>&nbsp;parallel transaction</strong>&nbsp;with another entity (a &ldquo;liquidity provider&rdquo;).</p>
    <p>Rather than hedge every single trade, the most popular hedging policy these days is for a broker to hedge customer exposure on a&nbsp;<strong>net basis</strong>.</p>
    <p>This is where incoming&nbsp;<a href="https://www.babypips.com/learn/forex/internalization-by-forex-brokers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noopener">trades are internalized</a>&nbsp;before any trades are externally hedged.</p>
    <p>This hedging policy gives&nbsp;<strong>aggregate customer exposure</strong>&nbsp;the opportunity to offset itself&nbsp;<em>before</em>&nbsp;being hedged in the underlying institutional FX market.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>When one customer trades in one direction and another trades in an equal and opposite direction&hellip;.the market risk exposure is&nbsp;<strong>offset</strong>.</li>
    <li>However, when customers trade in the same direction,&nbsp;<strong>market risk builds up</strong>&nbsp;for the broker. This risk is then reduced by hedging in the underlying market.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Risk limits, governed and assessed by the broker&rsquo;s&nbsp;<strong>overall risk management policies</strong>, determine the maximum market risk that a forex broker can undertake.</p>
    <p>To make these hedges, the forex broker deposits collateral (margin) with a counterparty. (Similar to how you post margin with the forex broker.)</p>
    <p>This is important to know because posting margin means the broker has to put up cash (&ldquo;margin&rdquo;) with LPs they trade with. If one of these LPs were to fail and not be able to return the broker&rsquo;s margin, the broker may end up in a perilous financial position where it may not be able to fulfill its financial obligations with its customers (like you).</p>
    <p>This is why, when selecting the hedging counterparties (&ldquo;liquidity providers&rdquo;), the broker considers the competitive quotes offered, credit rating, the efficiency of service, reliability of technology, reputation, and financial standing.</p>
    <p>For smaller brokers, they may not be able to choose their LPs as they solely rely on the services of a Prime of Prime (PoP) to hedge their trades and are limited to the LPs that the PoP grants the broker access to.</p>
    <p>Unless stated by your broker, it&rsquo;s important to note that a broker&rsquo;s hedging practice may not&nbsp;<em>totally</em>&nbsp;eliminate risk to its customers.</p>
    <p><strong>Ask your broker for a written copy of its hedging policy.</strong></p>
    <p><img title="Forex Broker's Hedging Policy" src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/06/05164659/hedging-policy.png" sizes="(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px" srcset="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/06/05164659/hedging-policy.png 256w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/06/05164659/hedging-policy-150x150.png 150w" alt="Forex Broker's Hedging Policy" width="256" height="256" /></p>
    <p>The hedging policy outlines the procedures that it adopts to&nbsp;<strong>manage its exposure to market risk</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>discloses&nbsp;the counterparties with which it transacts to hedge that risk</strong>.</p>
    <p>By asking for this, it will provide you insight into its hedging procedures so that you are better informed to assess the&nbsp;<strong>counterparty risk</strong>&nbsp;in dealing with your broker.</p>
    <p>Remember, if your broker goes bust, your money goes down with it.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>We&rsquo;ve discussed the perils of counterparty risk in detail in the previous lesson, Where Are You Trading?</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>If your broker doesn&rsquo;t want to disclose any of these details, it might be a good time to find a broker who will.</p>
    <p><strong>The only way a broker should earn your trust is through transparency</strong>.</p>
    <p>Be suspicious of any broker who isn&rsquo;t transparent with its&nbsp;<strong>hedging policy</strong>&nbsp;which should detail not only its&nbsp;<strong>hedging practices</strong>&nbsp;but&nbsp;<strong>disclose its hedging counterparties</strong>&nbsp;(its &ldquo;liquidity providers&rdquo;).</p>
    <h2><strong>Summary</strong></h2>
    <p>We have explored the basic mechanics of how brokers hedge and manage market risk.</p>
    <p>We introduced a number of risk management concepts like &ldquo;<strong>A-Book</strong>&rdquo;, &ldquo;<strong>B-Book</strong>&rdquo; and&nbsp;<strong>different variants of &ldquo;C-Book&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;that retail FX and CFD trading platforms may use.</p>
    <p>Due to the&nbsp;<strong>high levels of ambiguity at which brokers tend to operate</strong>, we hope we have shed some light on what happens &ldquo;behind the scenes&rdquo; regarding how they manage their risk and make money.</p>
    <p>Now you know that all retail forex brokers take the opposite side of your trade.</p>
    <p>Your broker is the counterparty to ALL of your trades.</p>
    <p>When a broker executes your trade, it can:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Offset your trade&nbsp;<em>internally</em>&nbsp;with another customer&rsquo;s trade (Internalization)</li>
    <li>Offset your trade&nbsp;<em>externally</em>&nbsp;with a liquidity provider
    <ul>
    <li>If this is done&nbsp;<em>before</em>&nbsp;it confirms your trade, it is known as pre-hedging (STP)</li>
    <li>If this is done&nbsp;<em>after</em>&nbsp;it confirms your trade, it is known as post-hedging (A-Book)</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Not offset&nbsp;<em>at all</em>&nbsp;and accept market risk (B-Book)</li>
    <li><em>Partially</em>&nbsp;offset your trade externally with a liquidity provider and B-Book the rest (C-Book)</li>
    <li>Offset&nbsp;<em>more than 100%</em>&nbsp;of the risk of your trade externally with a liquidity provider (C-Book)</li>
    <li>Not offset at all and accept market risk and also &ldquo;<em>reverse hedge</em>&rdquo; externally with a liquidity provider (C-Book)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>While we covered multiple methods used by brokers to manage their risk, it&rsquo;s important to know that every broker is different and each will adopt&nbsp;<strong>their own practices that suit their risk appetite</strong>.</p>
    <p>Hedging is considered expensive and because brokers want to maximize profits, they prefer to hedge as little as possible.</p>
    <p>Risk management practices also continue to evolve and there is no &ldquo;standard&rdquo; policy for how brokers manage their risk.</p>
    <p>Traders may have some reservations about brokers who B-Book and think they should only trade with brokers who A-Book, but what ultimately matters is&nbsp;<strong>accurate pricing</strong>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<strong>quality of execution you receive on your orders.&nbsp;</strong></p>
