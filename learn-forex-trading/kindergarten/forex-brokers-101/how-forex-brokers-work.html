   <p>Using a story, let&rsquo;s learn how forex brokers work&hellip;</p>
<p>Once upon a time, two frenemies, Batman and Spider-Man, were hanging out.</p>
<p>They were lounging on the couch watching a movie, Justice League (Snyder&rsquo;s Cut), but after a couple of hours, their attention span started to drift.</p>
<p>Even Batman began to get annoyed at watching himself as his character onscreen constantly growled in a low, deep voice due to his bitterness of not having innate superpowers like the others.</p>
<p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/06/07184434/forex-traders-looking-at-screen-360x341.png" /></p>
<p>All of a sudden, Spider-Man jumped to his feet and with excitement, and shouts:</p>

  <div class="chat-container">
   <div class="blockquote blockquote-spider">
       <p>Yo Bruce!</p>
   </div>

   <div class="blockquote blockquote-batman">
       <p>Call me Batman!</p>
   </div>

 
   <div class="blockquote blockquote-spider">
      <p>Whatever Bruce. Anyways, I have a fun idea!</p>
      </div>
      <div class="blockquote blockquote-batman">
      <p>Oooh!&nbsp; I like fun! What is it?</p>
      </div>
      <div class="blockquote blockquote-spider">
      <p>Let&rsquo;s play a guessing game on whether the price of something will go up or down.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="blockquote blockquote-batman">
      <p>A guessing game? You spiders are so clever.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="blockquote blockquote-spider">
      <p>Dude I&rsquo;m not a spider. I just acquired spider-related abilities after a bite from a radioactive spider. There&rsquo;s a difference. Just because I wear a spandex suit with a spider symbol doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;m actually a spider.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="blockquote blockquote-batman">
      <p>Sure, whatever. My Batsuit is still better. It accentuates my nipples, and my absolutely chiseled set of abs. Anyways, I&rsquo;m interested. Not only am I wealthy, but I&rsquo;m brilliant. My conjectures always turn out correct. Please elaborate on the details of this game.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="blockquote blockquote-spider">
      <p>The game works like this: Try to guess if the GBP/USD exchange rate will go up or down. Let&rsquo;s say the current exchange rate is 1.4000. Do you think it will go up or down?</p>
      </div>

      <p>Batman doesn’t trust spiders. He unlocks his Batphone and looks up the current GBP/USD 
         exchange rate on Google and confirms that it is 1.4000. He wants to make sure Spider-Man 
         isn’t just pulling numbers out of his spider butt.</p>



      <div class="blockquote blockquote-batman">
        <p>I think it will go up.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="blockquote blockquote-spider">
        <p>Oh really? Let&rsquo;s make a bet then.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="blockquote blockquote-batman">
        <p>What kind of bet? How will it work?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="blockquote blockquote-spider">
        <p>If GBP/USD goes up, I&rsquo;ll pay YOU the difference between its price right now and whatever the price is when you decide to close the bet. But if GBP/USD goes down, you&rsquo;ll pay ME the difference. Payouts will be in cash. Also, you can close the bet whenever you want. What do you say?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="blockquote blockquote-batman">
        <p>Let&rsquo;s do it! I&rsquo;ll take that bet.</p>
        </div>

    <p> Batman is now long 1 unit of GBP/USD at 1.4000. This means that a 1 pip move equals $0.0001.<br>
        One hour later, Spider-Man mentions to Batman that GBP/USD has risen to 1.4100. It has gone up 100 pips.</p> 
       
       
        <div class="blockquote blockquote-spider">
            <p>Yo Dark Knight, the exchange rate has gone up 0.01 or 100 pips.</p>
            </div>

            <p>Batman checks his Batphone and lo and behold, GBP/USD has indeed risen to 1.4100.</p>

            <div class="blockquote blockquote-batman">
                <p> Not sure how long this price will hold up. I’m out. Let’s close the bet.</p>
                </div>
           <p></p>

           <div class="blockquote blockquote-spider">
            <p>Gosh darnit. My &ldquo;spidey-sense&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t seem to work on the forex market. Looks like I lost. Your payout is $0.01. Don&rsquo;t spend it all at once.</p>
            </div>


            <p>Spider-Man tosses Batman a penny.</p>


      <p>Batman gladly accepts the money and after having some greedy thoughts, says:</p>

      <div class="blockquote blockquote-batman">
      <p>All I made was $0.01 profit. That type of tiny profit might be good enough for a spider, but not for a bat. If I had only made a bigger bet, I could&rsquo;ve made a lot more money and become even wealthier.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="blockquote blockquote-spider">
      <p>Okay, Mr. Spoiled Bratman, let&rsquo;s make the same bet. But this time, instead of betting 1 unit worth of GBP/USD, let&rsquo;s bet 10,000 units of GBP/USD!</p>
      </div>
      <div class="blockquote blockquote-batman">
      <p>But I&rsquo;m not carrying &pound;10,000 worth of dollars! My Batsuit is too tight. It&rsquo;s like wearing black skinny jeans that cover my entire sexy body.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="blockquote blockquote-spider">
      <p>Oh. And here I thought you were rich. How much money do you have on you?</p>
      </div>
      <p>Batman checks his Batwallet.</p>
      <div class="blockquote blockquote-batman">
      <p>I have $20. Excluding the penny that I just won from you.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="blockquote blockquote-spider">
      <p>No problem Batsy. How about we just pretend that I&rsquo;ve loaned you the entire amount. This way, for every 1-pip move, you&rsquo;ll gain $1. This means if GBP/USD goes up 100 pips again, instead of making $0.01, you&rsquo;ll make $100!</p>
      </div>
      <div class="blockquote blockquote-spider">
      <p>I don&rsquo;t trust dudes who wear tight black suits with capes so I&rsquo;ll use your $20 as collateral to cover the initial risk if the price falls and moves against you.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="blockquote blockquote-spider">
      <p>Think of it as a security deposit. If you win the bet, you&rsquo;ll get it back.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="blockquote blockquote-spider">
      <p>If GBP/USD starts to fall, rather than pay up, you might decide to jump in your Batmobile and leave. I don&rsquo;t want to end up empty-handed so holding your $20 as collateral will protect me. If you try to leave without paying, your $20 will be forfeited to me.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="blockquote blockquote-spider">
      <p>Also, if the price falls more than 20 pips, you don&rsquo;t have any more cash to cover any losses beyond that, so I&rsquo;ll automatically close the bet and keep your $20.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="blockquote blockquote-spider">
      <p>As long as the price doesn&rsquo;t fall below 20 pips, which is the value of your collateral ($20), the bet remains open until you tell me to close it.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="blockquote blockquote-batman">
      <p>Okay. Sounds good. But what about you? Are you sure you can pay up this time if I win again?</p>
      </div>
      <p>Spider-Man flashes an evil grin.</p>
      <div class="blockquote blockquote-spider">
      <p>Of course. I&rsquo;m an Avenger. You can trust me.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="blockquote blockquote-batman">
      <p>Fine.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="blockquote blockquote-spider">
      <p>Fantastic. Let&rsquo;s begin!</p>
      </div>
      <p>Batman checks his Batphone and verifies that the current GBP/USD exchange rate is 1.41000.</p>
      <div class="blockquote blockquote-batman">
      <p>I&rsquo;m betting that it&rsquo;ll go up from 1.4100, its current price. Here&rsquo;s my $20 to open the bet.</p>
      </div>
      <p>Spider-Man suddenly senses GBP/USD will continue to rise so he tries to stall by pretending not to hear Batman.</p>
      <div class="blockquote blockquote-batman">
      <p>Hello? Did you hear me? Unlike snakes, spiders aren&rsquo;t deaf. Here&rsquo;s my $20 to open the bet.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="blockquote blockquote-spider">
      <p>What was that? So you do want to open a bet? My price for GBP/USD has changed. It&rsquo;s at 1.4150 now. You still want to make the bet?</p>
      </div>
      <div class="blockquote blockquote-batman">
      <p>Dude, what the hell. I thought you said GBP/USD was at 1.4100. Now you change the price all of a sudden?</p>
      </div>
      <div class="blockquote blockquote-spider">
      <p>That&rsquo;s my new price. So are you in? Better hurry, before I change my price again.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="blockquote blockquote-batman">
      <p>Fine. I&rsquo;m in. I bet it&rsquo;ll go up from 1.4150.</p>
      </div>
      <p>Batman is now long 10,000 units of GBP/USD at 1.4150. A 1 pip move equals $1.</p>
      <p>A couple of hours later, Spider-Man announces that GBP/USD is now trading at 1.4350.</p>
      <p>GBP/USD has gone up by 200 pips.</p>
      <div class="blockquote blockquote-batman">
      <p>I&rsquo;d like to close the bet now.</p>
      </div>
      <p>At the start of the bet, GBP/USD was at $1.4150. And at the end of the bet, GBP/USD was at $1.4350. So the difference is $0.02 or 200 pips.</p>
      <p>But since the bet size is 10,000 units, Spider-Man&rsquo;s payout to Batman is<strong>&nbsp;$200</strong>&nbsp;($0.02 x 10,000).</p>
      <div class="blockquote blockquote-spider">
      <p>Fothermucker! Looks like you won the bet again! It&rsquo;s gone up by 200 pips, which means you won $200.</p>
      </div>
      <p>With the imaginary &ldquo;10,000 units&rdquo; that Spider-Man conjured up, Batman has made $200.</p>
      <p>Spider-Man pays him $200 out of his own pocket and also returns the original $20 (that was used as collateral).</p>
      <p>With just $20, Batman won $200. A 10x return!</p>
      <div class="blockquote blockquote-batman">
      <p>Let&rsquo;s play again. I think GBP/USD will continue to&hellip;.</p>
      </div>

      <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/06/03192832/bat-signal.png" /></p>
      <div class="blockquote blockquote-batman">
      <p>Damnit. The Bat-Signal! BRB!</p>
      </div>
      <p>Twenty minutes later&hellip;</p>
      <div class="blockquote blockquote-batman">
      <p>Let&rsquo;s play again. I think GBP/USD will continue to go up. But I want to increase my bet size to 100,000 units.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="blockquote blockquote-spider">
      <p>Oh we got a whale over here! Looks like someone wants to trade bigger. You sure you don&rsquo;t want me to call you Whaleman? Batwhale?</p>
      </div>
      <div class="blockquote blockquote-batman">
      <p>😑</p>
      </div>
      <div class="blockquote blockquote-spider">
      <p>Okay, I can increase my imaginary loan to you.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="blockquote blockquote-spider">
      <p>My price for GBP/USD is 1.4300. But this time, since your bet size is bigger, I&rsquo;ll need $200 from you as collateral.</p>
      </div>
      <p>Batman hands Spider-Man the $200 he just won.</p>
      <p>Batman is now long 100,000 units of GBP/USD at 1.43000. This means that a 1 pip move now equals $10.</p>
      <p>A couple of minutes later, GBP/USD has fallen to 1.4295, a drop of 5 pips.</p>
      <div class="blockquote blockquote-spider">
      <p>GBP/USD is now down 5 pips. That means you have an unrealized loss of $50 (5 pips x $10).</p>
      </div>
      <div class="blockquote blockquote-spider">
      <p>If you want, I can close out the bet now and take $50 from your collateral as payment and return the remaining $150 to you.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="blockquote blockquote-batman">
      <p>Hell no! Don&rsquo;t be a pest! I still believe GBP/USD will go up. The bet stays open!</p>
      </div>
      <div class="blockquote blockquote-spider">
      <p>Okaaay.</p>
      </div>
      <p>Five minutes later, GBP/USD plummets.</p>
      <div class="blockquote blockquote-spider">
      <p>The price of GBP/USD has quickly dropped to 1.4275. You&rsquo;re now down 25 pips. This means you have an unrealized loss of $250. Since your collateral ($200) isn&rsquo;t enough to cover this loss, I&rsquo;ve closed the bet and your collateral is now mine. Thanks for the $200!</p>
      </div>

      <p>In this simple story, there&rsquo;s a lot to unpack.</p>
      <p>For example, notice how:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Spider-Man literally creates a &ldquo;guessing game&rdquo; from his mind where you could make bets on the direction of the price of&nbsp;<em>anything</em>&nbsp;and make money if your prediction is correct?</li>
      <li>Spider-Man can make up any price he wants?</li>
      <li>Spider-Man can move his price at any time even when Batman is about to open his bet?</li>
      <li>Spider-Man can make up any bet size he wants regardless of whether Batman has enough money?</li>
      <li>Spider-Man is always taking the other side of the bet? And nobody else?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This story provides a lot of hints on how trading with a retail forex broker works.</p>
      <p>In case it wasn&rsquo;t obvious,&nbsp;<strong>Batman is you, the trader</strong>. While&nbsp;<strong>Spider-Man is the forex broker</strong>.</p>
      <p>Notice how Spider-Man or Batman didn&rsquo;t actually own any British pounds. No actual quids were ever exchanged. They were simply making dollar-denominated bets on the price fluctuations of GBP/USD.</p>
      <p>With retail forex trading, you don&rsquo;t take ownership of the currencies.</p>
      <p>You&rsquo;re basically making a bet with your forex broker on whether the price of a currency pair will rise or fall.</p>
      <p>The payout is the difference between the price when the bet was made and when the bet was closed.</p>
      <p>Either&nbsp;<strong>you or the broker</strong>&nbsp;will have to pay the difference depending on who ends up wrong.</p>
      <p>The risk here for you is that your forex broker defaults or doesn&rsquo;t have the money to pay for any profits that you&rsquo;ve made.</p>
      <p>Let&rsquo;s return to the story and see how this could happen.</p>
      <p>The next day, Batman and Spider-Man meet up for breakfast.</p>
      <p>After finishing their avocado toast topped with chopped almonds and a drizzle of smoked olive oil, Batman stares deeply into Spider-Man&rsquo;s eyes and says:</p>
      <div class="blockquote blockquote-batman">
      <p>Let&rsquo;s play that guessing game again. I think GBP/USD will go up today. My bet size will be 100,000 units.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="blockquote blockquote-spider">
      <p>Okay. My GBP/USD&rsquo;s price is 1.4300. I&rsquo;ll need $200 from you again as collateral.</p>
      </div>
      <p>Batman hands Spider-Man $200.</p>
      <p>If you didn&rsquo;t notice, Spider-Man magically created a 100,000 unit position size and required just $200 of &ldquo;margin&rdquo;. This is an example of leveraged trading.</p>
      <p>One hour later, Batman asks for the current price of GBP/USD.</p>
      <div class="blockquote blockquote-spider">
      <p>GBP/USD is now trading at 1.4600.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="blockquote blockquote-batman">
      <p>Booyah! GBP/USD has gone up 300 pips! At $10/pip, I&rsquo;ve made $3,000 in profit! I&rsquo;m gonna buy me a new Batboat.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="blockquote blockquote-spider">
      <p>Uh, congrats bro, but we have a problem.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="blockquote blockquote-batman">
      <p>What?</p>
      </div>
      <div class="blockquote blockquote-spider">
      <p>I can&rsquo;t pay up. I don&rsquo;t have the money.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="blockquote blockquote-batman">
      <p>What do you mean you don&rsquo;t have the money?! But you took the bet!</p>
      </div>
      <div class="blockquote blockquote-spider">
      <p>I did. But I didn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d lose. The only money I have is the $200 you gave me as collateral. I can give you back that.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="blockquote blockquote-batman">
      <p>WTF?! What about my $3,000 payout?!</p>
      </div>
      <p>Spider-Man looks up and points to the sky&hellip;.</p>
      <div class="blockquote blockquote-spider">
      <p>Look at that! It&rsquo;s the Bat-Signal!</p>
      </div>
      <p>Batman looks up and sees nothing. When he looks back down, he discovers that Spider-Man is gone!</p>
      <p>In this scenario, the &ldquo;house went bust&rdquo;.</p>
      <p>Spider-Man took the opposite of Batman&rsquo;s bet but didn&rsquo;t have the capital to fulfill his obligation to Batman.</p>
      <p>This is known as &ldquo;<strong>counterparty credit risk</strong>&rdquo; (Can the other party of a transaction pay?).</p>
      <p>When you open a trade with your forex broker, you and the broker become&nbsp;<strong>counterparties</strong>&nbsp;of the trade.</p>
      <p>Just like Spider-Man, the broker takes the opposite side of your bet.</p>
      <p>Are you sure it&rsquo;s able to fulfill its obligation to you?</p>
      <p>While your broker makes sure that you can pay if it wins (and you lose), it&rsquo;s also important that&nbsp;<strong>you make sure that your broker can pay up if you win (and it loses)</strong>!</p>
      <p>Spider-Man also vanished without returning the $200 that was used as collateral so Batman also ended up losing all of the funds that he gave to Ant-Man.</p>
      <p>Spider-Man ran (jumped?) away with Batman&rsquo;s money never to be seen again until his next movie.</p>
      <p>Legitimate forex brokers would prefer to stay in business, rather than go bust or disappear with your funds.&nbsp;Unlike shady Spider-Man, they do have ways to manage this risk.</p>
      <p>In a later lesson, we&rsquo;re going to look under the hood and explain to you what actually happens when a forex broker executes your orders. You&rsquo;ll learn how forex brokers manage their risk so they don&rsquo;t go bust.</p>
      <p>But this is just one (of several) things to carefully consider when choosing your forex broker.</p>
      <p>In order to properly evaluate retail forex brokers, it&rsquo;s important to know how a typical retail forex broker operates so here&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ll cover:</p>
      <h3>Who are you trading with?</h3>
      <p>Unlike Batman in the story above, you&rsquo;re not going to know who you are trading with. And even if you did, that doesn&rsquo;t mean you should blindly trust them. Even Batman was duped by a fellow superhero, who was supposedly a &ldquo;good guy&rdquo;.</p>
      <p>Your forex broker is a faceless corporate entity that requires you to send it money so you can open trades with it.</p>
      <p>Are you sure they are who they say they are? Is it a legitimate company that really provides forex trading services? Or is it a fake fore broker? How do you know the company won&rsquo;t just take your money and disappear?</p>
      <p>Who are you really trading with? Is it a reputable broker?</p>
      <h3>What are you actually trading?</h3>
      <p>Notice how Spider-Man or Batman didn&rsquo;t actually own any British pounds. No actual pounds were ever exchanged. They were simply making dollar-denominated bets on the&nbsp;<strong>price fluctuations</strong>&nbsp;of GBP/USD.</p>
      <p>So if you&rsquo;re not actually buying or selling,&nbsp;<em>what</em>&nbsp;are you trading?</p>
      <h3>Where are you actually trading?</h3>
      <p>Notice how Spider-Man created a &ldquo;market&rdquo; (to bet on the price direction of GBP/USD) for Batman with just his imagination?</p>
      <p>Did you also notice how there were only two parties involved?</p>
      <p>Whenever Batman made a bet, Spider-Man did not go out into the &ldquo;market&rdquo; and search for another person to take the opposite side of the bet.</p>
      <p>Spider-Man simply took the opposite side of ALL of Batman&rsquo;s bets.</p>
      <p>As long as both agreed on the terms, real bets were made and were expected to be honored. Nobody else was involved.</p>
      <p>So if you&rsquo;re not trading in the &ldquo;market&rdquo;,&nbsp;<em>where</em>&nbsp;are you trading?</p>
      <h3>How do forex brokers manage their risk?</h3>
      <p>During the last bet made between Spider-Man and Batman, notice how the price of GBP/USD moved unfavorably against Spider-Man and he ended up not having the money to pay?</p>
      <p>Because Spider-Man is the sole person taking the opposite side of Batman&rsquo;s bet, Batman should&rsquo;ve made sure that Spider-Man would be good for the money.</p>
      <p>The same concern should be made with retail forex brokers since they operate in a similar fashion.</p>
      <p>So if your forex broker is always taking the opposite side of your trades, how does it avoid the risk of going bust? And taking your money down with it?</p>
      <h3>Are the prices that your forex broker quotes you fair?</h3>
      <p>Notice how Spider-Man can quote any price he wants?</p>
      <p>Fortunately, Batman was smart enough to use his Batphone and reference a third-party data source (Google) to verify if&nbsp;the price that Spider-Man was using was accurate.</p>
      <p>But what if he didn&rsquo;t? Once the bet was made, Spider-Man could continue to make up prices in his favor. For example, he could say that GBP/USD has fallen 500 pips (even though it hasn&rsquo;t), and Batman would be forced to bet at a loss.</p>
      <p>So if your forex broker is able to quote you any price it wants, how do you know that the prices you see on the trading platform are fair? Where do the&nbsp;<em>prices</em>&nbsp;come from?</p>
      <h3>What is the quality of your forex broker&rsquo;s order execution?</h3>
      <p>Notice how Batman wanted to open a bet when the starting price of GBP/USD was at 1.4100, but Spider-Man declined and changed the price to 1.4150 instead?</p>
      <p>This is known as&nbsp;<strong>slippage</strong>.</p>
      <p>Slippage is the difference between the expected price of a trade and the price at which the trade is actually executed.</p>
      <p>Slippage can occur for a number of different reasons and can work for and against a trader.</p>
      <p>In Batman&rsquo;s case, he experienced&nbsp;<strong>negative slippage</strong>, which is when Spider-Man gave him a worse price than expected. This results in a smaller profit or a larger loss.</p>
      <p>Being quoted a specific price, even if it&rsquo;s accurate and fair, means NOTHING if your order can&rsquo;t execute at said price.</p>
      <p>How can you determine the quality of its order execution? Where orders will be executed at your requested prices?</p>
      <p>We will cover these topics in detail (and more) in the following lessons.</p>
