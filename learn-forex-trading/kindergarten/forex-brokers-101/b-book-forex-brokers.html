    <p>When the retail forex broker takes the opposite of a customer&rsquo;s trade, it can choose to&nbsp;<strong>ACCEPT the market risk or TRANSFER it to another market participant</strong>.</p>
    <p>If a broker chooses to accept the market risk, when the trade is executed, it is called &ldquo;<strong>B-Book execution</strong>&rdquo;.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;B-Book execution&rdquo; is just a fancy phrase for&nbsp;<strong>taking the opposite of your trade</strong>.</p>
    <p>Your trade can also be described as being &ldquo;<strong>B-Booked</strong>&rdquo;.</p>
    <p>And since the broker has taken on risk, here are other examples of industry jargon:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>The risk has been &ldquo;<strong>internalized</strong>&rdquo;.</li>
    <li>The risk has been &ldquo;<strong>warehoused</strong>&rdquo;.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Because the broker has decided to &ldquo;hold&rdquo; the risk, it has kept the risk for itself (&ldquo;internalized&rdquo;) and stored the risk (&ldquo;warehoused&rdquo;).</p>
    <p>Not sure if market risk appreciates being objectified. ðŸ˜‚</p>
    <p>Depending on whether the market moves for or against the broker,&nbsp;<strong>accepting market risk can either be good OR bad for the broker</strong>.</p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s look at an example of each.</p>
    <h2>B-Book Order Execution Example #1: Broker Wins</h2>
    <p><img title="B-Book Forex Broker Wins" src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/06/01211611/b-book-example-broker-wins.png" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" srcset="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/06/01211611/b-book-example-broker-wins.png 600w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/06/01211611/b-book-example-broker-wins-355x360.png 355w" alt="B-Book Forex Broker Wins" width="600" height="608" /></p>
    <p>In the example above, Elsa went long 100,000 EUR/USD at 1.1500. Her broker &ldquo;B-Booked&rdquo; (took the opposite of) the trade and is short 100,000 EUR/USD.</p>
    <p>EUR/USD falls to&nbsp;<strong>1.1400</strong>.</p>
    <p>Elsa can&rsquo;t take the pain any longer and closes her position by selling 100,000 EUR/USD at 1.14000.</p>
    <p>She ends up with a&nbsp;<strong>$1,000 loss</strong></p>
    <pre>P&amp;L = (Exit Price - Entry Price) x Position Size
    -1,000 = ((1.1400 - 1.1500) x 100,000)</pre>
    <p>On the other hand, the broker ends up with a&nbsp;<strong>$1,000 profit</strong>.</p>
    <pre>P&amp;L = (Entry Price - Exit Price) x Position Size
    1,000 = ((1.1500 - 1.1400) x 100,000)</pre>
    <p>In this scenario, for accepting the market risk, the broker was rewarded with a&nbsp;<strong>PROFIT</strong>.</p>
    <p>It was a positive outcome.</p>
    <h2>B-Book Order Execution Example #2: Broker Loses</h2>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s now take a look at what happens when the&nbsp;<strong>market moves AGAINST the broker</strong>.</p>
    <p><img title="B-Book Forex Broker Loses" src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/06/01211638/b-book-example-broker-loses.png" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" srcset="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/06/01211638/b-book-example-broker-loses.png 600w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/06/01211638/b-book-example-broker-loses-355x360.png 355w" alt="B-Book Forex Broker Loses" width="600" height="608" /></p>
    <p>In the example above, Elsa went long 100,000 EUR/USD at 1.1500. Her broker &ldquo;B-Booked&rdquo; (took the opposite of) the trade and is short 100,000 EUR/USD.</p>
    <p>EUR/USD rises 200 pips to 1.1700.</p>
    <p>Elsa decides to take profit and closes her position by selling 100,000 EUR/USD at 1.17000.</p>
    <p>She ends up with a&nbsp;<strong>$2,000 profit</strong></p>
    <pre>P&amp;L = (Exit Price - Entry Price) x Position Size
    2,000 = ((1.1700 - 1.1500) x 100,000)</pre>
    <p>On the other hand, the broker ends up with a&nbsp;<strong>$2,000 loss</strong>.</p>
    <pre>P&amp;L = (Entry Price - Exit Price) x Position Size
    -2,000 = ((1.1500 - 1.1700) x 100,000)</pre>
    <p>In this scenario, for accepting the market risk, the broker suffered a&nbsp;<strong>LOSS</strong>.</p>
    <p>It was a negative outcome.</p>
    <p>Here&rsquo;s a summary of how a B-Book broker benefits depending on the outcome of a trade:</p>
    <div>
    <div>
    <table border="1px">
    <tbody>
    <tr>
    <td><strong>Customer&rsquo;s Trade</strong></td>
    <td><strong>Broker&rsquo;s Order Execution</strong></td>
    <td><strong>Benefit</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Win</td>
    <td>B-Book (Accept risk)</td>
    <td>Customer&rsquo;s gain is broker&rsquo;s loss</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Lose</td>
    <td>B-Book (Accept risk)</td>
    <td>Customer&rsquo;s loss is broker&rsquo;s gain</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>
    </div>
    </div>
    <h2>Potential Conflict of Interest</h2>
    <p>There is a lot of controversy with B-Book execution.</p>
    <p>Since your broker makes money if you lose money, there exists a potential conflict of interest.</p>
    <p>It creates the potential for the broker to do &ldquo;bad&rdquo; things to increase the chances that your trades lose.</p>
    <p>This causes traders to be concerned about shady behavior from brokers who don&rsquo;t want their customers winning.</p>
    <p>We won&rsquo;t go into examples of broker shadiness just yet since the focus of this lesson is&nbsp;<strong>how forex brokers manage their market risk</strong>&nbsp;(not how shady brokers take advantage of their customers).</p>
    <p>For now, just know that when a forex broker chooses to&nbsp;<strong>accept market risk</strong>&nbsp;(&ldquo;B-Book execution&rdquo;), a major downside to doing this is that a potential conflict of interest does exist between a broker and its customers.</p>
    <p>In the next lesson, we&rsquo;ll learn another way that a broker manages market risk:&nbsp;<strong>by&nbsp;<em>transferring</em>&nbsp;it</strong>&nbsp;(or &ldquo;A-Book execution&rdquo;).</p>
