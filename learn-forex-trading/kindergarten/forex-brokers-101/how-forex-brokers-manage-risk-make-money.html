    <p>A lot of retail traders have no idea of how an order is processed or how forex brokers or CFD providers really operate.</p>
    <p>This lesson is intended as an introduction to the mechanics behind retail forex trading.</p>
    <p>It is aimed at forex traders wishing to gain a practical understanding of how forex brokers manage their risk and make money.</p>
    <p>The trading process is not always transparent, and there are multiple ways in which an order can be executed with different risks associated with each.</p>
    <p>If you take the time to understand how orders are executed, then you&rsquo;ll be able to differentiate between forex brokers and can make a more informed decision when choosing one.</p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s begin!&nbsp;üí™</p>
    <h2>Counterparties</h2>
    <p>When you place a trade order in your broker&rsquo;s trading platform, and the order gets executed or &ldquo;filled&rdquo;, where does the trade go?</p>
    <p><img title="Where does my trade go?" src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/05/23205117/where-does-my-trade-go-360x288.png" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" srcset="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/05/23205117/where-does-my-trade-go-360x288.png 360w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/05/23205117/where-does-my-trade-go-768x615.png 768w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/05/23205117/where-does-my-trade-go-780x625.png 780w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/05/23205117/where-does-my-trade-go.png 1024w" alt="Where does my trade go?" width="360" height="288" /></p>
    <p>It actually goes&nbsp;<em><strong>nowhere</strong></em>.</p>
    <p>The definition of a&nbsp;<strong>broker</strong>&nbsp;is an intermediary that executes a trade on behalf of its clients. While the definition of a&nbsp;<strong>dealer</strong>&nbsp;is a person or entity that trades on its own account.</p>
    <p>Retail forex brokers do NOT trade on behalf of their customers. They are&nbsp;<strong>dealers</strong>.</p>
    <p>A retail forex broker trades on its own account by taking the opposite side of its customers&rsquo; trades.</p>
    <p>The term &ldquo;forex broker&rdquo; is really a marketing phrase since&nbsp;<strong>retail forex &ldquo;brokers&rdquo; are actually retail forex&nbsp;<em>dealers</em>.&nbsp;üò±</strong></p>
    <p>For example, all retail forex brokers regulated in the U.S. are formally referred to as &ldquo;<strong>Retail Foreign Exchange Dealers</strong>&rdquo; or RFEDs<strong>.</strong></p>
    <p>So why do retail forex dealers market themselves as &ldquo;forex brokers&rdquo;?</p>
    <p>Maybe because it sounds better? Sounds friendlier?</p>
    <p>Who knows.&nbsp;&macr;\_(„ÉÑ)_/&macr;</p>
    <p>The main point is&nbsp;if we wanted to be technically accurate, we&nbsp;<em>should</em>&nbsp;be using the phrase, &ldquo;<strong>forex dealers</strong>&ldquo;.</p>
    <p>But since the phrase, &ldquo;forex brokers&rdquo; is so popular and has been seared into everyone&rsquo;s minds already due to effective&nbsp;<del>brainwashing</del>&nbsp;marketing, going forward we&rsquo;ll still refer to them as &ldquo;forex brokers&rdquo;. (Good job marketing folks from the retail forex industry!&nbsp;üëè)</p>
    <div>
    <p><strong>CLIENT or CUSTOMER?</strong></p>
    <p>Are you a&nbsp;<strong>client</strong>&nbsp;of a forex broker? Or are you a&nbsp;<strong>customer</strong>&nbsp;of a forex broker?&ldquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Client&rdquo; and &ldquo;customer&rdquo; are words that are often used interchangeably.</p>
    <p>For our purposes, we think there&rsquo;s a&nbsp;<strong>distinct difference</strong>&nbsp;between being a client and being a customer.</p>
    <p>Being a client of a company means there is a&nbsp;<strong>fiduciary relationship</strong>&nbsp;between you and the company. This means that the company acts on your behalf and is obligated by law to act in your best interest.</p>
    <p><strong>But a forex broker does not act on your behalf, nor is it obligated to act in your best interest.</strong></p>
    <p>So if we go by the definition that being a client means there is a fiduciary relationship, then this means that you are NOT a client of your &ldquo;forex broker&rdquo;.</p>
    <p>You are a&nbsp;<strong>customer</strong>.</p>
    <p>If you want to buy, the service it provides isn&rsquo;t to act on your befall and find you a seller. It&rsquo;s the one selling to you.</p>
    <p>How can you be a &ldquo;client&rdquo; when it is the broker itself selling to or buying from you?</p>
    <p>You are a customer of your &ldquo;forex broker&rdquo; who provides a service that enables you to speculate (make bets) on the price movements of currency pairs.</p>
    <p>Since you can&rsquo;t trade directly in the (institutional) FX market, it &ldquo;makes&rdquo; a trading market for you.</p>
    <p>It provides you a way to make bets on currency prices by always taking the opposite of your bets whenever you want to make one. It&rsquo;s not trying to find someone to take the other side of the bet, it simply takes the bet on itself.</p>
    <p>But the &ldquo;forex broker&rdquo; does not have the fiduciary duty to act for your benefit.</p>
    <p>That said, even though there is NOT a fiduciary relationship with the customer, the forex broker should&nbsp;<strong>act honestly and fairly</strong>&nbsp;with all of its customers.</p>
    <p>Going forward, we will use the term &ldquo;<strong>customers</strong>&rdquo; when referring to traders using the services of a retail forex broker or CFD provider.</p>
    </div>
    <p>All orders and trades entered through your broker&rsquo;s trading platform are NOT executed on an external trading venue but are executed by the broker itself.</p>
    <p>Your &ldquo;broker&rdquo; is taking the opposite side of your trade.</p>
    <p>This is known as being the&nbsp;<strong>counterparty</strong>.</p>
    <p>Think about it. If you want to buy, someone has to sell. And if you want to sell, someone has to buy.</p>
    <p><strong>Every buyer must be paired with a seller and vice versa</strong>.</p>
    <p>You need a counterparty.</p>
    <p>When you trade with a broker, both you and the &ldquo;broker&rdquo; hold positions against each other.</p>
    <p>You are each other&rsquo;s counterparties.</p>
    <p>You are your broker&rsquo;s counterparty. Your broker is your counterparty.</p>
    <p>This means that if you want to&nbsp;<strong>buy or &ldquo;go long&rdquo;</strong>, the broker will take the opposite side of your trade and&nbsp;<strong>sell to you or &ldquo;go short&rdquo;</strong>.</p>
    <p><img title="Trader is Long, Broker is Short" src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/04/26095504/long-position.png" sizes="(max-width: 466px) 100vw, 466px" srcset="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/04/26095504/long-position.png 466w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/04/26095504/long-position-360x164.png 360w" alt="Trader is Long, Broker is Short" width="466" height="212" /></p>
    <p>The same thing happens if you want to sell or &ldquo;go short&rdquo;, the broker will take the opposite side of your trade and buy from you or &ldquo;go long&rdquo;.</p>
    <p><img title="Trader is Short, Broker is Long" src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/04/26095541/short-position.png" sizes="(max-width: 466px) 100vw, 466px" srcset="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/04/26095541/short-position.png 466w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/04/26095541/short-position-360x164.png 360w" alt="Trader is Short, Broker is Long" width="466" height="212" /></p>
    <p>Your order is known as a&nbsp;<strong>bilateral</strong>&nbsp;transaction with your broker. &ldquo;Bilateral&rdquo; is just a fancy word that just means &ldquo;involving two parties&rdquo;.</p>
    <p>All retail forex trades are bilateral since your retail forex &ldquo;broker &ldquo;is the counterparty to ALL of your trades.</p>
    <h2>Example 1: Single Trader and Broker</h2>
    <p>For example, if you buy 100,000 GBP/USD, or open a &ldquo;long&rdquo; position, your broker takes the opposite side of your trade.</p>
    <p>This means it will sell 100,000 GBP/USD or hold a &ldquo;short&rdquo; position against you.</p>
    <p><img title="Long GBPUSD Position" src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/04/26095706/long-gbpusd-position.png" sizes="(max-width: 466px) 100vw, 466px" srcset="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/04/26095706/long-gbpusd-position.png 466w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/04/26095706/long-gbpusd-position-360x173.png 360w" alt="Long GBPUSD Position" width="466" height="224" /></p>
    <p>Since you are now &ldquo;long&rdquo; GBP/USD, you are now exposed to the potential risk that the price for GBP/USD will decrease and you end up having to close your position by selling at a lower price than you bought it for, resulting in a loss.</p>
    <p>The broker who is now &ldquo;short&rdquo; GBP/USD, is also exposed to risk. But in its case, the risk is that the price for GBP/USD will increase. If GBP/USD continues to rise, the more the broker&rsquo;s loss grows.</p>
    <p>This risk is called&nbsp;<strong>market risk</strong>.</p>
    <p><strong>Market risk is the risk of a loss in a position caused by adverse price movements.</strong></p>
    <p>When you initiate a trade with your broker, both you (the trader) and the broker are exposed to market risk.</p>
    <p>As you can see, your trade never reaches the &ldquo;market&rdquo;. It stays as a private agreement between you and your &ldquo;broker&rdquo;.</p>
    <p>This why your forex broker is not really a broker. It is a DEALER.</p>
    <p>If it was a true broker, it would find and match your trade with another counterparty.&nbsp;For example, if you want to buy, the broker would find someone who wants to sell.</p>
    <p>But it doesn&rsquo;t do this. If you want to buy, It is the one that sells to you.</p>
    <p>Since a retail forex broker is THE counterparty for ALL of its traders (&ldquo;customers&rdquo;), this means that it holds A LOT of positions for different currency pairs.</p>
    <p>In order to understand the market risk for a specific currency pair, we need to add ALL of the broker&rsquo;s positions against traders in this currency pair.</p>
    <h2>Example 2: Two Traders and Broker</h2>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s pretend that there are two&nbsp;<del>princess</del>&nbsp;traders: Elsa and Ariel.</p>
    <p>They both trade GBP/USD but have different opinions on where the price is headed.</p>
    <p>Elsa goes long GBP/USD, while Ariel goes short GBP/USD.</p>
    <p><img title="Two Traders Long GBPUSD" src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/04/26095957/two-traders-long-gbpusd.png" sizes="(max-width: 466px) 100vw, 466px" srcset="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/04/26095957/two-traders-long-gbpusd.png 466w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/04/26095957/two-traders-long-gbpusd-360x268.png 360w" alt="Two Traders Long GBPUSD" width="466" height="347" /></p>
    <p>The broker takes the opposite side of each trade.</p>
    <p>Remember, the broker is the sole counterparty to all its customers&rsquo; trades.</p>
    <p>Each trader trades directly (&ldquo;bilaterally&rdquo;) with the broker, and only the retail broker.&nbsp;<strong>Retail forex traders do not trade with each other</strong>.</p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s see how Elsa&rsquo;s and Ariel&rsquo;s trades affect the broker&rsquo;s trading book.</p>
    <p>A trading book, or &ldquo;<strong>book</strong>&rdquo; for short, keeps track of all the open positions that a broker holds.</p>
    <p>Whenever its customers trade, the broker has to take the opposite side of the trade. This causes the trading book to constantly change and &ldquo;net&rdquo; long (or short) positions in individual currencies to arise.</p>
    <p>The broker must continuously keep track of its long and short positions and know its net positions precisely at all times.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>A &ldquo;book&rdquo; is a record of all the positions held by a trader. Retail traders may also refer to their own positions as a book, although the term is mostly associated with institutional traders.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>As a trader, you have your own &ldquo;book&rdquo; as well. Your book is simply all your open positions as well.<img title="Broker's Net Position is Zero" src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/06/01202335/broker-net-zero-position.png" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" srcset="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/06/01202335/broker-net-zero-position.png 700w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/06/01202335/broker-net-zero-position-360x309.png 360w" alt="Broker's Net Position is Zero" width="700" height="600" /></p>
    <p>As you can see above, even though both Elsa and Ariel have open positions against the broker, the broker&rsquo;s net position is&nbsp;<strong>zero</strong>.</p>
    <p>The broker has a short position against Elsa&rsquo;s trade but also has a long position against Ariel&rsquo;s trade.</p>
    <p>The two trades&nbsp;<strong>offset</strong>&nbsp;each other which results in the broker&rsquo;s exposure to market risk being eliminated.</p>
    <p>Assuming this is all the GBP/USD positions that the broker has on its book, its&nbsp;<strong>market risk exposure is zero</strong>.</p>
    <p>Of course, the broker has to make money so it quotes a different price depending on whether the customer wants to buy or sell. The difference between the two prices is known as the&nbsp;<strong>spread</strong>.<img title="Forex Broker's Spread" src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/06/01202533/brokers-spread.png" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" srcset="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/06/01202533/brokers-spread.png 700w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/06/01202533/brokers-spread-360x309.png 360w" alt="Forex Broker's Spread" width="700" height="600" /></p>
    <p>In the example above, Elsa bought GBP/USD at 1.2503, known as the &ldquo;<strong>ask</strong>&rdquo; price, while Ariel sold GBP/USD at 1.2500, known as the &ldquo;<strong>bid</strong>&rdquo; price.</p>
    <p>This means the broker&rsquo;s spread was&nbsp;<strong>3 pips</strong>&nbsp;or 0.0003 (1.2503 &ndash; 1.2500).</p>
    <p>Basically, the broker bought GBP/USD from Ariel at&nbsp;<strong>1.2500</strong>&nbsp;and turned right around and sold GBP/USD to Elsa at the higher price of&nbsp;<strong>1.2503</strong>, pocketing the spread.</p>
    <p><strong>This spread is the broker&rsquo;s profi</strong>t, which equals $30 (0.0003 x 100,000).</p>
    <p>At this point, it doesn&rsquo;t matter if the market fluctuates widely since the&nbsp;<strong>broker&rsquo;s net position is zero</strong>, The market is locked in due to the offsetting trades.</p>
    <p>For example, Elsa bought GBP/USD at 1.2503 and Ariel sold GBP/USD at 1.2500 and the current market price is now&nbsp;<strong>1.3100</strong>.</p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s calculate the broker&rsquo;s P&amp;L (profit and loss):</p>
    <pre>P&amp;L = 100,000 (1.2503 - 1.3100) + 100,000 (1.3100 - 1.2500)
    P&amp;L = -5,970 + 6,000
    P&amp;L = 30
    </pre>
    <p>The broker has a profit of<strong>&nbsp;$30</strong>.</p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s see what happens if the current market price plunges to<strong>&nbsp;1.2900</strong>.</p>
    <pre>P&amp;L = 100,000 (1.2503 - 1.2900) + 100,000 (1.2900 - 1.2500)
    P&amp;L = -3970 + 4000
    P&amp;L = 30
    </pre>
    <p>As you can see, even when the price moved 200 pips (from 1.3100 to 1.2900) because the two trades offset each other,&nbsp;<strong>the broker was NOT exposed to market risk and its profit remained at $30</strong>.</p>
    <h2>Example 3: Many Traders and Broker</h2>
    <p>Now instead of just two traders, let&rsquo;s add more traders.</p>
    <p>There are 1,000 traders and ALL of them go long 1 standard lot (or 100,000 units) of GBP/USD each.</p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s see how the broker&rsquo;s book looks now.<img title="Forex Broker is Net Short 100M" src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/06/01202831/broker-net-short-100-million.png" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" srcset="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/06/01202831/broker-net-short-100-million.png 700w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/06/01202831/broker-net-short-100-million-210x360.png 210w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/06/01202831/broker-net-short-100-million-455x780.png 455w" alt="Forex Broker is Net Short 100M" width="700" height="1200" /></p>
    <p>Whoa.</p>
    <p>As you can see, the broker is&nbsp;<strong>net short 100&nbsp;<em>million</em>&nbsp;units</strong>&nbsp;of GBP/USD.</p>
    <p>(1,000 traders x 100,000 units = 100,000,0000 units)</p>
    <p>There weren&rsquo;t any other traders who wanted to short GBP/USD so the broker wasn&rsquo;t able to offset any positions to help reduce his net short position.</p>
    <p>That kind of exposure to market risk is pretty BIG.</p>
    <p>How big?</p>
    <p>If a 1-pip move for a standard lot or a 100,000 unit position equals $10, this means that for a 10M unit position,&nbsp;<strong>every pip increase that GBP/USD makes, the broker experiences a $10,000 unrealized loss</strong>.</p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s repeat that:&nbsp;<strong>1 pip increase = $10,000 unrealized loss</strong>.</p>
    <p>So if GBP/USD rises 100 pips, the broker would be down&nbsp;<strong>$1,000,000</strong>!</p>
    <p>In theory, the broker could stop accepting the trades if it didn&rsquo;t want to expose itself to such risk but then that would mean that all of its customers couldn&rsquo;t enter into any more trades.</p>
    <p>That&rsquo;s the equivalent of a store hanging up a &ldquo;Closed&rdquo; sign in the middle of the day when its customers expect the store to be open for business. If all of a sudden, traders couldn&rsquo;t open trades on the broker&rsquo;s trading platform, they&rsquo;d be like &ldquo;WTF?&rdquo; and be pissed.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/05/23210645/angry-trader-360x360.png" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" srcset="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/05/23210645/angry-trader-360x360.png 360w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/05/23210645/angry-trader-150x150.png 150w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/05/23210645/angry-trader.png 512w" alt="Angry Trader" width="360" height="360" /></p>
    <p>So not accepting trades is out of the question. The broker must stay &ldquo;Open&rdquo; or it would lose customers. It must continue to accept trades.</p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s pretend<strong>&nbsp;EVERY trader closed their trade after GBP/USD rose 100 pips</strong>.</p>
    <p>Each trader would have a&nbsp;<strong>$1,000 profit</strong>&nbsp;(100 pips x $10).</p>
    <p>And since the broker was the counterparty to all 1,000 traders, it would have a&nbsp;<strong>realized loss of $1,000,000</strong>&nbsp;($1,000 x 1,000 customers).</p>
    <p>The question then arises&hellip;</p>
    <p>Does the broker actually have a $1M to pay out to its winning customers?</p>
    <p>If it doesn&rsquo;t, along with some very angry customers, it will be out of business.</p>
    <p>In this scenario, if the broker doesn&rsquo;t have the funds,&nbsp;<strong>it did not manage its market risk properly</strong>.</p>
    <p>The price moved against the broker&rsquo;s net position so much that it wasn&rsquo;t able to fulfill its obligations to its customers and pay out their profits.</p>
    <p>The broker&rsquo;s overexposure to market risk has now exposed the traders (its customers) to c<strong>ounterparty risk</strong>.</p>
    <p>Counterparty risk is when one party fails to deliver on its end of the deal.</p>
    <p>In this scenario, when the traders exited their long positions, they expected to receive their profit in their account.</p>
    <p>But the broker took on too much risk and doesn&rsquo;t have enough money to pay out.</p>
    <p><img title="Forex Broker Goes Bust" src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/06/01205439/insolvent-broker-360x360.png" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" srcset="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/06/01205439/insolvent-broker-360x360.png 360w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/06/01205439/insolvent-broker-150x150.png 150w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/06/01205439/insolvent-broker.png 512w" alt="Forex Broker Goes Bust" width="360" height="360" /></p>
    <p>In casino lingo, &ldquo;<strong>The house has gone bust</strong>.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>This is why it&rsquo;s important to know how your broker manages the risk on the other side of your trade.</p>
    <p>There are three ways for the broker to manage market risk:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>It can&nbsp;<strong>offset</strong>&nbsp;opposing trades from its customers.</li>
    <li>It can&nbsp;<strong>transfer</strong>&nbsp;or &ldquo;offload&rdquo; the risk to another market participant.</li>
    <li>It can&nbsp;<strong>accept</strong>&nbsp;or &ldquo;warehouse&rdquo; the risk.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/05/23220716/ways-to-manage-market-risk.png" sizes="(max-width: 592px) 100vw, 592px" srcset="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/05/23220716/ways-to-manage-market-risk.png 592w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/05/23220716/ways-to-manage-market-risk-360x123.png 360w" alt="Three Ways to Manage Market Risk" width="592" height="202" /></p>
    <p><strong>HOW a forex broker manages market risk determines what type of broker it is and how it operates as a business.&nbsp;</strong></p>
    <p>Understanding the concept of your broker &ldquo;taking risk&rdquo; on your order is critical to your success as a trader.</p>
    <p>If your broker is taking the other side of your order and not passing it onto an external counterparty, your broker is taking&nbsp;<strong>100% of the market risk</strong>&nbsp;associated with your order.</p>
