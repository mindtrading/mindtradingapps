    <p>A-Book brokers are sometimes also marketed as &ldquo;STP brokers&rdquo;.</p>
    <p>But that&rsquo;s actually inaccurate.</p>
    <p>While they&rsquo;re both similar in the sense that they both&nbsp;<strong>transfer market risk</strong>, they are actually two different ways to execute an order.</p>
    <p>In this lesson, we will explain the difference between A-Book&nbsp;and STP execution.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;<strong>Straight-Through Processing</strong>&rdquo; is a term that is commonly shortened to &ldquo;STP&rdquo;.</p>
    <p>You may have seen this acronym mentioned by some forex brokers on their websites.</p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s important to know that the term&nbsp;<strong>STP (Straight-Through Processing)&nbsp;</strong>has been hijacked by the retail forex trading industry and given a different meaning.</p>
    <p>Originally, STP was a term introduced when electronic trading became available back in the day. It described the procedure that companies use to optimize the speed at which they process transactions.</p>
    <p>Electronic trading enables &ldquo;straight-through processing&rdquo; (STP), by which trades entered&nbsp;<em><strong>electronically</strong>&nbsp;</em>can likewise be processed (cleared and settled)&nbsp;<em><strong>electronically</strong></em>. Because STP involves no paperwork and little human intervention, errors are mostly eliminated which dramatically lowers operational costs and risk.</p>
    <p>In a nutshell,&nbsp;<strong>STP enables the entire trade process to be conducted electronically without the need for re-keying or manual intervention</strong>.</p>
    <p>That&rsquo;s how STP was originally defined, but then the retail forex industry decided to get creative with its usage.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/06/05204852/stp-broker-innovation-360x360.png" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" srcset="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/06/05204852/stp-broker-innovation-360x360.png 360w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/06/05204852/stp-broker-innovation-150x150.png 150w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/06/05204852/stp-broker-innovation.png 640w" alt="STP Used as Marketing Tool" width="360" height="360" /></p>
    <p>Nowadays, it&rsquo;s used as marketing&nbsp;<del>innovation</del>&nbsp;jargon to imply that the forex broker is not &ldquo;touching&rdquo; or interfering with your orders nor benefitting from your losses because it supposedly &ldquo;routes (or sends) your orders&nbsp;<em>straight through</em>&nbsp;to the market.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>As you&rsquo;ve already learned,&nbsp;<em>your</em>&nbsp;orders are&nbsp;<strong>never routed or sent to the &ldquo;market&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;because your forex broker is your sole counterparty and always takes the opposite of your trade.</p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s see how &ldquo;STP&rdquo; execution actually works.</p>
    <h2>A-Book vs. STP</h2>
    <p>A trade that is &ldquo;<strong>A-Booked</strong>&rdquo; is sometimes associated with being &ldquo;<strong>STP&rsquo;ed</strong>&rdquo; or simply &ldquo;<strong>STP</strong>&rdquo;.</p>
    <p>Forex brokers may use them interchangeably in their marketing but they are NOT the same thing.</p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s important to distinguish between the two concepts.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>STP is known as &ldquo;<strong>pre-trade hedging</strong>&rdquo;.</li>
    <li>A-Book is known as &ldquo;<strong>post-trade hedging</strong>&rdquo;.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Depending on whether your broker is an &ldquo;A-Book broker&rdquo; or an &ldquo;STP broker&rdquo;, your experience on&nbsp;<strong>how your order is executed will be different</strong>.</p>
    <p>With an A-book broker, you will experience&nbsp;<strong>faster order execution and minimal slippage</strong>.</p>
    <p><img title="A-Book Order Execution" src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/04/26114507/a-book-trade-execution-780x200.png" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" srcset="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/04/26114507/a-book-trade-execution-780x200.png 780w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/04/26114507/a-book-trade-execution-768x197.png 768w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/04/26114507/a-book-trade-execution-360x92.png 360w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/04/26114507/a-book-trade-execution.png 1165w" alt="A-Book Order Execution" width="780" height="200" /></p>
    <p>This is because the broker will execute your trade&nbsp;<em>first</em>, and then hedge. Hence, why it&rsquo;s known as &ldquo;post-trade hedging&rdquo;.</p>
    <p>With an STP broker, you will experience<strong>&nbsp;slower order execution and a higher probability of slippage</strong>.</p>
    <p><img title="STP Order Execution" src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/04/26114558/stp-trade-execution-780x200.png" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" srcset="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/04/26114558/stp-trade-execution-780x200.png 780w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/04/26114558/stp-trade-execution-768x197.png 768w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/04/26114558/stp-trade-execution-360x92.png 360w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/04/26114558/stp-trade-execution.png 1165w" alt="STP Order Execution" width="780" height="200" /></p>
    <p>This is because the broker will make sure to &ldquo;lock in&rdquo; its matching order with the LP&nbsp;<em>first</em>, and then execute your order. Hence, why it&rsquo;s known as &ldquo;<strong>pre</strong>-trade hedging&rdquo;.</p>
    <p>When your broker executes an offsetting position with a counterparty PRIOR to executing your order, this is known as &ldquo;s<strong>traight-through processing</strong>&rdquo; or &ldquo;<strong>STP</strong>&rdquo;.</p>
    <p>Why would a broker &ldquo;STP&rdquo; orders instead of &ldquo;A-Booking&rdquo;?</p>
    <p>The benefit of straight-through processing for the broker is that it eliminates slippage&nbsp;<strong>between its customers&rsquo; order fills and hedged trade</strong>.</p>
    <p>Slippage (or price slippage) refers to the difference between the<strong>&nbsp;EXPECTED price</strong>&nbsp;before an order is executed and the&nbsp;<strong>ACTUAL price</strong>&nbsp;at which it is executed.</p>
    <p>In trading lingo<strong>, slippage refers to the difference between the&nbsp;<em>requested</em>&nbsp;price and the price at which an order is actually&nbsp;<em>filled</em>.</strong></p>
    <p>Slippage typically occurs around times of news or economic announcements and extreme market volatility and can be either&nbsp;<strong>positive</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>negative</strong>.</p>
    <p>In a rapidly changing market and/or in the event of order transmission delays, the price presented to you may no longer remain in effect at the time your order is executed.</p>
    <p>This difference between the two prices is what&rsquo;s commonly referred to as &ldquo;slippage.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>If slippage occurs, your broker does not re-quote a price to you. Rather, your order would be executed&nbsp;<strong>at the prevailing price</strong>&nbsp;at the time the order is received regardless of the direction in which the market has moved.</p>
    <p>Slippage is&nbsp;<strong>symmetrical.&nbsp;</strong>This means that experiencing price slippage&nbsp;is just as likely to be to your&nbsp;<strong>advantage</strong>&nbsp;or to your&nbsp;<strong>disadvantage</strong>.</p>
    <p>In order to prevent the order execution price from slipping too far from your intended price, most brokers allow you to include &ldquo;<strong>bounds&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;with your market or entry order.</p>
    <p>In that case, your order will not be executed if the price at the time your order is received falls outside of the specified bounds.</p>
    <p>For example, if the broker is quoting you a buy (ask) price of EUR/USD at&nbsp;<strong>1.1000</strong>, it wants to make sure it&rsquo;s able to buy EUR/USD at a&nbsp;<em>lower</em>&nbsp;price with an LP, say&nbsp;<strong>1.0999</strong>.</p>
    <p>STP allows the broker to ensure that it is able to &ldquo;secure&rdquo; this price&nbsp;<strong><em>before</em>&nbsp;it confirms its order with you</strong>. Otherwise, if it doesn&rsquo;t, it might LOSE money on the hedge trade!</p>
    <p><strong>But while the possibility of slippage for the broker is eliminated, the possibility for slippage for YOU (the customer) has increased.</strong></p>
    <p>If the price that was confirmed with the LP is different from the one you sent, this is the price that your order will execute, which may be&nbsp;<strong>better</strong>&nbsp;(&ldquo;positive slippage&rdquo;) or&nbsp;<strong>worse</strong>&nbsp;(&ldquo;negative slippage&rdquo;) than what you had expected.</p>
    <p>Execution speed is&nbsp;<strong>slower</strong>&nbsp;because before the broker can confirm your trade, it FIRST must receive confirmation from its LP regarding its trade.</p>
    <p>During this process, it&rsquo;s possible that the&nbsp;<strong>price may have moved</strong>&nbsp;and the price confirmed between the broker and the LP may have&nbsp;<strong>changed</strong>. If it has, this is the price that YOUR trade with your broker will be executed.</p>
    <p>This is what causes slippage.</p>
    <p>When an STP broker accepts a customer&rsquo;s &ldquo;order&rdquo;, the broker is considered to be &ldquo;working&rdquo; that order, which indicates a willingness to<strong>&nbsp;attempt, but not commit</strong>, to enter into the trade at the price requested by the customer.</p>
    <p>Here&rsquo;s a comparison of the different types of order execution:</p>

    <h2>Riskless Principal</h2>
    <p>When a trade is executed via STP, this type of transaction is known as a &ldquo;<strong>riskless principal</strong>&rdquo; or &ldquo;<strong>matched principal</strong>&rdquo; transaction.</p>
    <p>What is a &ldquo;principal&rdquo;?</p>
    <p>A &ldquo;<strong>principal</strong>&rdquo; is a party to a transaction. For example, the buyer and seller. It&rsquo;s basically a fancy word for &ldquo;<strong>counterparty</strong>&ldquo;.</p>
    <p>Remember, your forex broker is always taking the opposite of your trade. When you buy, it sells to you. And when you sell, it buys from you.</p>
    <p>It is the sole counterparty to all your trades.</p>
    <p>This is known as a &ldquo;<strong>principal</strong>&rdquo; transaction.</p>
    <p><img title="Counterparty-to-Counteparty Transaction" src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/05/04191732/counterparty-to-counterparty.png" sizes="(max-width: 581px) 100vw, 581px" srcset="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/05/04191732/counterparty-to-counterparty.png 581w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/05/04191732/counterparty-to-counterparty-360x82.png 360w" alt="Counterparty-to-Counteparty Transaction" width="581" height="133" /></p>
    <p>As you&rsquo;ve learned earlier, as your counterparty (principal), the forex broker exposes itself to market risk.</p>
    <p>But with STP execution, a &ldquo;riskless principal&rdquo; transaction is possible.</p>
    <p>When you place an order with an STP broker, it immediately attempts to place an identical order (a &ldquo;back-to-back order&rdquo;) with an external liquidity provider.</p>
    <p>Upon this&nbsp;<strong>&ldquo;back-to-back&rdquo; order</strong>&nbsp;being matched or filled in whole, the broker opens (or closes) the order on your account.</p>
    <p><img title="Back-to_back STP Trade Execution" src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/06/06150829/back-to-back-STP-forex-trade1.png" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" srcset="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/06/06150829/back-to-back-STP-forex-trade1.png 700w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/06/06150829/back-to-back-STP-forex-trade1-360x206.png 360w" alt="Back-to_back STP Trade Execution" width="700" height="400" /></p>
    <p>This is how it&rsquo;s able to act as a &ldquo;riskless principal&rdquo; to every trade opened or closed in your account.</p>
    <p>A broker acts as a riskless principal because once you submit your order:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>It first buys from an external liquidity provider for its own account (as principal), then</li>
    <li>Records that transaction in its own trading book, and then</li>
    <li>More or less immediately, sells to you (also as principal),</li>
    <li>Either at the same price (with a &ldquo;commission&rdquo;) or at a markup (with no commission).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As a result, there are TWO transactions:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>One between you and riskless principal (forex broker)</li>
    <li>One between the riskless principal (forex broker) and the &ldquo;market&rdquo; (third-party LP).</li>
    </ol>
    <p><a href="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/05/16182957/matched-principal1.png"><img title="Matched Principal Transaction" src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/05/16182957/matched-principal1-780x336.png" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" srcset="https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/05/16182957/matched-principal1-780x336.png 780w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/05/16182957/matched-principal1-768x331.png 768w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/05/16182957/matched-principal1-360x155.png 360w, https://bpcdn.co/images/2021/05/16182957/matched-principal1.png 1022w" alt="Matched Principal Transaction" width="780" height="336" /></a></p>
    <p>For example, a broker receives a customer&rsquo;s order to buy 100,000 units of GBP/USD at the prevailing market price of<strong>&nbsp;1.4000</strong>&nbsp;would immediately buy the 100,000 units from a third-party liquidity provider (LP).</p>
    <p>Since both trades were executed at the same price (excluding any previously disclosed markup, fees, or commission), this would qualify as a riskless principal transaction.</p>
    <p>As you can see, your trade with the broker and the broker&rsquo;s trade with the LP&nbsp;<em>matches</em>. Hence, the term &ldquo;<strong>matched principal</strong>&ldquo;.</p>
    <p>The concept of &ldquo;riskless principal&rdquo; and &ldquo;matched principal&rdquo; is important to know because it&rsquo;s the closest thing a forex &ldquo;broker&rdquo; can do to&nbsp;<strong>act like a true broker</strong>.</p>
    <p>They can &ldquo;act&rdquo; like a broker by being a riskless principal, but unlike a&nbsp;<strong>true broker or agent</strong>, who simply plays the role of a matchmaker by facilitating a transaction between&nbsp;<strong>two separate counterparties</strong>, a riskless principal is still your counterparty.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p><strong>Agency vs. Principal Trades:&nbsp;</strong>In an agency trade, you&rsquo;re acting as an agent for a client and DO NOT take part in the trade. You merely facilitate. This is what true&nbsp;<strong>brokers</strong>&nbsp;do. In a principal trade, you&rsquo;re acting as principal and DO take part in the trade. You are the seller to a buyer&hellip;.and the buyer to a seller. This is what&nbsp;<strong>dealers</strong>&nbsp;do.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>When you enter a market order on your broker&rsquo;s trading platform, it still takes the opposite side of your trade, but it acts as a&nbsp;<strong>riskless principal</strong>&nbsp;by simultaneously entering into&nbsp;<strong>offsetting trades</strong>&nbsp;with both you and an external liquidity provider.</p>
    <p>Your broker makes money by adding a markup to the price provided by the liquidity provider and/or charging you a commission. This means that it generates its trading revenues based on the&nbsp;<strong>volume of transactions, and not trading profits or losses.</strong></p>
    <p>It doesn&rsquo;t expose itself to market risk, which means it doesn&rsquo;t profit when you lose. The only money it makes when executing your order is from a&nbsp;<strong>previously disclosed price markup or commission</strong>.</p>
    <p>Brokers who operate this way are&nbsp;<strong>designated as &ldquo;riskless principal&rdquo; or &ldquo;matched principal&rdquo; brokers.&nbsp;</strong></p>
    <p>You can verify if your broker is one by looking at its registration listing on their regulatory agency&rsquo;s website.</p>
