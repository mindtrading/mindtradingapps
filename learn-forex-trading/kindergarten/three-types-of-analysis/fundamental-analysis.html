    <p>Whereas technical analysis involves poring over charts to identify patterns or trends, fundamental analysis involves poring over economic data reports and news headlines. (And even random tweets from a certain world leader before he was banned.)</p>
    <p>Fundamental analysis is a way of looking at the forex market by analyzing economic, social, and political forces that may&nbsp;<strong>affect currency prices.</strong></p>
    <p>If you think about it, this makes a whole lot of sense! Just like in your Economics 101 class, it is&nbsp;<strong>supply and demand that determines price</strong>, or in our case, the currency&nbsp;<strong>exchange rate</strong>.</p>
    <p>Using supply and demand as an indicator of where price could be headed is easy. The hard part is analyzing all of the&nbsp;<strong>factors that affect supply and demand</strong>.</p>
    <p>In other words, you have to look at different factors to determine whose economy is rockin&rsquo; like a BLACKPINK song, and whose economy sucks.</p>
    <p>You have to understand the reasons why and how certain events like an increase in the unemployment rate affect a country&rsquo;s economy and monetary policy which ultimately, affects the level of demand for its currency.</p>
    <p>The idea behind this type of analysis is that if a country&rsquo;s current or future economic outlook is good, its currency should strengthen.</p>
    <p>The better shape a country&rsquo;s economy is, the more foreign businesses and investors will invest in that country. This results in the need to purchase that country&rsquo;s currency to obtain those assets.</p>
    <p>In a nutshell, this is what&nbsp;<strong>fundamental analysis</strong>&nbsp;is:</p>
    <p><img title="Forex Fundamental Analysis" src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2011/03/fundamental-analysis.png"  /><br />For example, let&rsquo;s say that the U.S. dollar has been gaining strength because the U.S. economy is improving.</p>
    <p>As the economy gets better, raising interest rates may be needed to control growth and inflation.</p>
    <p><strong>Higher interest rates</strong>&nbsp;make dollar-denominated financial assets more attractive.</p>
    <p>In order to get their hands on these lovely assets, traders and investors have to buy some U.S. dollars first. This increases&nbsp;<em>demand</em>&nbsp;for the currency.</p>
    <p>As a result, the value of the U.S. dollar will likely increase&nbsp;<strong>against other currencies with lesser demand</strong>.&nbsp;Since currencies are always&nbsp;<strong>paired</strong>, their performance is determined relative to that of another currency.</p>
    <p>Later on in the course, you will learn which economic data points tend to drive currency prices, and why they do so.</p>
    <p>You will know who the Fed Chairman is and how retail sales data reflects the economy. You&rsquo;ll be spitting out global interest rates like song lyrics.</p>
    <p>To be able to use fundamental analysis, it is essential to understand how economic, financial, and political news will impact currency exchange rates.</p>
    <p>This requires a good understanding of&nbsp;<strong>macroeconomics and geopolitics</strong>.</p>
    <p>No need to be intimidated by such fancy-sounding words though. For now, just know that fundamental analysis is a way of analyzing the potential moves of a currency through the<strong>&nbsp;strength or weakness of that country&rsquo;s economic outlook</strong>. It&rsquo;s going to be awesome, we promise!</p>
