    <h2>Three Types of Market Analysis</h2>
    <p>To begin, let&rsquo;s look at three ways on how you would analyze and develop ideas to trade the market.</p>
    <p>There are&nbsp;<strong>three types of market analysis</strong>:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Technical Analysis</li>
    <li>Fundamental Analysis</li>
    <li>Sentiment Analysis</li>
    </ol>
    <p>There has always been a constant debate as to which analysis is better, but to tell you the truth, you need to know all three.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2011/03/16184517/types-of-market-analysis.png"  /></p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s kind of like standing on a&nbsp;<strong>three-legged stool.</strong></p>
    <p>If one of the legs is weak, the stool will break under your weight and you&rsquo;ll fall flat on your face.</p>
    <p>The same holds true in trading.</p>
    <p>Oh wait. Since the stool is supposed to represent how a trader goes about thinking and analyzing the market, it&rsquo;s missing a brain.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2011/03/16185442/types-of-market-analysis-brain.png"  /></p>
    <p>But wait! The stool needs more brains!</p>
    <p>There technically should be&nbsp;<em>three</em>&nbsp;brains&hellip;.to represent the three different types of thought process&hellip;</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2011/03/16185905/types-of-market-analysis-three-bsrain.png"  /></p>
    <p>Ahhh. There we go.</p>
    <p>You need to have three &ldquo;brains&rdquo; when thinking about the market.</p>
    <p>If your analysis on any of the&nbsp;<strong>three types of analysis i</strong>s weak and you ignore it, there&rsquo;s a good chance that it will cause you to lose out on your trade!</p>
