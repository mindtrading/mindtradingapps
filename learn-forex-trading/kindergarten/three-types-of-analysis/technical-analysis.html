    <p><strong>Technical analysis</strong>&nbsp;is the framework in which traders study price movement.</p>
    <p><strong>The theory is that a person can look at historical price movements and determine the current trading conditions and potential price movement.</strong></p>
    <p>Someone who uses technical analysis is called a&nbsp;<strong>technical analyst</strong>. Traders who use technical analysis are known as&nbsp;<strong>technical traders</strong>.</p>
    <p>The main evidence for using technical analysis is that, theoretically,&nbsp;<strong>all current market information is reflected in the price</strong>.</p>
    <p>Technical traders generally ascribe to the belief that &ldquo;<strong>It&rsquo;s all in the charts!</strong>&rdquo;</p>
    <p>This simply means that all known fundamental information is priced into the current market price.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2011/03/21205043/price-chart-360x360.png" alt="" />If price reflects all the information that is out there, then price action is all one would really need to make a trade.</p>
    <p>Technical analysis looks at the rhythm, flow, and trends in price action.</p>
    <p>Now, have you ever heard the old adage, &ldquo;<strong>History tends to repeat itself</strong>&ldquo;?</p>
    <p>Well, that&rsquo;s basically what technical analysis is&nbsp;all about!</p>
    <p>If a certain price held as a major support or resistance level in the past, forex traders will keep an eye out for it and base their trades around that historical price level.</p>
    <p>Technical analysts look for&nbsp;<strong>similar patterns</strong>&nbsp;that have formed in the past and will form trade ideas believing that price could&nbsp;<em>possibly</em>&nbsp;act the same way that it did before.</p>
    <p><strong>Technical analysis is NOT so much about prediction as it is about POSSIBILITY.&nbsp;</strong></p>
    <p>Technical analysis is the study of historical price action in order to identify patterns and determine<strong>&nbsp;possibilities of the future direction of price</strong>.</p>

    <h2>Technical analysis is the study of historical price action.</h2>
    <p>So how the heck does one &ldquo;<em>study historical price action</em>&ldquo;?</p>
    <p>In the world of trading, when someone says &ldquo;technical analysis&rdquo;, the first thing that comes to mind is a&nbsp;<strong>chart</strong>.</p>
    <p>Technical analysts use charts because they are the easiest way to&nbsp;<strong>visualize historical data</strong>!</p>
    <p>Technical analysts live, eat, and breathe charts which is why they are often called&nbsp;<strong>chartists</strong>.</p>
    <p>Chartists believe that price action is the most reliable indicator of future price action.</p>
    <p>You can look at past data to help you&nbsp;<strong>spot trends and patterns</strong>&nbsp;which could help you find some great trading opportunities.</p>
    <p>What&rsquo;s more is that with all the traders who rely on technical analysis out there, these price patterns and indicator signals tend to become self-fulfilling.</p>
    <p>As more and more forex traders look for certain price levels and chart patterns, the more likely that these patterns will manifest themselves in the markets.</p>
    <p>You should know though that&nbsp;<strong>technical analysis is VERY subjective.</strong></p>
    <p>Just because Michelangelo, Donatello, Leonardo, and Raphael are looking at the exact same chart setup or indicators doesn&rsquo;t mean that they will come up with the same idea of where price may be headed.</p>
    <p>The important thing is that you understand the concepts under technical analysis so you won&rsquo;t get nosebleeds whenever somebody starts talking about Fibonacci, Bollinger Bands, or pivot points.</p>
    <p>Now we know you&rsquo;re thinking to yourself, &ldquo;Geez, these guys are smart. They use crazy words like &lsquo;Fibonacci&rsquo; and &lsquo;Bollinger&rsquo;. I can never learn this stuff!&rdquo;</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/kindergarten-nosebleed.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>Don&rsquo;t worry yourself too much. After you&rsquo;re done with the School of Pipsology, you too will be just as&hellip; uhmmm&hellip; &ldquo;smart&rdquo; as us.</p>
