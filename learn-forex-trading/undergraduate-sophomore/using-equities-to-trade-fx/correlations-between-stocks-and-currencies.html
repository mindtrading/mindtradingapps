    <p>Let&rsquo;s see how the forex market&nbsp;can affect the stock market, specifically stock indexes.</p>
    <p>When people talk about the stock market, you generally hear them using a stock market index in reference to the market&rsquo;s performance.</p>
    <p>A stock market index is simply a&nbsp;<strong>curated basket of certain stocks</strong>. This list of stocks is a way to get a broad measure of what&rsquo;s happening in the stock market.</p>
    <p>In this lesson, we discuss how currencies can have an effect on two specific stock indexes:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>The&nbsp;<strong>Nikkei 225</strong>&nbsp;more commonly called the&nbsp;<strong>Nikkei</strong>, the Nikkei index, or the Nikkei Stock Average is a Japan stock market index that measures the stock performance of Japan&rsquo;s largest 225 companies listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE).</li>
    <li>The&nbsp;<strong>Dow Jones Industrial Average</strong>, Dow Jones, or simply the&nbsp;<strong>Dow</strong>, is a U.S. stock market index that measures the stock performance of 30 large American companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the NASDAQ.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Nikkei and USD/JPY</h2>
    <p>Before the global economic recession that started in 2007, when most economies suffered consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth, the Nikkei and the USD/JPY were&nbsp;<strong>inversely correlated</strong>.</p>
    <p>Investors believed that the performance of the Japanese stock market reflected the status of the country, so a rally in the Nikkei led to a strengthening of the yen.</p>
    <p>The opposite also held true. Whenever the Nikkei would drop, USD/JPY would rise as well.</p>

    <p>When the financial crisis hit, however, the relationships just went crazy like Lindsay Lohan.</p>
    <p>The Nikkei and USD/JPY, which used to move oppositely, now move in the same direction.</p>
    <p>Amazing isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
    <p>Who would&rsquo;ve thought that stocks would have something to do with the foreign exchange market?</p>
    <h2>Correlation Between USD/JPY and Dow</h2>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at the correlation between the USD/JPY and the Dow.</p>
    <p>Generally, the strength or weakness of the dollar, impacts the U.S. stock market, particularly stocks of large multi-national corporations (MNCs).</p>
    <p>For large U.S. multinationals that sell goods and services overseas, a rising U.S. dollar can put a crimp into the profits.</p>
    <p>If the dollar is strong, it makes a difference for those companies since it makes it difficult for them to increase prices or even maintain sales at current levels.</p>
    <p>That said, you might assume that the USD/JPY and Dow would be highly correlated.</p>
    <p>However, a look at the chart below would tell you that it isn&rsquo;t quite the case. While the correlation is positive, it isn&rsquo;t as strong.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/sophomore-dowvsusdjpy.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>Take a look at the Dow (blue line).</p>
    <p>It peaked at 14,000 late in 2007 before dropping like a hot potato in 2008.</p>
    <p>At the same time, USD/JPY (orange line) also fell, but not as sharply as the Dow.</p>
    <p>This serves&nbsp;as a reminder that we should always take into account fundamentals, technicals, and market sentiment, so always read up!</p>
    <p>Don&rsquo;t take correlations for granted because they aren&rsquo;t a sure-fire thing!</p>
