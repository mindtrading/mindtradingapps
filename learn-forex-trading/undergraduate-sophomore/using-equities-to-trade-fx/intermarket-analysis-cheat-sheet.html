    <p><strong>Intermarket analysis</strong>&nbsp;studies the&nbsp;<strong>relationships between asset classes</strong>, typically currencies, bonds, commodities, and stocks.</p>
    <p>It can help traders generate broader trading ideas, reveal potential market turning points, or confirm other analysis methods.</p>
    <p><strong>The price action of currencies is often driven by their relationship with commodities, bonds, and stock indices.</strong></p>
    <p>For example, here are some traditional intermarket relationships:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>A falling U.S. dollar is viewed as positive for commodities prices, while a&nbsp;rising U.S. dollar is considered negative for commodities price.</li>
    <li>Falling bond prices/rising interest rates tend to be negative for stocks while rising bond prices/falling interest rates are normally good for stocks,</li>
    <li>Rising commodities prices are historically a sign of economic growth which is good for the stock market and negative for bond prices.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Whew!</p>
    <p>That&rsquo;s a lot of intermarket correlations to remember! And that&rsquo;s just a couple of intermarket relationship examples.</p>
    <p>Here&rsquo;s a neat one-page cheat sheet for you to bookmark and make it easy for you!</p>
