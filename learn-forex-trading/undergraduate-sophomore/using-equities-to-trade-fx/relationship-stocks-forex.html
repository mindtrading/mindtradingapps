    <p>One issue with using global equity markets to make forex trading decisions is figuring out which leads which.</p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s like answering that age-old question, &ldquo;Which came first, the chicken or the egg?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s yo daddy?!&rdquo;</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/sophomore-chicken-or-egg.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>Are the equity markets calling the shots? Or is it the forex market that wears the pants in the relationship?</p>
    <p>The basic&nbsp;<em>theory</em>&nbsp;is that, when a domestic equity market rises,&nbsp;<strong>confidence in that specific country grows as well, leading to an inflow of funds from foreign investors.</strong></p>
    <p>This tends to create a&nbsp;<strong>demand</strong>&nbsp;for the domestic currency, causing it to rally against other foreign currencies.</p>
    <p>On the flip side, when a domestic equity market performs terribly, confidence falters, causing investors to convert their invested funds back into their own local currencies.</p>
    <p>Sounds great in theory, but in reality, it&rsquo;s&hellip;complicated.</p>
    <p>For example, the historical relationship between the U.S. dollar and the S&amp;P 500 hasn&rsquo;t been consistent.</p>
    <p>As shown below, over the last 20 years they have moved together, moved in opposite directions, and have been unrelated.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2010/10/dollar-equity-relationship.jpg" alt="" /></p>
    <p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean the relationship is useless.&nbsp;<strong>You just have to know when the correlation is working (whether negative or positive) and when it&rsquo;s not.</strong></p>
    <p>Here&rsquo;s an example where U.S. and Japan stocks moved in opposite directions of their currencies.</p>
    <p>Any upbeat economic figures in the U.S. and Japan more often than not weigh down on their respective currencies, the dollar and yen.</p>
    <p>First, let&rsquo;s take a look at the correlation between the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nikkei to see how stock markets all over the globe perform relative to each other.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/sophomore-dowvsnikkei_th.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>Since the turn of the century, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nikkei 225, the Japanese stock index, have been moving together like lovers on Valentine&rsquo;s Day, falling and rising at the same time.</p>
    <p>Also notice that sometimes one index leads, rallying or dropping first before being followed by the other index.</p>
    <p>It doesn&rsquo;t happen every single time, but you could say that stock markets in the world generally move in the same direction.</p>
