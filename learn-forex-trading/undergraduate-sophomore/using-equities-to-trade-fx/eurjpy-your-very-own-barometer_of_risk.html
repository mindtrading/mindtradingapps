    <p>As we said earlier, in order for someone to invest in a particular stock market, one would need the local currency in order to purchase stocks.</p>
    <p>You can imagine the effect that stock markets like the DAX (that&rsquo;s the German stock market), have on currencies.</p>
    <p>In theory, whenever the DAX rises, we can probably expect the euro to rise as well, as investors need to get a hand on some euros.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/sophomore-sick-global-economy.png" alt="" />While the correlation is imperfect, statistics show that it still holds pretty accurately.</p>
    <p>We here at BabyPips.com did a little research of our own and found out that&nbsp;<strong>EUR/JPY seems to be highly correlated with stock markets across the globe</strong>.</p>
    <p>You should know that the yen, along with the U.S. dollar, is considered to be safe havens amongst the major currencies.</p>
    <p>Whenever confidence in the global economy is down and traders are fearful, we typically see traders take their money out of the stock markets, which leads to a drop in the values of the DAX and S&amp;P500.</p>
    <p><strong>With money flowing out of these markets, we usually see EUR/JPY fall as traders run for cover.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>On the flip side, when the sun is bright and risk appetite is rampant, investors pour their money into stock markets, which in turn leads to a rise in the EUR/JPY.</strong></p>
    <p>Take a look at the charts below to see the correlation between the EUR/JPY and the DAX and S&amp;P500.</p>

    <p>The correlation seems to have held well this past decade, as EUR/JPY and both indexes rose steadily together, until 2008 when we were hit with the&nbsp;Grear Financial Crisis (GFC).</p>
    <p>In late 2007, EUR/JPY had hit its peak, and so did the stock indexes.</p>
