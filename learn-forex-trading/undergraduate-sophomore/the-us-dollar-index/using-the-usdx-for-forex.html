    <p>I bet you&rsquo;re wondering, &ldquo;How do I use this USDX in my forex trading&nbsp;arsenal?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Well, hold your trigger finger and you&rsquo;ll soon find out! We all know that most of the widely traded currency pairs include the U.S. dollar.</p>
    <p>If you don&rsquo;t know, some that include the U.S. dollar are EUR/USD, GBP/USD, USD/CHF, USD/JPY, and USD/CAD.</p>
    <p>What does this mean? If you trade any of these pairs, the USDX can be the next best thing to sliced bread (or hamburger on a bun&hellip; or chocolate ice cream).</p>
    <p>If you don&rsquo;t, the USDX will still give you an idea of the relative strength of the U.S. dollar around the world.</p>
    <p>In fact, when the market outlook for the U.S. dollar is unclear, more often times than not, the USDX provides a better picture.</p>
    <p><strong>In the wide world of forex, the USDX can be used as an indicator of the U.S. dollar&rsquo;s strength.</strong></p>
    <p>Because the USDX is comprised of more than 50% by the eurozone, EUR/USD is quite inversely related. Check it:</p>

    <p>Next, take a look at a chart of EUR/USD.</p>
    <p><img title="EUR/USD Daily Chart" src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/sophomore-eurusd-daily.png" /></p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s like a mirror image! If one goes up, the other most likely goes down.</p>
    <p>Will you look at that? It seems like the trend lines almost inversely match up perfectly. This could be a big help to those big on trading EUR/USD.</p>
    <p>Some of our forex trading&nbsp;friends in the forums monitor the USDX as an indicator for EUR/USD. Hang out with them if you wanna learn more about using this index.</p>
    <p>If the USDX makes significant movements, you can almost surely expect currency traders to react to the movement accordingly.</p>
    <p><strong>Both the USDX and forex&nbsp;traders react to each other. Breakouts in spot USD pairs will almost certainly move the USDX in a similar breakout fashion.</strong></p>
    <p>To sum it all up, forex&nbsp;traders use the USDX as a&nbsp;<strong>key indicator for the direction of the USD</strong>.</p>
    <p>Always keep in mind the position of the USD in the pair you are trading.</p>
    <p>For example, if the USDX is strengthening and rising, and you are trading EUR/USD, a strong USD will show a downtrend on the EUR/USD chart.</p>
    <p>If you are trading a pair in which the USD is the based currency, such as the USD/CHF, a rise in the USDX will most likely show a rise in USD/CHF charts like the one shown below.</p>

    <p>Here are two little tips you should always remember:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>If USD is the base currency (USD/XXX), then the USDX and the currency pair should move in the&nbsp;<strong>same</strong>&nbsp;direction.</li>
    <li>If USD is the quote currency (XXX/USD), then the USDX and the currency pair should move in&nbsp;<strong>opposite</strong>&nbsp;directions.</li>
    </ol>
