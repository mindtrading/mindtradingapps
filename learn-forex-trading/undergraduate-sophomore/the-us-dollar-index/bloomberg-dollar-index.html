    <p>The&nbsp;<strong>Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index</strong>&nbsp;(BBDXY) tracks the performance of a basket of 10 global currencies against the U.S. dollar.</p>
    <p>Its composition is updated annually and represents a diverse set of currencies that are important from a global trade and liquidity perspective.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2020/04/21161852/bloomberg-dollar-index-chart-780x439.jpg"  /></p>
    <p>Since other dollar indices (ahem&hellip;DXY) do not update their composition and are comprised of only a handful of currencies with concentrated weights,&nbsp;Bloomberg claims their index provides a better measure of the U.S. dollar.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2020/04/21144910/BBDXY-vs-DXY-780x451.png" /></p>
    <p>The BBDXY Index data starts from Dec 31, 2004, with a base level of 1000.</p>
    <p>Each currency in the basket and its weight is determined annually based on its&nbsp;<strong>share of international trade</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>FX liquidity</strong>.</p>

    <h2>A Better Measure of the U.S. Dollar?</h2>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s see how the&nbsp;<strong>Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index (BBDXY)</strong>&nbsp;differs from the widely used&nbsp;<strong>ICE Dollar Index (DXY)</strong>.</p>
    <h3>BBDXY is more representative.</h3>
    <p>The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index tracks a more representative basket of currencies by considering&nbsp;<strong>global currency market liquidity and trading partners of the U.S</strong>.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2020/04/21145252/bloomberg-dollar-spot-index-composition-780x439.png"  /></p>
    <h3>BBDXY is more diversified.</h3>
    <p>Unlike DXY, the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index is&nbsp;<strong>NOT dominated by the euro.</strong></p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2020/04/21155923/ICE-US-Dollar-Index1.png"  /></p>
    <p>It also&nbsp;<strong>includes major emerging market currencies</strong>&nbsp;such as the Indian rupee, Korean won, Mexican peso, and Chinese renminbi which are all major trading partners of the U.S.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2020/04/21195947/Bloomberg-Dollar-Spot-Index-Pie2.png" /></p>
    <h3>BBDXY is more dynamic.</h3>
    <p>Unlike the DXY&rsquo;s static composition, BBDXY is dynamic, with an&nbsp;<strong>annual rebalancing process</strong>&nbsp;that captures the changing state of currency markets.</p>
    <p>This results in the index that includes important currencies (like the Australian dollar) that&nbsp;<strong>rank higher in liquidity and trading</strong>&nbsp;versus the Swedish krona.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p><strong>Why does USDX include Sweden?&nbsp;</strong>Because the index still livin&rsquo; in the past!&nbsp;The ICE U.S. Dollar Index measures the value of the U.S. Dollar against a basket of currencies of the top six trading partners of the United States,&nbsp;<strong>as measured in 1973!&nbsp;</strong>This included the&nbsp;Euro zone, Japan, the United Kingdom, Canada, Sweden, and Switzerland.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Here&rsquo;s a snapshot of how the Bloomberg Dollar Index has rebalanced over the years.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2020/04/21152654/Bloomberg-Dollar-Spot-Index-historical-rebalancing-780x439.png" /></p>
    <p>Notice how currencies like the Singaporean dollar (SGD) and Brazilian real (BRL) used to be part of the cool club but eventually got the boot and were replaced.</p>
    <p>BBDXY don&rsquo;t play around. It likes to keep it fresh!</p>
    <p>This is in contrast to the U.S. Dollar Index (USDX, DXY, DX) where the currencies never change. Maybe they should call themselves the &ldquo;Boring Dollar Index&rdquo;.&nbsp;ðŸ˜‚</p>
    <h2>Which Currencies Are Part of the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index?</h2>
    <p>Here is the most recent composition of the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index compared to the previous year.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2020/04/21152815/2020-Bloomberg-Dollar-Spot-Index-Composition-780x439.png" /></p>
    <h2>How the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index Determines Which Currencies to Include</h2>
    <p>The index rebalances once a year to incorporate new data from:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>The annual survey of&nbsp;<strong>major trading partners</strong>&nbsp;versus the U.S. dollar as&nbsp;reported by the Federal Reserve.</li>
    <li>The triennial survey of&nbsp;<strong>most liquid currencies</strong>&nbsp;as reported by the Bank of International&nbsp;Settlements (BIS).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Currencies pegged to the U.S. dollar are excluded and currencies heavily managed (like the Chinese renminbi) have their exposure capped.</p>
    <p>To ensure&nbsp;tradability, currencies with weights of less than 2% are removed.</p>
    <p>At each annual rebalance, the following steps are taken to select which currencies to include and their weights:</p>
    <ol>
    <li><strong>Identify the top 20 currencies in terms of trading activity versus the underlying currency.</strong>&nbsp;For the U.S. dollar, this is as defined by the Federal Reserve in its Broad Index of the Foreign Exchange Value of the Dollar.</li>
    <li><strong>Identify the top 20 currencies from the Triennial Central</strong><strong>Bank Survey of Foreign Exchange and Derivatives&nbsp;</strong><strong>Market Activity.&nbsp;</strong>Specific information about foreign</li>
    <li><strong>Select the top 10 currencies of both lists, but exclude any pegged currencies.</strong>&nbsp;For example, currencies pegged to the U.S.&nbsp;dollar (such as the Hong Kong dollar or Saudi riyal) are&nbsp;removed for the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index.</li>
    <li><strong>Assign a preliminary weight for each currency based on its trade weight and liquidity weight.&nbsp;</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Cap the exposure of Chinese renminbi and remove&nbsp;smaller currency positions,</strong>&nbsp;defined as&nbsp;any position that has a weight of less than 2%.</li>
    <li>Voila! BBDXY calculation complete!</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The rebalanced target weights are applied after the close of the&nbsp;<strong>last U.S trading day in&nbsp;December&nbsp;</strong>every year.</p>
    <p>Here&rsquo;s a chart that visualizes the above process:</p>
