    <p>Just like any currency pair, the&nbsp;<strong>US Dollar Index (USDX)</strong>&nbsp;even has its own chart.</p>
    <p>Holler at the U.S. Dollar Index:</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/sophomore-usdxchart.png"  /></p>
    <p>First, notice that the index is calculated 24 hours a day, five days a week.</p>
    <p>Also, the US Dollar Index (USDX) measures the dollar&rsquo;s general value relative to a base of 100.000. Huh?!?</p>
    <p>Okay. For example, the current reading says 86.212.</p>
    <p>This means that the dollar has fallen 13.79% since the start of the index. (86.212 &ndash; 100.000).</p>
    <p>If the reading was 120.650, it means the dollar&rsquo;s value has risen 20.65% since the start of the index. (120.650 &ndash; 100.00)</p>
    <p>The start of the US Dollar Index is March 1973. This is when the world&rsquo;s biggest nations met in Washington D.C. and all agreed to allow their currencies to float freely against each other.</p>
    <p>The start of the index is also known as the &ldquo;<strong>base period</strong>&ldquo;.</p>
    <h2>The U.S. Dollar Index Formula</h2>
    <p>This is strictly for the grown and geeky. Here is the formula for calculating USDX:</p>
    <p>USDX = 50.14348112 &times; EUR/USD^(-0.576) &times; USD/JPY^(0.136) &times; GBP/USD^(-0.119) &times; USD/CAD^(0.091) &times; USD/SEK^(0.042) &times; USD/CHF^(0.036)</p>
    <p>Got that? Good! Now you can get a wedgie from the school bully.</p>
    <p>We&rsquo;re kidding!</p>
