    <p>There is also another kind of U.S. dollar index.</p>
    <p>It was created by the Federal Reserve&nbsp;and is now used widely by lots of sexy people, like economists and currency analysts.</p>
    <p>It is called the &ldquo;<strong>Trade Weighted U.S. Dollar Index</strong>&ldquo;.</p>
    <p>Their website is probably one of the most beautiful websites ever made&hellip;</p>

    <p>Just kidding. It&rsquo;s a government website.</p>
    <p>Beautiful? Like lipstick on a pig.</p>

    <p>Useful? Hell yeah.&nbsp;üëç</p>
    <p>The trade-weighted US dollar index, also known as the&nbsp;<strong>broad index</strong>, is a measure of the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other foreign currencies.</p>
    <p>It is a trade-weighted index that tries to improve on the older AND privately-owned ICE U.S. Dollar Index&nbsp;(USDX) by using more currencies and updating the weights yearly.</p>
    <p>The Fed wanted to create an index that could more accurately reflect the dollar&rsquo;s value against foreign currencies based on how competitive U.S. goods are compared to goods from other countries.</p>
    <p>It was formed in 1998 in order to keep up-to-date with U.S. trade.</p>

    <h2>The Trade-Weighted U.S. Dollar Index</h2>
    <p><strong>The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis</strong>&nbsp;provides &ldquo;weighted averages of the foreign exchange value of the U.S. dollar against the currencies of a broad group of major U.S. trading partners.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>From strongest to weakest, here is the current weighting (in percentage) of the index:</p>

    <p><em>*Weights as of&nbsp;December 16, 2019</em></p>
    <p>The main difference between the USDX and the trade-weighted U.S. dollar index is the&nbsp;<strong>basket of currencies used and their relative weights</strong>.</p>
    <p>The trade-weighted index includes countries from all over the world, including some developing countries.</p>
    <p>Given how global trade is developing, this index is probably a better reflection of the U.S. dollar&rsquo;s value across the globe.</p>
    <p>The weights are based on&nbsp;<strong>annual trade data.</strong></p>
