   <p>Today we&rsquo;re going to take a trip around the world, but it ain&rsquo;t gonna take 80 days.</p>
   <p>If you&rsquo;re fast enough to keep up, we can probably get around in just 80 seconds!</p>
   <p>&hellip;Not!</p>
   <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/sophomore-globetrotter.png" alt="" />In any case, we&rsquo;ll make sure you learn about the nitty-gritty of each major economy and what makes its engine go.</p>
   <p>For each country that we will be touring, we&rsquo;ll start off with a quick peek at the important&nbsp;<strong>facts and figures</strong>, followed by an&nbsp;<strong>overview of its economy</strong>.</p>
   <p>Once that&rsquo;s out of the way, we&rsquo;ll visit the&nbsp;<strong>country&rsquo;s central bank</strong>&nbsp;to find out some of their secrets.</p>
   <p>In this section, we will explore the powerful&nbsp;<strong>monetary policy tools</strong>&nbsp;that central banks use to try and &ldquo;manage&rdquo; a country&rsquo;s economy.</p>
   <p>Hopefully, we&rsquo;ll stumble into the room where they keep their printing plates and we can sneak out the back door and sell it on the black market.</p>
   <p>We&rsquo;re kidding. We&rsquo;re here to teach you how to trade currencies the legal way.&nbsp;</p>
   <p>After that, we&rsquo;ll discuss the&nbsp;<strong>important characteristics</strong>&nbsp;that differentiate that country&rsquo;s local currency from all the rest, as well as hard-hitting&nbsp;<strong>economic indicators</strong>&nbsp;for that country.</p>
   <p>To keep the trip interesting, we&rsquo;ll be dishing some&nbsp;<strong>trivia</strong>&nbsp;every now and&nbsp;<strong>trading tactics</strong>&nbsp;that will prove useful later on when you go off on your pip-catching adventure!</p>
   <p>And as we promised, this very exclusive field trip is covered by your scholarship.</p>
   <p>No need for travel visas and no need to buy a travel fanny.</p>
   <p>Pack light, cause all you&rsquo;ll need is your hunger for more learning.</p>
   <p>Are you ready?</p>
   <p>Let&rsquo;s get this show on the road!</p>
