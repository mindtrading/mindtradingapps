    <p>Before we detail the relationship between the comdolls and gold, let&rsquo;s first note that the U.S. dollar and gold don&rsquo;t quite mesh very well.</p>
    <p>Usually, when the dollar moves up, the gold falls and vice-versa.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/sophomore-gold-digger.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>The traditional logic here is that during times of economic unrest, investors tend to dump the greenback in favor of gold.</p>
    <p>Unlike other assets, gold maintains its intrinsic value or rather, its natural shine!</p>
    <h2>Gold and AUD/USD</h2>
    <p>Nowadays, the inverse relationship between the Greenback and gold still remains although the dynamics behind it have somewhat changed.</p>
    <p>Because of the dollar&rsquo;s safe-haven appeal, whenever there is economic trouble in the U.S. or across the globe, investors more often than not run back to the Greenback.</p>
    <p>The reverse happens when there are signs of growth.</p>
    <p>Take a look at this awesome chart:</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/sophomore-gold-vs-audusd-2011.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>Currently, Australia is the third biggest gold-digger&hellip; we mean, gold producer in the world, sailing out about $5 billion worth of the yellow treasure every year!</p>
    <p>Gold has a&nbsp;<strong>positive correlation</strong>&nbsp;with AUD/USD.</p>
    <p>When gold goes up, AUD/USD tends to go up. When gold goes down, AUD/USD tends to go down.</p>
    <p>Historically, AUD/USD has had a whopping 80% correlation to the price of gold!</p>
    <p>Not convinced? Here&rsquo;s another one:</p>
    <h2>Gold and USD/CHF</h2>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/sophomore-gold-vs-usdchf-2011.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>Across the seven seas, Switzerland&rsquo;s currency, the Swiss franc, also has a strong link with gold. Using the dollar as base currency, the USD/CHF usually climbs when the price of gold slides.</p>
    <p>Conversely, the pair dips when the price of gold goes up.</p>
    <p>Unlike the Australian dollar, the reason why the Swiss franc moves along with gold is that more than 25% of Switzerland&rsquo;s money is backed by gold reserves.</p>
    <p>Gold has a&nbsp;<strong>negative&nbsp;correlation</strong>&nbsp;with USD/CHF.</p>
    <p>When gold goes up, USD/CHF&nbsp;goes down.&nbsp;When gold goes down,&nbsp;USD/CHF&nbsp;goes&nbsp;up.</p>
    <p>Isn&rsquo;t that awesome?</p>
    <p>Keep in mind that that this correlation is not set in stone and may change in the future.</p>
    <p>The relationship between gold and major currencies is just ONE of the many that we will tackle. Keep reading!</p>
