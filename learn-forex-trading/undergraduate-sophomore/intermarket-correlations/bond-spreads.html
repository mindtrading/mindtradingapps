    <p>The&nbsp;<strong>bond spread</strong>&nbsp;represents the difference between two countries&rsquo; bond yields.</p>
    <p>These differences give rise to carry trade, which we discussed in a previous lesson.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/sophomore-bond-spread.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>By monitoring bond spreads and expectations for interest rate changes, you will have&nbsp;an idea of where currency pairs are headed.</p>
    <p>Here&rsquo;s what we mean:</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/sophomore-bondspreadvsaudusd.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p><strong>As the bond spread between two economies&nbsp;<em>widens</em>, the currency of the country with the higher bond yield&nbsp;<em>appreciates</em>&nbsp;against the other currency of the country with the lower bond yield.</strong></p>
    <p>You can observe this phenomenon by looking at the graph of AUD/USD price action and the bond spread between Australian and U.S. 10-year government bonds from January 2000 to January 2012.</p>
    <p>Notice that when the bond spread rose from 0.50% to 1.00% from 2002 to 2004, AUD/USD rose almost 50%, rising from .5000 to 0.7000.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The same happened in 2007, when the bond differential rose from 1.00% to 2.50%, AUD/USD rose from .7000 to just above .9000.</p>
    <p>That&rsquo;s 2,000 pips!</p>
    <p>Once the recession of 2008 came along and all the major central banks started to cut their interest rates, AUD/USD plunged from the .9000 handle back down to 0.7000.</p>
    <p>So what happened here?</p>
    <p>One factor that is probably in play here is that traders are taking advantage of carry trades.</p>
    <p><strong>When bond spreads were&nbsp;<em>increasing</em>&nbsp;between the Aussie bonds and U.S. Treasuries, traders load up on their long AUD/USD positions.</strong></p>
    <p>Why?</p>
    <p>To take advantage of carry trade!</p>
    <p>However, once the Reserve Bank of Australia&nbsp;started cutting rates and bond spreads began to tighten, traders reacted by unwinding their long AUD/USD positions, as they were no longer as profitable.</p>
    <p>Here&rsquo;s one more example:</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2010/10/gbpusd-uk-us-bond-spread.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>As the&nbsp;bond spread between the UK bond and the US bond&nbsp;<em>decreased</em>, the GBP/USD&nbsp;<em>weakened</em>&nbsp;as well.</p>
