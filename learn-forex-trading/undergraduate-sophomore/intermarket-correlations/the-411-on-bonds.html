    <p>A&nbsp;<strong>bond</strong>&nbsp;is an &ldquo;IOU&rdquo; issued by an entity when it needs to borrow money.</p>
    <p>These entities, such as governments, municipalities, or multinational companies, need a lot of funds in order to operate so they often need to borrow from banks or individuals like you.</p>
    <p>When you own a government bond, in effect, the government has borrowed money from you.</p>
    <p>You might be wondering, &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that the same as owning stocks?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>One major difference is that bonds typically have a defined term to maturity, wherein the owner gets paid back the money he loaned, known as the&nbsp;<strong>principal</strong>, at a predetermined set date.</p>
    <p>Also, when an investor purchases a bond from a company, he gets paid at a specified rate of return, also known as the&nbsp;<strong>bond yield</strong>, at certain time intervals.</p>
    <p>These periodical interest payments are commonly known as&nbsp;<strong>coupon payments</strong>.</p>
    <p><strong>Bond yield</strong>&nbsp;refers to the rate of return or interest paid to the bondholder while the bond price is the amount of money the bondholder pays for the bond.</p>
    <p>Now, bond prices and bond yields are&nbsp;<em>inversely correlated</em>. When bond prices rise, bond yields fall and vice-versa.</p>
    <p>Here&rsquo;s a simple illustration to help you remember:</p>

    <p>Wait a minute&hellip; What does this have to do with the currency market?!!</p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s ignore that question for now.</p>
    <p>Always keep in mind that&nbsp;<strong>inter-market relationships</strong>&nbsp;govern currency price action.</p>
    <p><strong>Bond yields actually serve as an excellent indicator of the strength of a nation&rsquo;s&nbsp;stock market, which increases the demand for the nation&rsquo;s currency.</strong></p>
    <p>For example, U.S. bond yields gauge the performance of the U.S. stock market, thereby reflecting the demand for the U.S. dollar.</p>
    <p><strong>Let&rsquo;s look at one scenario:</strong>&nbsp;Demand for bonds usually increases when investors are concerned about the safety of their stock investments.</p>
    <p>This flight to safety drives bond prices higher and, by virtue of their inverse relationship, pushes bond yields down.</p>
    <p>As more and more investors move away from stocks and other high-risk investments, increased demand for &ldquo;less-risky instruments&rdquo; such as U.S. bonds and the safe-haven U.S. dollar pushes their prices higher.</p>
    <p><strong>Government bond yields act as an indicator of the overall direction of the country&rsquo;s interest rates and expectations</strong>.</p>
    <p>For example, in the U.S., you would focus on the 10-year Treasury note.</p>
    <p><strong>A rising yield is dollar bullish. A falling yield is dollar bearish.</strong></p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s important to know the&nbsp;<strong>underlying dynamic</strong>&nbsp;of why a bond&rsquo;s yield is rising or falling.</p>
    <p>It can be based on&nbsp;<strong>interest rate expectations</strong>&nbsp;OR it can be based on market uncertainty and a &ldquo;<strong>flight to safety</strong>&rdquo;&nbsp;with capital flowing from risky assets like stocks to less risky assets like bonds.</p>
    <p>After understanding how rising bond yields usually cause a nation&rsquo;s currency to appreciate, you&rsquo;re probably itching to find out how this can be applied to forex trading. Patience, young padawan!</p>
    <p>Recall that one of our goals in&nbsp;forex trading&nbsp;(aside from catching plenty of&nbsp;pips!), is to pair up a strong currency with a weak one by first comparing their respective economies.</p>
