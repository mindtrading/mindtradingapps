    <p>Let&rsquo;s talk about the other kind of gold&hellip; the black one.</p>
    <p>As you may know, crude oil is often referred to as the &ldquo;black gold&rdquo; or as we here at BabyPips.com like to call it, &ldquo;black crack.&rdquo;</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/sophomore-oil-drum.png" alt="" />One can live without gold, but if you&rsquo;re a crack addict, you can&rsquo;t live without crack.</p>
    <p>Oil is the drug that runs through the veins of the global economy as it is a major source of energy.</p>
    <p>Canada, one of the top oil producers in the world, exports over 3 million barrels of oil and petroleum products per day&nbsp;to the United States.</p>
    <p>This makes it the largest supplier of oil to the U.S.!</p>
    <p>This means that Canada is United States&rsquo; main black crack dealer!</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2010/10/us-oil-imports-by-country.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>Because of the volume involved, it creates a huge amount of demand for Canadian dollars.</p>
    <p>Also, take note that Canada&rsquo;s economy is dependent on exports, with about 85% of its exports going to its big brother down south, the U.S.</p>
    <p>Because of this, USD/CAD can be greatly affected by how U.S. consumers react to changes in oil prices.</p>
    <p>If U.S. demand rises, manufacturers will need to order more oil to keep up with demand. This can lead to a rise in oil prices, which might lead to a fall in USD/CAD.</p>
    <p>If U.S. demand falls, manufacturers may decide&nbsp;to chill out since they don&rsquo;t need to make more goods. Demand for oil might fall, which could hurt demand for the CAD.</p>
    <p>Oil&nbsp;has a&nbsp;<strong>negative&nbsp;correlation</strong>&nbsp;with USD/CAD of about 93% between 2000 through 2016.</p>
    <p>When oil&nbsp;goes up, USD/CAD goes down. When oil goes down, USD/CAD goes up.</p>
    <p>And to make the correlation clearer, we can invert USD/CAD to show how both markets move pretty much at the same time (i.e., crude oil will gain value with the Canadian dollar while the U.S. dollar falls&hellip;and vice versa. Check it out in the chart below:</p>

    <p>So, the next time you gas up your car and see that oil prices are rising, you can use this information to your advantage! It may be a clue for you to go short on USD/CAD!</p>
    <p>Some forex brokers allow you to trade gold, oil, and other commodities. There, you can readily pull up their charts using their platforms.</p>
    <p>You can also monitor the prices of gold on Yahoo! Finance. You can likewise check the prices of oil on Bloomberg as well.</p>
