    <p>As forex traders, it&rsquo;s important to pay attention to major economic data releases, speeches from government officials, and geopolitical events.</p>
    <p>Why?</p>
    <p>Because this information usually reflects the&nbsp;strength of a given economy and may indicate the future direction of a given currency.</p>
    <p>Trading the news is often difficult and not be suitable for everyone, but the volatility that follows can create lots of trading opportunities.</p>
    <h2>Why trade the news?</h2>
    <p>The simple answer to that question is &ldquo;To make more money!&rdquo;</p>
    <p>But in all seriousness, as we learned in the previous lesson, the news is a very important part of the forex market because&nbsp;<strong>news has the potential to make the market move!</strong></p>
    <h2><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2010/11/02211951/forex-news-trading.png" /></h2>
    <p>When news comes out, especially important news that everyone is watching, you can almost expect to see some major movement.</p>
    <p>The fact that you know the market will most likely move&nbsp;<em>somewhere</em>&nbsp;makes it an opportunity definitely worth looking at.</p>
    <p><strong>Your goal then, as a news trader, is to get on the correct side of the move.</strong></p>
    <h2>The Dangers of Trading the News</h2>
    <p>As with any trading strategy, there are always possible dangers that you should be aware of.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2010/11/05161955/trading-slippage.png" /></p>
    <p>Here are some of those dangers:</p>
    <h3>Spreads Widen</h3>
    <p>Because the forex market is very volatile during important news events,&nbsp;<strong>many forex brokers WIDEN the spread during these times</strong>.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2010/11/13124509/Wide-Broker-Spread.png" /></p>
    <p>This increases trading costs and could hurt your bottom line.</p>
    <p>You could also get &ldquo;locked out&rdquo; which means that your trade could be executed at the right time but may not show up on your trading platform for a few minutes.</p>
    <p>This is bad for you because you won&rsquo;t be able to make any adjustments if the trade moves against you!</p>
    <p>Imagine thinking you didn&rsquo;t get triggered, so you try to enter at the market price&hellip;&nbsp;<strong>only to realize that your original order got triggered</strong>!</p>

    <p>You&rsquo;d be risking TWICE as much now!</p>
    <h3>Price Slippage</h3>
    <p>You could also experience&nbsp;<strong>SLIPPAGE</strong>.</p>
    <p>Slippage occurs when you wish to enter the market at a certain price, but due to the extreme volatility during these events, you actually get filled at a far DIFFERENT price.</p>

    <p>Big market moves made by news events often don&rsquo;t move in one direction.</p>
    <p>Often times the market may start off flying in one direction, only to be&nbsp;<strong>whipsawed back in the other direction</strong>.</p>
    <p>Trying to find the right direction can sometimes be a headache!</p>
    <p>Profitable as it may be, trading the news isn&rsquo;t as easy as beating some toddler at&nbsp;Fornite. It will take tons of practice, practice and you guessed it&hellip; more practice!</p>
    <p>Most importantly, you must&nbsp;<strong>ALWAYS</strong>&nbsp;have a plan in place.</p>
    <p>In the following lessons, we&rsquo;ll give you some tips on how to safely trade the news.</p>
