    <p>Before developing a &lsquo;Trade the News&rdquo; strategy, we have to look at&nbsp;<strong>which news events are even worth trading</strong>.</p>
    <p>You want to be able to answer, &ldquo;<em>Which news releases should I trade?</em>&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Forex traders should&nbsp;familiarize themselves with the&nbsp;<strong>key event risks that heavily impact the major currencies</strong>.</p>
    <p>Remember that we are trading the news because of its ability to&nbsp;<strong>increase volatility in the short term</strong>, so naturally, we would like to only trade news that has the&nbsp;<strong>best market-moving potential for the currency market</strong>.</p>
    <p>The news that tends to drive price action and produce volatility usually involves:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Changes in&nbsp;<strong>central bank policy</strong>&nbsp;(&ldquo;monetary policy&rdquo;)</li>
    <li>Shifts in&nbsp;<strong>government policy&nbsp;</strong>(&ldquo;fiscal policy<strong>&ldquo;)</strong></li>
    <li>Unexpected results in<strong>&nbsp;economic data releases</strong></li>
    <li>Random&nbsp;<strong>tweets</strong>&nbsp;from a certain world leader who likes to put his name on tall buildings</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Being aware of upcoming key event risks can help avoid&nbsp;<strong>being on the wrong side of the market</strong>.</p>
    <h2>How to Find Events that Produce Volatility</h2>
    <p>The BabyPips.com Economic Calendar&nbsp;highlights the important events and economic data that are being released by the countries with the most popularly traded currencies.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2010/11/26134344/babypips-economic-calendar-780x587.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>The number of events scheduled can reach over a hundred on any given week! Trying to sift through so many events can be a pain in the butt.</p>
    <p>Luckily for you, our&nbsp;<strong>Economic Calendar</strong>&nbsp;makes it easy to identify the relative importance of each specific event.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2010/11/26134627/babypips-economic-calendar-filter-by-impact-780x587.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>In our Economic Calendar, you have the ability to filter event listings by &ldquo;<strong>Impact</strong>&ldquo;.</p>
    <p>For example, by selecting only &ldquo;<strong>HIGH</strong>&ldquo;, the Economic Calendar will only display the events that have historically been known to produce market volatility.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>If you spend some time exploring the Economic Calendar, you&rsquo;ll start to notice that the most important events usually relate to changes in interest rates, inflation, and economic growth, like retail sales, manufacturing, and consumer sentiment.</p>
    <p>Here are some examples:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Interest rate decisions</strong>&nbsp;by central banks</li>
    <li><strong>Inflation</strong>&nbsp;(CPI, PCE, PPI)</li>
    <li><strong>Employment data</strong>&nbsp;(unemployment, wage growth)</li>
    <li><strong>Economic growth</strong>&nbsp;(GDP)</li>
    <li><strong>Retail sales&nbsp;</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Industrial production</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Business sentiment</strong>&nbsp;surveys</li>
    <li><strong>Manufacturing sector</strong>&nbsp;surveys</li>
    <li><strong>Consumer confidence</strong>&nbsp;surveys</li>
    <li><strong>Housing data</strong>&nbsp;(sales, construction)</li>
    <li><strong>Trade balance</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Different countries may use different names for similar data but we try to point that out in the Economic Calendar.</p>
    <p><strong>Depending on what&rsquo;s currently happening in the world, the relative importance of this event may change.&nbsp;</strong></p>
    <p>For example, interest rate decisions may be the main focus during a certain time, while during a different time, it will seem like nobody cares.</p>
    <p><strong>This is why it&rsquo;s important to stay informed and know what the market is focusing on at the moment.</strong></p>
    <h2>Pay Special Attention to News from the U.S.</h2>
    <p>While the markets react to most economic news from various countries, the biggest movers and most watched news come from the&nbsp;<strong>U.S</strong>.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2010/11/breaking-news.jpeg" alt="" /></p>
    <p>The United States is still considered the world&rsquo;s most powerful country, whether it&rsquo;s in the domain of military affairs, geopolitics, industry, energy, science, culture, and technology.</p>
    <p>It is even described as a &ldquo;financial superpower.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Even if its position has been eroded by setbacks, imbalances, and weaknesses, the strength and influence of the US dollar will not be matched anytime soon.</p>
    <p>The United States still has the largest economy in the world and the&nbsp;<strong>U.S. dollar is the world&rsquo;s reserve currency</strong>.</p>
    <p>This means that the U.S. dollar is a participant in about 90% of all forex transactions, which makes U.S. news and data important to watch.</p>
    <p>With that said, let&rsquo;s take a look at some of the most volatile news for the U.S.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/freshman-most-volatile-news-reports2.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>In addition to inflation reports and central bank speeches, you should also pay attention to&nbsp;<strong>geopolitical news</strong>&nbsp;such as</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Pandemics</li>
    <li>Wars</li>
    <li>Natural disasters</li>
    <li>Political unrest and protests</li>
    <li>Upcoming elections</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Although these may not have as big an impact as the other news, it&rsquo;s still worth paying attention to them.</p>
    <p>When our economic nerd, Pippo, is in a good mood, he usually releases an article on upcoming news reports that you can play and with trade strategies to boot!</p>
    <p>Also, keep an eye on moves in the&nbsp;<strong>stock market</strong>. Especially the U.S. stock market.</p>
    <p>There are times when&nbsp;<strong>sentiment in the equity markets will be the precursor to major moves in the currency market</strong>.</p>
    <p>Now that we know which news events make the most moves, our next step is to determine which currency pairs are worth trading.</p>
    <h2>How to Choose Currency Pairs to Trade the News</h2>
    <p>After identifying the event to monitor, you now want to trade&nbsp;<strong>the currency associated with that event&rsquo;s economy</strong>.</p>
    <p>Choosing the appropriate currency pair is an important decision when &ldquo;Trading the News&rdquo;.</p>
    <p>As a news trader, you are trying to achieve two things:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Take advantage of the short-term spike in volatility&hellip;</li>
    <li>While keeping your transaction costs as low as possible</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Because news can bring increased volatility in the forex market (and more trading opportunities), it is important that we trade currencies that are&nbsp;<strong>deeply liquid.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Currencies with deep liquidity have the tightest spreads&nbsp;</strong>which are what allow you to keep your transaction costs low.</p>
    <p><strong>Liquid</strong>&nbsp;currency pairs give us reassurance that our orders will be executed smoothly and without any &ldquo;hiccups&rdquo;.</p>
    <ol>
    <li>EUR/USD</li>
    <li>GBP/USD</li>
    <li>USD/JPY</li>
    <li>USD/CHF</li>
    <li>USD/CAD</li>
    <li>AUD/USD</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Did you notice anything here?</p>
    <p>That&rsquo;s right! These are all&nbsp;<strong>major currency pairs</strong>!</p>
    <p>Remember, because they have the most liquidity, major pairs usually have the tightest spreads.</p>
    <p>Since spreads&nbsp;<em>widen</em>&nbsp;when news reports come out, it makes sense to stick with those pairs that have the tightest spreads, to begin with.</p>
    <p>Now that we know which news events and currency pairs to trade, let&rsquo;s take a look at some approaches to trading the news.</p>
