    <p>It&rsquo;s not enough to only know technical analysis when you trade. It&rsquo;s just as important to know what makes the forex market move.</p>
    <p>Just like in the great Star Wars world, behind the trend lines, double tops, and head and shoulder patterns, there is a fundamental force behind these movements.</p>
    <p>This force is called the&nbsp;<strong>news</strong>!</p>
    <p><img title="Forex News" src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/freshman-reading-news.png" />To understand the importance of the news, imagine this scenario (purely fictional of course!)</p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s say, on your nightly news, there is a report that the biggest software company just filed bankruptcy.</p>
    <p>You own shares of this company.</p>
    <p>What&rsquo;s the first thing you would do? How would your perception of this company change?</p>
    <p>How do you think other people&rsquo;s perceptions of this company would change?</p>
    <p>The obvious reaction would be that you would immediately sell off your shares.</p>
    <p>In fact, this is probably what just about everyone else who had any stake in that company would do.</p>
    <p>The fact is that news affects the way we perceive and act on our trading decisions. It&rsquo;s no different when it comes to trading currencies.</p>
    <p>There is, however, a distinct difference between how news is handled in the stock market and the forex market.</p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s go back to our example above and imagine that you heard that same report of the big software company filing bankruptcy, but let&rsquo;s say you heard the report a day before it was actually announced in the news.</p>
    <p><img title="Forex News Trading" src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/freshman-martha.png" /></p>
    <p>Naturally, you would sell off all your shares, and as a result of you hearing the news a day earlier, you would make (save) more money than everyone else who heard it on their nightly news.</p>
    <p>Sounds good for you right? Unfortunately, this little trick is called&nbsp;<strong>INSIDER TRADING</strong>, and it would have you thrown in jail.</p>
    <p>Martha Stewart did it and now she has a nice mug-shot to go along with her magazine covers.</p>
    <p>In the stock market, when you hear news before everyone else it is illegal. In the forex market, it&rsquo;s called&nbsp;<strong><em>FAIR GAME</em></strong>!</p>
    <p>The earlier you hear or see the news, the better it is for your trading, and there is absolutely no penalty for it!</p>
    <p>Add on some technology and the power of instant communication, and what you have is the latest and greatest (or not so greatest) news at the tip of your fingers.</p>
    <p>This is great&hellip; Uhmmm&hellip; &ldquo;news&rdquo; for retail traders because it allows the U.S. to react fairly quickly to the market&rsquo;s speculations.</p>
    <p>Big traders, small traders, husky traders, or skinny traders all have to depend on the same news to make the market move because if there wasn&rsquo;t any news, the market would hardly move at all!</p>
    <p>The news is important to the forex market because it&rsquo;s the news that makes it move.</p>
    <p>Regardless of the technicals, the news is the fuel that keeps the forex market going!</p>
