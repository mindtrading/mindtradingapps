    <p>When trading the news, you can either have a directional bias or a non-directional bias.</p>
    <p>Here are some other things to keep in mind when news trading:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>When you have a&nbsp;<strong>directional bias</strong>, you are expecting the price to move in a certain direction, and you&rsquo;ve got your orders in already.</li>
    <li>It is always good to understand the&nbsp;<strong>underlying reasons</strong>&nbsp;why the market moves in a certain direction when news is released.</li>
    <li>When you have a&nbsp;<strong>non-directional bias</strong>, you don&rsquo;t care which way price heads. You just want to get triggered.</li>
    <li>Setups for the non-directional bias are also called&nbsp;<strong>straddle trades</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>That&rsquo;s pretty much it&hellip;</p>
    <p>Is it really that easy???</p>
    <p>HECK NO!!!</p>
    <p>You&rsquo;ll have to&nbsp;<strong>practice and trade many different reports</strong>&nbsp;before you get a feel for:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Which news reports will make the market move</li>
    <li>How much of a surprise is needed for the market to move</li>
    <li>Which reports to avoid trading.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Like in any other trading method, your success depends on your preparation.</p>
    <p>This will take time and practice. Do your homework and study the economic indicators to understand why they are important.</p>
    <p>Remember, nothing worth having comes easy, so stick with it and you&rsquo;ll find that trading the news&nbsp;will be very rewarding once you get the hang of it!</p>
