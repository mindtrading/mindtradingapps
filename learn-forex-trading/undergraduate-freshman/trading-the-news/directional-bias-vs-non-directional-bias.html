    <p>There&rsquo;s no single strategy for trading the news.</p>
    <p>When the news hits, the price tends to spike in one direction or has a muted reaction to the data as traders digest the outcome against market expectations.</p>
    <p>Knowing this, there are two main approaches to trade the news:</p>
    <p>a) Having a&nbsp;<strong><em>directional bias</em></strong></p>
    <p>b) Having a&nbsp;<strong><em>non-directional bias</em></strong></p>
    <h2>Directional Bias</h2>
    <p>Having a directional bias means that you expect the market to move in a certain direction once the news report is released.</p>
    <p>When looking for a trade opportunity in a certain direction, it is good to know what it is about news reports that will cause the market to move.</p>

    <h3>Consensus vs. Actual Number</h3>
    <p>Several days or even weeks before a news report comes out, there are analysts that will come up with some kind of forecast on what numbers will be released.</p>
    <p>As we talked about in a previous lesson, this number will be different among various analysts, but in general, there will be a common number that a majority of them agree on.</p>
    <p>This number is called a&nbsp;<strong>consensus</strong>.</p>
    <p>When a news report is released, the number that is given is called the&nbsp;<strong>actual</strong>&nbsp;number.</p>
    <h3>&ldquo;Buy the rumor, sell on the news.&rdquo;</h3>
    <p>This is a common phrase used in the forex market because often times it seems that when a news report is released, the movement doesn&rsquo;t match what the report would lead you to believe.</p>
    <p>For example, let&rsquo;s say that the U.S. unemployment rate is expected to increase. Imagine that last month the unemployment rate was at 8.8% and the consensus for this upcoming report is 9.0%.</p>
    <p>With a consensus at 9.0%, it means that all the big market players are anticipating a weaker U.S. economy, and as a result, a weaker dollar.</p>
    <p>So with this anticipation, big market players aren&rsquo;t going to wait until the report is actually released to start acting on taking a position.</p>
    <p>They will go ahead and start selling off their dollars for other currencies before the actual number is released.</p>
    <p>Now let&rsquo;s say that the actual unemployment rate is released and as expected, it reports 9.0%.</p>
    <p>As a retail trader, you see this and think &ldquo;Okay, this is bad news for the U.S. It&rsquo;s time to short the dollar!&rdquo;</p>
    <p>However, when you go to your trading platform to start selling the dollar, you see that the markets aren&rsquo;t exactly moving in the direction you thought they would.</p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s actually moving up! What the heck! Whyyyyyy??</p>
    <p>This is because the big players have already adjusted their positions way before the news report even came out and may now be taking profits after the run-up to the news event.</p>
    <p>Now let&rsquo;s revisit this example, but this time, imagine that the actual report released an unemployment rate of 8.0%.</p>
    <p>The market players thought the unemployment rate would rise to 9.0% because of the consensus, but instead, the report showed that the rate actually decreased, showing strength for the dollar.</p>
    <p>What you would see on your charts would be a huge dollar rally across the board because the big market players didn&rsquo;t expect this to happen.</p>
    <p>Now that the report is released and it says something totally different from what they had anticipated, they are all trying to adjust their positions as fast as possible.</p>
    <p>This would also happen if the actual report released an unemployment rate of 10.0%.</p>
    <p>The only difference would be that instead of the dollar rallying, it would drop like a rock!</p>
    <p>Since the market consensus was 9.0% but the actual report showed a bigger 10.0% unemployment rate, the big players would sell off more of their dollars because the U.S. looks a lot weaker now than when the forecasts were first released.</p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s important to&nbsp;<strong>keep track of the market consensus and the actual numbers</strong>, you can better gauge which news reports will actually cause the market to move and in what direction.</p>
    <h2>Non-Directional&nbsp;Bias</h2>
    <p>A more common news trading strategy is the&nbsp;<strong>non-directional bias</strong>&nbsp;approach.</p>
    <p>This method disregards a directional bias and simply plays on the fact that a big news report will create a big move.</p>
    <p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter which way the forex market&nbsp;moves. We just want to be there when it does!</p>
    <p>What this means is that once the market moves in either direction, you have a plan in place to enter that trade.</p>
    <p>You don&rsquo;t have any bias as to whether the price will go up or down, hence the name&nbsp;<em>non-directional bias</em>.</p>
