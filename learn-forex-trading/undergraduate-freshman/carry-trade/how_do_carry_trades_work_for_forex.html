        <p>In the forex market, currencies are traded in&nbsp;<strong>pairs</strong>&nbsp;(for example, if you buy USD/CHF, you are actually buying the U.S. dollar and selling Swiss francs at the same time).</p>
        <p><strong>You pay interest on the currency position you SELL and collect interest on the currency position you BUY.</strong></p>
        What makes the carry trade special in the spot forex market is that interest payments happen every trading day based on your position.
        <p>Technically, all positions are closed at the end of the day in the spot forex market. You just don&rsquo;t see it happen if you hold a position to the next day.</p>
        <p>Brokers close and reopen your position, and then they debit/credit you the overnight interest rate differential between the two currencies.</p>
        <p>This is the cost of &ldquo;<strong>carrying</strong>&rdquo; (also known as &ldquo;<strong>rolling over</strong>&ldquo;) a position to the next day.</p>
        The amount of leverage available from forex brokers has made the carry trade very popular in the forex market.
        <p>Most forex trading is margin-based, meaning you only have to put up a small amount of the position and your broker will put up the rest. Many brokers ask as little as 1% or 2% of a position.</p>
        <h2>Currency Carry Trade Example</h2>
        <p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at a&nbsp;<strong>generic</strong>&nbsp;example to show how awesome this can be.</p>
        <p>For this example, we&rsquo;ll take a look at Joe the&nbsp;<strong>Newbie Forex Trader.</strong></p>
        <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2010/10/02194205/noob-forex-trader.png" /></p>
        <p>It&rsquo;s Joe&rsquo;s birthday and his grandparents, being the sweet and generous people they are, give him $10,000. Schweeeet!</p>
        <p>Instead of going out and blowing his birthday present on video games and posters of bubble gum pop stars, he decides to save it for a rainy day.</p>
        <p>Joe goes to the local bank to open up a savings account and the bank manager tells him, &ldquo;Joe, your savings account will pay 1% a year on your account balance. Isn&rsquo;t that fantastic?&rdquo;</p>
        Joe pauses and thinks to himself, &ldquo;At 1%, my $10,000 will earn me $100 in a year.&rdquo;
        <p>&ldquo;Man, that sucks!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Joe, being the smart guy he is, has been studying BabyPips.com&rsquo;s School of Pipsology and knows of a better way to invest his money.</p>
        <p>So, Joe kindly responds to the bank manager, &ldquo;Thank you sir, but I think I&rsquo;ll invest my money somewhere else.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Joe has been demo trading several systems (including the carry trade) for over a year, so he has a pretty good understanding of how forex trading works.</p>
        <p>He opens up a real account, deposits his $10,000 birthday gift, and puts his plan into action.</p>
        <p>Joe finds a currency pair whose interest rate differential is +5% a year and he purchases $100,000 worth of that pair.</p>
        Since his broker only requires a 1% deposit of the position, they hold&nbsp;<strong>$1,000 in margin</strong>&nbsp;(100:1 leverage).
        <p>So, Joe now controls $100,000 worth of a currency pair that is receiving 5% a year in interest.</p>
        <p>What will happen to Joe&rsquo;s account if he does nothing for a year?</p>
        <p>Well, here are 3 possibilities. Let&rsquo;s take a look at each one:</p>
        <ol>
        <li><strong>Currency position loses value.</strong>&nbsp;The currency pair Joe buys drops like a rock in value. If the loss brings the account down to the amount set aside for margin, then the position is closed and all that&rsquo;s left in the account is the margin &ndash; $1000.</li>
        <li><strong>The pair ends up at the same exchange rate at the end of the year.</strong>&nbsp;In this case, Joe did not gain or lose any value on his position, but he collected a 5% interest in the $100,000 position. That means on interest alone, Joe made $5,000 off of his $10,000 account. That&rsquo;s a 50% gain! Sweet!</li>
        <li><strong>Currency position gains value.</strong>&nbsp;Joe&rsquo;s pair shoots up like a rocket! So, not only does Joe collect at least $5,000 in interest on his position, but he also takes home any gains! That would be a nice present for himself for his next birthday!</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Because of 100:1 leverage, Joe has the potential to earn around 50% a year from his initial $10,000.</p>
        <p>Here is an example of a currency pair that offers a 4.40% differential rate based on interest rates in September 2010:</p>
        <p><img title="Long AUD/JPY Carry Trade" src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/freshman-audjpy-interest-differential-long.png"  /></p>
        <p>If you&nbsp;<strong>buy</strong>&nbsp;AUD/JPY and held it for a year, you earn a &ldquo;positive carry&rdquo; of +4.40%.</p>
        <p>Of course, if you&nbsp;<strong>sell</strong>&nbsp;AUD/JPY, it works the opposite way:</p>
        <p><img title="Short AUD/JPY Carry Trade" src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/freshman-audjpy-interest-differential-short.png"  /></p>
        <p>If you sold AUD/JPY and held it for a year, you would earn a &ldquo;<strong>negative carry</strong>&rdquo; of -4.40%.</p>
        <p>Again, this is a generic example of how the carry trade works.</p>
        <p>Any questions on the concept? No? We knew you could catch on quickly!</p>
        <p>Now it&rsquo;s time to move on to the most important part of this lesson:&nbsp;<strong>Carry Trade Risk</strong>.</p>
