        <p>Did you know there is a trading strategy that can make money if the price stayed exactly the same for long periods of time?</p>
        <p>Well, there is and it&rsquo;s one the most popular ways of making money by many of the biggest and baddest money manager mamajamas in the financial universe!</p>
        <p>It&rsquo;s called the &ldquo;<strong>Carry Trade</strong>&ldquo;.</p>
        <p><img title="Carry Trade" src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/freshman-carry-trade.png" alt="" /></p>
        <p><em>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired of carrying this!&rdquo;</em></p>
        <h2>What is a Carry Trade?</h2>
        <p>A carry trade involves borrowing or selling a financial instrument with a low interest rate, then using it to purchase a financial instrument with a higher interest rate.</p>
        While you are paying the low interest rate on the financial instrument you borrowed/sold, you are collecting higher interest on the financial instrument you purchased.
        <p>So your profit is the money you collect from the&nbsp;<strong>interest rate differential</strong>.</p>
        <h3>Carry Trade Example:</h3>
        <p>Let&rsquo;s say you go to a bank and borrow $10,000.</p>
        <p>Their&nbsp;<strong>lending fee is 1%</strong>&nbsp;of the $10,000 every year.</p>
        <p>With that borrowed money, you turn around and purchase a $10,000 bond that&nbsp;<strong>pays 5%</strong>&nbsp;a year.</p>
        <p>What&rsquo;s your profit?</p>
        <p>Anyone?</p>
        <p>You got it! It&rsquo;s 4% a year!&nbsp;<strong>The difference between interest rates!</strong></p>
        By now you&rsquo;re probably thinking, &ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t sound as exciting or profitable as catching swings in the market.&rdquo;
        <p>However, when you apply it to the spot forex market, with its higher leverage and daily interest payments, sitting back and watching your account grow daily can get pretty sexy.</p>
        <p>To give you an idea, a 3% interest rate differential becomes 60% annual interest a year on an account that is 20 times leveraged!</p>
        <h3>Leveraged Carry Trade Example:</h3>
        <p>Let&rsquo;s say you borrow $1,000,000 at an interest rate of 1%.</p>
        <p>The bank won&rsquo;t just lend a million bucks to anybody though. It requires cash collateral from you:&nbsp;<strong>$10,000</strong>.</p>
        <p>You&rsquo;ll get it back once you pay back the money.</p>
        <p>Your loan is approved so fill up your backpack with cash.</p>
        <p>Then you turn around, walk across the street to another bank and deposit the $1,000,000 in a savings account that pays 5% a year.</p>
        <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2010/10/carry-trade-cash.png" alt="" />A year passes. What&rsquo;s your profit?</p>
        <p>You&nbsp;<em>earned</em>&nbsp;$50,000 in interest from the bond ($1,000,000 * .05).</p>
        <p>You&nbsp;<em>paid</em>&nbsp;$10,000 in interest ($1,000,000 * .01).</p>
        <p>So your net profit is $40,000.</p>
        <p><strong>With a measly $10,000, you earned $40,000!&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>That&rsquo;s a 400% return!</p>
        In this section, we will discuss how carry trades work, when they will work, and when they will NOT work.
        <p>We will also tackle&nbsp;<strong>risk aversion</strong></p>
        <p>WTH is that?!?&nbsp;Don&rsquo;t worry, we&rsquo;ll be talking more about it later).</p>
