    <p>Let&rsquo;s go over the criteria for a carry trade.</p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s pretty simple to find a suitable pair to do a carry trade. Look for two things:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Find a high interest differential.</li>
    <li>Find a pair that has been stable or in an uptrend in favor of the higher-yielding currency. This gives you the ability to stay in the trade&nbsp;<strong>AS LONG AS POSSIBLE</strong>&nbsp;and profit from the interest rate differential.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Pretty simple, huh?</p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s take a real life example of the carry trade in action:</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/freshman-audjpy-weekly-carry-trade.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>This is a weekly chart of AUD/JPY. During this time, the Bank of Japan had maintained a &ldquo;Zero Interest Rate Policy&rdquo; with the interest rate near zero at 0.10%).</p>
    <p>Also known as ZIRP.</p>
    <p>With the Reserve Bank of Australia touting one of the higher interest rates among the major currencies (4.50% in the chart example), many traders flocked to this pair (one of the factors creating a nice little uptrend in the pair).</p>
    <p>From the start of 2009 to early 2010, this pair moved from a price of 55.50 to 88.00.</p>
    <p>That&rsquo;s 3,250 pips!</p>
    <p>If you couple that with interest payments from the interest rate differential of the two currencies, this pair has been a nice long-term play for many investors and traders able to weather the volatile up and down movements of the currency market.</p>
    <p>Of course, economic and political factors are changing daily.</p>
    <p>Interest rates and interest rate differentials between currencies may change as well, bringing popular carry trades (such as the yen carry trade) out of favor with investors.</p>
    <h2>Carry Trade Risk</h2>
    <p>Because you are a very smart trader, you already know what the first question you should ask before entering a trade is right?</p>
    <p><strong>&ldquo;What is my risk?&rdquo;</strong></p>
    <p>Correct! Before entering a trade you must&nbsp;<strong>ALWAYS</strong>&nbsp;assess your max risk and whether or not it is acceptable according to your risk management rules.</p>
    <p>In the example at the start of the lesson with Joe the Newbie Forex Trader, his maximum risk would have been $9,000. His position would be automatically closed out once his losses hit $9,000.</p>
    <p>Eh?</p>
    <p>That doesn&rsquo;t sound very good, does it?</p>
    <p>Remember, this is the worst possible scenario and Joe is a newbie, so he hasn&rsquo;t fully appreciated the value of stop losses.</p>
    <p>When doing a carry trade, you can still limit your losses like a regular directional trade.</p>
    <p>For instance, if Joe decided that he wanted to limit his risk to $1,000, he could set a stop order to close his position at whatever the price level would be for that $1,000 loss.</p>
    <p>He would still keep any interest payments he received while holding onto the position.</p>
