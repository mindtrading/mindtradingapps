    <p>When do carry trades work?</p>
    <p>Carry trades work best when investors&nbsp;<strong><em>feel</em></strong>&nbsp;risky and&nbsp;<strong>optimistic</strong>&nbsp;enough to buy high-yielding currencies and sell lower-yielding currencies.</p>
    <p><img title="Know When Carry Trades Work and When They Don't" src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/freshman-half-full.png"  /></p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s kinda like an optimist who sees the glass half full. While the current situation might not be ideal, he is hopeful that things will get better.</p>
    <p>The same goes for carry trade.</p>
    <p>Economic conditions may not be good, but the&nbsp;<strong>outlook of the buying currency does need to be positive</strong>.</p>
    <p>If the outlook of a country&rsquo;s economy looks as good as Angelina Jolie or Brad Pitt, then chances are that the country&rsquo;s central bank will have to raise interest rates in order to control inflation.</p>
    <p>This is good for the&nbsp;carry trade because a higher interest rate means a bigger interest rate differential.</p>
    <h2>When Do Carry Trades NOT Work?</h2>
    <p>On the other hand, if a country&rsquo;s economic prospects aren&rsquo;t looking too good, then nobody will be prepared to take on the currency.</p>
    <p>Especially if the market thinks the central bank will have to lower interest rates to help their economy.</p>
    <p>To put it simply, carry trades work best when investors have&nbsp;<strong><em>low risk aversion</em></strong>.</p>
    <p>Carry trades do not work well when risk aversion is HIGH&nbsp;(i.e. selling higher-yielding currencies and buying back lower-yielding currencies).</p>
    <p><strong>When risk aversion is high, investors are less likely to take risky ventures.</strong></p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s put this into perspective.</p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s say economic conditions are tough, and the country is currently undergoing a recession. What do you think your next-door neighbor would do with his money?</p>
    <p>Your neighbor would probably choose a low-paying yet safe investment then&nbsp;put it somewhere else. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if the return is low as long as the investment is a &ldquo;sure thing.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Finding yield is not the priority anymore. preserving principal is.</p>
    <p>This makes sense because this allows your neighbor to have a fallback plan in the event that things go bad, like if he loses his job.</p>
    <p>In forex jargon, your neighbor is said to have a high level of&nbsp;<strong><em>risk aversion</em></strong>.</p>
    <p>The psychology of big investors isn&rsquo;t that much different from your next-door neighbor.</p>
    <p><strong>Risk aversion</strong>&nbsp;refers to when traders unload their positions in higher-yielding assets and move their capital in favor of safe-haven currencies.</p>
    <p>This normally happens in times of&nbsp;<strong>uncertainty.</strong></p>
    <p>When economic conditions are uncertain, investors tend to put their investments in safe haven currencies that offer low interest rates like the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen.</p>
    <p>This is the polar opposite of carry trade. This inflow of capital towards safe assets causes currencies with low interest to appreciate against those with high interest.</p>
