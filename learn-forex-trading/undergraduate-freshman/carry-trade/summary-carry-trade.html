    <p>A&nbsp;<strong>carry trade</strong>&nbsp;is when you borrow one financial instrument (like USD currency) and use that to buy another financial instrument (like JPY currency).</p>
    <p>While you are paying the low interest rate on the financial instrument you borrowed/sold, you are collecting higher interest on the financial instrument you purchased.</p>
    <p>Your profit is the money you collect from the&nbsp;<strong>interest rate differential</strong>.</p>
    <p>This is another way to make money in the forex market without having to buy low and sell high, which can be pretty tough to do day after day.</p>

    <p>Carry trades work best when investors&nbsp;<strong><em>feel</em></strong>&nbsp;like taking on risk. Current economic conditions need not be good, but the outlook does need to be positive.</p>
    <p>If a country&rsquo;s economic prospects aren&rsquo;t looking too good, then nobody will be prepared to take on the risk.</p>
    <p>To put it simply, carry trades work best when investors have&nbsp;<strong><em>low risk aversion</em></strong>.</p>
    <p><strong>Carry trades do not work well when risk aversion is HIGH.</strong></p>
    <p>When risk aversion is high, investors are less likely to buy higher-yielding currencies or likely to reduce their positions in higher-yielding currencies.</p>
    <p>When economic conditions are uncertain, investors tend to put their investments in safe haven currencies, which tend to offer low interest rates like the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen.</p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s pretty simple to find a suitable pair to do a carry trade. Look for two things:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Find a high interest differential.</li>
    <li>Find a pair that has been stable or in an uptrend in favor of the higher-yielding currency. This gives you the ability to stay in the trade&nbsp;<strong>AS LONG AS POSSIBLE</strong>&nbsp;and profit from the interest rate differential.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Always remember that&nbsp;<strong>economic and political factors</strong>&nbsp;are changing the world daily.</p>
    <p>Interest rates and interest rate differentials between currencies may change as well, bringing popular carry trades (such as the yen carry trade) out of favor with investors.</p>
    <p>So when doing a carry trade, you should still limit your losses like a regular directional trade.</p>
    <p>When properly applied, the carry trade can add significant income to your account, along with your directional trading strategies.</p>
