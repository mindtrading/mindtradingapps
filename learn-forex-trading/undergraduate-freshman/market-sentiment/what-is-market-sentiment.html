    <p><strong>How&rsquo;s Mr. Market feeling?</strong></p>
    <p>Every forex trader will always have an opinion about the market.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bear market, everything is going to hell!&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Things are looking bright. I&rsquo;m pretty bullish on the markets right now.&rdquo;</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/freshman-bear-bull.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>Each and every trader will have their own personal explanation as to why the market is moving a certain way.</p>
    <p>When trading, traders express this view in whatever trade he takes.</p>
    <p>But sometimes, no matter how convinced a trader is that the markets will move in a particular direction, and no matter how pretty all the trend lines line up, the trader may still end up losing.</p>
    <p>A forex trader must realize that the overall market is a combination of all the views, ideas, and opinions of all the participants in the market. That&rsquo;s right&hellip; EVERYONE.</p>
    <p>This combined feeling that market participants have is what we call&nbsp;<strong>market sentiment</strong>.</p>
    <p>It is the dominating emotion or idea that the majority of the market feels best explains the current direction of the market.</p>

    <h2>How to Develop a Market Sentiment-Based Approach</h2>
    <p>As a forex trader, it is your job to gauge what the market is feeling. Are the indicators pointing towards bullish conditions?</p>
    <p>Are traders bearish on the economy?</p>
    <p>We can&rsquo;t tell the market what we think it should do. But what we can do is react in response to what is happening in the markets.</p>
    <p>Note that using the market sentiment approach doesn&rsquo;t give a precise entry and exit for each trade. But don&rsquo;t despair!</p>
    <p>Having a sentiment-based approach can help you decide whether you should go with the flow or not.</p>
    <p>Of course, you can always combine market sentiment analysis with technical and fundamental analysis to come up with better trade ideas.</p>
    <p>In stocks and options, traders can look at&nbsp;<strong>volume</strong>&nbsp;traded as an indicator of sentiment.</p>
    <p>If a stock price has been rising, but volume is declining, it may signal that the market is overbought.</p>
    <p>Or if a declining stock suddenly reversed on high volume, it means the market sentiment may have changed from bearish to bullish.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, since the forex market is traded over-the-counter, it doesn&rsquo;t have a centralized market. This means that the volume of each currency traded cannot be easily measured.</p>

    <p>GASP!</p>
    <p>OH NOOOO!!!!</p>
    <p>Without any tools to measure volume, how can a forex trader measure market sentiment?!</p>
    <p>This is where the&nbsp;<strong>Commitment of Traders</strong>&nbsp;report comes in!</p>
