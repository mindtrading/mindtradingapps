    <p>Now that we know how to determine sentiment extremes, what&rsquo;s next?</p>
    <p>Recall that not every sentiment extreme results in a market top or bottom so we&rsquo;ll need a more accurate indicator.</p>
    <p>Calculating the percentage of speculative positions that are long or short would be a better gauge to see whether the market is topping or bottoming out.</p>
    <p>The equation to calculate for the %-long and %-short is indicated below:</p>
    <div title="COT Report"><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2010/11/long-short-300x117.png" alt="" /></div>
    <p>To illustrate this better, let&rsquo;s go back a few years and see what happened with Canadian dollar futures.</p>
    <p>Going through the COT reports released on the week ending August 22, 2008,&nbsp;<strong>speculators were net short 28,085 contracts</strong>.</p>
    <p>On March 20, 2009, they were&nbsp;<strong>net short 23,950 contracts</strong>.</p>
    <p>From this information alone, you would say that there is a higher probability of a market bottom in August since there were more speculators that were short in that period.</p>
    <p>But hold on a minute there&hellip; You didn&rsquo;t think it would be THAT easy right?</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/freshman-short-ratio2-2.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>A closer look would show that 66,726 contracts were short while 38,641 contracts were long. Out of all the speculative positions in&nbsp;<strong>August</strong>&nbsp;(66,726 / (38,641 + 66,726)),&nbsp;<strong>63.3%</strong>&nbsp;were short positions.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, there were just 8,715 long contracts and 32,665 short contracts in&nbsp;<strong>March</strong>.</p>
    <p>This means that (32,655 / (8,715 + 32,665))&nbsp;<strong>78.9%</strong>&nbsp;of the speculative positions were short positions during that period. What does this mean?</p>
    <p><strong>There is a higher chance that a bottom will occur when 78.9% of all speculative positions are short as opposed to just 63.3%.</strong></p>
    <p>As you can see on the chart above, the bottom, in fact, did not occur around August 2008, when the Canadian dollar was worth roughly around 94 U.S. cents.</p>
    <p>The Canadian dollar continued to fall over the next few months.</p>
    <p>By the time March came around and the %-short ratio hit 78.9%, the Canadian dollar had hit a bottom around 77 U.S. cents.</p>
    <p>Then what happened? It started to steadily rise!</p>
    <p>A market bottom? Yep, you got it.</p>
