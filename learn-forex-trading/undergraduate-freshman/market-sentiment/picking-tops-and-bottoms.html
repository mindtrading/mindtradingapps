    <p>As you would&rsquo;ve guessed, ideal places to go long and short are those times when sentiment is at an&nbsp;<em>extreme</em>.</p>
    <p>If you noticed from the previous example, the speculators (green line) and commercials (blue line) gave opposite signals.</p>
    <p>While&nbsp;<strong>hedgers buy when the market is bottoming, speculators sell as the price moves down</strong>.</p>
    <p>Here&rsquo;s that COT report chart again:</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/freshman-cot-indicator-eur-globex.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>Hedgers are bearish when the market moves to the top while speculators are bullish when the price is climbing.</p>
    <p>As a result,&nbsp;<strong>speculative positioning indicates trend direction</strong>&nbsp;while&nbsp;<strong>commercial positioning could signal reversals</strong>.</p>
    <p>If hedgers keep increasing their long positions while speculators increase their short positions, a market bottom could be in sight.</p>
    <p>If hedgers keep adding more short positions while speculators keep adding more long positions, a market top could occur.</p>
    <p>Of course, it&rsquo;s difficult to determine the exact point where a sentiment extreme will occur so it might be best to do nothing until signs of an actual reversal are seen.</p>
    <p>We could say that speculators, because they follow the trend, catch most of the move BUT are wrong on turning points.</p>
    <p>Commercial traders, on the other hand, miss most of the trend EXCEPT when price reverses.</p>
    <p>Until a sentiment extreme occurs, it would be best to go with the speculators.</p>
    <p><strong>The basic rule is this: every market top or bottom is accompanied by a sentiment extreme, but not every sentiment extreme results in a market top or bottom.</strong></p>
