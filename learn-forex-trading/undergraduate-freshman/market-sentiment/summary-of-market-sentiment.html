    <p>Did those thousand-pip moves excite you?</p>
    <p>Before we start betting the farm based on our analysis of the COT report, remember that those were just specific cases of when the COT report signaled a perfect market reversal.</p>
    <p>The best thing to do would be to backtest and look at reasons why a reversal took place.</p>
    <p>Was the economy booming?</p>
    <p>Or was it in the middle of a recession?</p>
    <p>Remember, the COT report&nbsp;<strong>measures the sentiment of traders during a specific period of time</strong>.</p>
    <p>Like every other tool in your toolbox, using the COT report as an indicator does not always correlate to market reversals.</p>
    <p>So take the time to study this report and get your own feel of what works and what doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
    <p>Also, before we bring this lesson to an end, always keep in mind that market prices aren&rsquo;t driven by solely COT reports, Stochastic, Fibonacci levels, etc.</p>
    <p>The markets are driven by the millions of people reacting to economic analysis, fundamental reports, politics, Godzilla attacks, UFO sightings, Lady Gaga concerts &ndash; life in general!</p>
    <p>It is how you use these tools that will help you be prepared for what lies ahead.</p>
    <p>In conclusion&hellip;</p>
    <ul>
    <li>As forex traders, it is our job to&nbsp;<strong>gauge what the market is feeling</strong>.</li>
    <li>One way to gauge market sentiment extremes is through the Commitment of Traders Report.</li>
    <li>By understanding the activities of the&nbsp;<strong>three groups of traders</strong>&nbsp;(commercial traders, non-commercial, retail traders), we can find ourselves in better positions to fish for tops and bottoms.</li>
    <li>Remember, every market top or bottom is accompanied by a&nbsp;<strong>sentiment extreme</strong>, but not every sentiment extreme results in a market top or bottom.</li>
