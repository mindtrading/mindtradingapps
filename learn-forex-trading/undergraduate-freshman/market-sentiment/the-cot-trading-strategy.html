    <p>Since the COT report comes out weekly, its usefulness as a market sentiment indicator would be more suitable for longer-term trades.</p>
    <p>The question you may be asking now is this:</p>
    <p>How the heck do you turn all that &ldquo;big giant gobbled-up block of text&rdquo; into a sentiment-based indicator that will help you grab some pips?!</p>
    <p>One way to use the COT report in your trading is to find&nbsp;<strong>extreme net long or net short positions</strong>.</p>
    <p>Finding these positions may signal that a market reversal is just around the corner because if everyone is long a currency, who is left to buy?</p>
    <p>No one.</p>
    <p>And if everyone is short a currency, who is left to sell?</p>
    <p>What&rsquo;s that?</p>
    <p>Pretty quiet&hellip;</p>
    <p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s right. NO ONE.</p>
    <p>One analogy to keep in mind is to imagine driving down a road and hitting a dead end. What happens if you hit that dead end?</p>
    <p>You can&rsquo;t keep going since there&rsquo;s no more road ahead. The only thing to do is to turn back.</p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at this chart of the EUR/USD:</p>
    <p><img title="COT Report: EUR Globex" src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/freshman-cot-indicator-eur-globex.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>On the top half, we&rsquo;ve got the price action of EUR/USD going on. At the same time, on the bottom half, we&rsquo;ve got data on the long and short positions of EUR futures, divided into three categories:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Commercial traders (blue)</li>
    <li>Large Non-commercial (green)</li>
    <li>Small non-commercial (red)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Ignore the commercial positions for now, since those are mainly for hedging while small retail traders aren&rsquo;t relevant.</p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at what happened mid-way through 2008. As you can see, EUR/USD made a steady decline from July to September.</p>
    <p>As the value of the&nbsp;<strong>net short positions of non-commercial traders</strong>&nbsp;(the green line) dropped, so did EUR/USD.</p>
    <p>In the middle of September,&nbsp;<strong>net short positions hit an extreme of 45,650</strong>. Soon after, investors started to buy back EUR futures.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, EUR/USD rose sharply from about 1.2400 to a high near 1.4700!</p>
    <p>Over the next year, the net value of EUR futures position gradually turned positive. As expected, EUR/USD eventually followed suit, even hitting a new high around 1.5100.</p>
    <p>In early October 2009, EUR futures&nbsp;<strong>net long positions hit an extreme of 51,000</strong>&nbsp;before reversing. Shortly after, EUR/USD began to decline as well.</p>
    <p>Holy Guacamole! Just by using the COT as an indicator, you could have caught two crazy moves from October 2008 to January 2009 and November 2009 to March 2010.</p>
    <p>The first was in mid-September 2009.</p>
    <p>If you had seen that speculative traders&rsquo; short positions were at extreme levels, you could have bought EUR/USD at around 1.2300.</p>
    <p>This would have resulted in almost a 2,000-pip gain in a matter of a few months!</p>
    <p>Now, if you had also seen that net long positions were at an extreme in November 2009, you would have had sold EUR/USD and you could have grabbed about 1,500 pips!</p>
    <p>With those two moves,&nbsp;by<strong>&nbsp;using the&nbsp;</strong><strong>COT report as a market sentiment reversal indicator</strong>, you could have grabbed a total of 3,500 pips. Pretty nifty, eh?</p>
