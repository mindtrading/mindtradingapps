    <p>Let&rsquo;s now learn about the COT Report.</p>
    <p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, or CFTC, publishes the Commitment of Traders report (COT) every Friday, around 2:30 pm EST.</p>
    <p>Because the COT measures the net long and short positions taken by speculative traders and commercial traders, it is a great resource to gauge how heavily these market players are positioned in the market.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2010/11/08211134/soccer-players-780x455.jpg" /><br />Later on, we&rsquo;ll let you meet these market players. These are the&nbsp;<strong>hedgers, large speculators, and retail traders</strong>.</p>
    <p>Just like players in a team sport, each group has its unique characteristics and roles.</p>
    <p>By watching the behavior of these players, you&rsquo;ll be able to foresee incoming changes in market sentiment.</p>
    <p>You&rsquo;re probably asking yourself, &ldquo;Why the heck do I need to use data from the FX futures market?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t the spot FX market have a report that measures how currency traders are positioned?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a spot forex&nbsp;trader! Activity in the futures market doesn&rsquo;t involve me.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Remember, since spot forex&nbsp;is traded over-the-counter (OTC), transactions do not pass through a centralized exchange like&nbsp;the&nbsp;Chicago Mercantile Exchange.</p>
    <p>So what&rsquo;s the closest thing we can get our hands on to see the state of the market and how the big players are moving their money?</p>
    <p>Yep, you got it&hellip;</p>
    <p><strong>The Commitment of Traders Report from the futures market.</strong></p>
