    <p>In order to understand the futures market, first, you need to know the people making the shots and those who are warming up the bench.</p>
    <p>These players could be categorized into three basic groups:</p>
    <ol>
    <li><strong>Commercial traders</strong>&nbsp;(Hedgers)</li>
    <li><strong>Non-commercial traders</strong>&nbsp;(Large Speculators)</li>
    <li><strong>Retail traders</strong>&nbsp;(Small Speculators)</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Don&rsquo;t Ignore the Commercial&nbsp;Traders</h2>
    <p>Hedgers or commercial traders are those who want to protect themselves against unexpected price movements.</p>
    <p>Agricultural producers or farmers who want to hedge (minimize) their risk in changing commodity prices are part of this group.</p>
    <p>Banks or corporations who are looking to protect themselves against sudden price changes in currencies or other assets are also considered commercial traders.</p>
    <p>A key characteristic of hedgers is that they are&nbsp;<strong><em>most bullish at market bottoms</em></strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong><em>most bearish at market tops</em></strong>.</p>
    <p>What the hedgehog does this mean?</p>
    <p><img title="COT Report: Hedger or Commercial Trader" src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/freshman-zombie.png" /></p>
    <p>Here&rsquo;s a real-life example to illustrate:</p>
    <p>There is a virus outbreak in the U.S. that turns people into zombies. Zombies run amok doing malicious things like grabbing strangers&rsquo; iPhones to download fart apps.</p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s total mayhem as people become disoriented and helpless without their beloved iPhones. This must be stopped now before the nation crumbles into oblivion!</p>
    <p>Guns and bullets apparently don&rsquo;t work on the zombies. The only way to exterminate them is by chopping their heads off.</p>
    <p>Apple sees a &ldquo;market need&rdquo; and decides to build a private Samurai army to protect vulnerable iPhone users.</p>
    <p>It needs to import samurai swords from Japan. Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple,&nbsp;contacts a Japanese samurai swordsmith who demands to be paid in Japanese yen when he finishes the swords after three months.</p>
    <p>Apple also knows that, if the USD/JPY falls, it will end up paying more yen for the swords.</p>
    <p>In order to protect itself, or rather, hedge against currency risk, the firm buys JPY futures.</p>
    <p>If USD/JPY falls after three months, the firm&rsquo;s gain on the futures contract would offset the increased cost of its transaction with the Japanese swordsmith.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, if USD/JPY rises after three months, the firm&rsquo;s loss on the futures contract would be offset by the decrease in the cost of its payment for the samurai swords.</p>
    <h2>In It to Win It &ndash; The Large Speculators</h2>
    <p>In contrast to hedgers, who are not interested in making profits from trading activities, speculators are in it for the money and have no interest in owning the underlying asset!</p>
    <p>Many speculators are known as hardcore trend followers since they buy when the market is on an uptrend and sell when the market is on a downtrend.</p>
    <p>They keep adding to their position until the price movement reverses.</p>
    <p>Large speculators are also big players in the futures market since they hold huge accounts.</p>
    <p>As a result, their trading activities can cause the market to move dramatically. They usually follow moving averages and hold their positions until the trend changes.</p>
    <h2>Cannon fodders &ndash; The Small Speculators</h2>
    <p>Small speculators, on the other hand, own smaller retail accounts. These comprise of hedge funds and individual traders.</p>
    <p>They are known to be anti-trend and are usually on the&nbsp;<strong>wrong side of the market</strong>. Because of that, they are typically less successful than hedgers and commercial traders.</p>
    <p>However, when they do follow the trend, they tend to be highly&nbsp;<strong>concentrated at market tops or bottoms</strong>.</p>
