    <p>Breakout begins with eight rows of bricks, with every two rows a different color.</p>
    <p>The color order from the bottom up is yellow, green, orange, and red. Using a single ball&hellip;</p>
    <p>Oh snap! Wrong lesson!</p>
    <p>We&rsquo;re supposed to be talking about&nbsp;<strong>trading breakouts</strong>, not&nbsp;<em>playing</em>&nbsp;Breakout!</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2010/12/breakout.gif" alt="" /></p>
    <p>Sorry about that. Where were we&hellip;</p>
    <p>When&nbsp;<strong>trading breakouts</strong>&nbsp;in forex, it is important to realize that there are two main types:</p>
    <ol>
    <li><strong>Continuation breakouts</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Reversal breakouts</strong></li>
    </ol>
    <p>Knowing what type of breakout you are seeing will help you make sense of what is actually happening in the big picture of the market.</p>
    <p>Breakouts are significant because they indicate a change in the supply and demand of the currency pair you are trading.</p>
    <p>This change in sentiment can cause extensive moves that provide excellent opportunities for you to grab some pips.</p>
    <h2>Continuation Breakouts</h2>
    <p>Sometimes when there is an extensive move in one direction the market will often take a breather.</p>
    <p>This occurs when buyers and sellers pause to see what they should do next.</p>
    <p>As a result, you will see a period of range-bound movement called consolidation.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade13-continuation-breakout-before.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>If traders decide that the initial trend was the right decision, and continue to push the price in the same direction, the result is a&nbsp;<strong>continuation breakout</strong>. Just think of it as a &ldquo;continuation&rdquo; of the initial trend&hellip; You&rsquo;re so smart!</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade13-continuation-breakout-after.png" alt="" /></p>
    <h2>Reversal Breakouts</h2>
    <p><strong>Reversal breakouts</strong>&nbsp;start off the same way as continuation breakouts in the fact that after a long trend, there tends to be a pause or consolidation.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade13-reversal-breakout-before.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>The only difference is that after this consolidation, forex traders decide that the trend is exhausted and push the price in the opposite or &ldquo;reverse&rdquo; direction.</p>
    <p>As a result, you have what is called a &ldquo;reversal breakout&rdquo;. You catch on quick!</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade13-reversal-breakout-after.png" alt="" /></p>
    <h2>False Breakouts</h2>
    <p>Now we know by now you are super excited to start trading breakouts but you also have to be careful.</p>
    <p>Just like&nbsp;Lionel Messi&nbsp;can fake out defenders, the market can fake you out as well and produce false breakouts.</p>
    <p><strong>False breakouts</strong>&nbsp;occur when the price breaks past a certain level (support, resistance, triangle, trend line, etc.) but don&rsquo;t continue to accelerate in that direction.</p>
    <p>Instead, what you might&rsquo;ve seen was a short spike followed by the price moving back into its trading range.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade13-false-breakout.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>A good way to enter on a breakout is to&nbsp;<strong>wait until the price retraces back to the original breakout level</strong>&nbsp;and then wait to see if it bounces back to create a new high or low (depending on which direction you are trading).</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade13-false-breakout-entry.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>Another way to combat fakeouts is by&nbsp;<strong>not taking the first breakout you see</strong>.</p>
    <p>By waiting to see if the price will continue to move in your intended direction, you give yourself a better chance of making a profitable trade.</p>
    <p>The downside to this is that you may miss out on some trades in which the price moves quickly without any hesitation.</p>
