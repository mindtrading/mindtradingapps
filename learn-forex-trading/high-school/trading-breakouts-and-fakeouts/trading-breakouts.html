   <p><strong>What are breakouts and how can I take advantage of them?</strong></p>
   <p>Unlike the breakouts you might have had as a teenager, a breakout in the trading world is a little different!</p>
   <p>A&nbsp;<strong>breakout</strong>&nbsp;occurs when the price &ldquo;breaks out&rdquo; (get it?) of some kind of consolidation or trading range.</p>
   <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade13-pimples.png" alt="" />A breakout can also occur when a specific price level is breached such as support and resistance levels, pivot points, Fibonacci levels, etc.</p>
   <p>With breakout trades, the goal is to enter the market right when the price makes a breakout and then continue to ride the trade until volatility dies down.</p>
   <h2>Volatility, Not Volume</h2>
   <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade13-volatility-volume2.png" alt="" /></p>
   <p>You&rsquo;ll notice that, unlike trading stocks or futures, there is no way for you to see the volume of trades made in the forex market.</p>
   <p>With stock or futures trades,&nbsp;<strong>volume</strong>&nbsp;is essential for making good breakout trades so not having this data available in the forex leaves us at a disadvantage.</p>
   <p>Because of this disadvantage, we have to rely not only on<strong>&nbsp;good risk management</strong>&nbsp;but also on certain criteria in order to position ourselves for a good potential breakout.</p>
   <p>If there is a large price movement within a short amount of time then volatility would be considered high.</p>
   <p>On the other hand, if there is relatively little movement in a short period of time then volatility would be considered low.</p>
   <p>While it&rsquo;s tempting to get in the market when it is moving faster than a speeding bullet, you will often find yourself more stressed and anxious; making bad decisions as your money goes in and then goes right back out.</p>
   <p>This high volatility is what attracts a lot of forex traders, but it&rsquo;s this same volatility that kills a lot of them as well.</p>
   <p>The goal here is to&nbsp;<strong>use volatility to your advantage</strong>.</p>
   <p>Rather than following the herd and trying to jump in when the market is super volatile, it would be better to look for currency pairs with very low volatility.</p>
   <p>This way, you can position yourself and be ready for when a breakout occurs, and volatility&nbsp;skyrockets!</p>
