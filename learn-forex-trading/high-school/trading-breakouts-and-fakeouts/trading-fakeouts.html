    <p>Breakouts are popular among forex traders.</p>
    <p>It makes sense right?</p>
    <p>When price finally &ldquo;breaks&rdquo; out of that support or resistance level, one would expect the price to keep moving in the same direction as the break.</p>
    <p>There must have been enough momentum building up in order for price to have broken out of the level, right?</p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s time to hop aboard that train. It&rsquo;s all smooth sailing now. All you have to do is just wait for it&hellip;</p>
    <p>Yes, wait for it&hellip;</p>

    <p>Wait for it&hellip; Just a few more moments&hellip; To see price inch one direction&hellip; Then suddenly move miles in the opposite direction!</p>

    <p>Huh?!? What the heck?! What happened to &ldquo;the bread and butter and the end of world hunger&rdquo; strategy?</p>
    <p>End of story: You are left eating ketchup packets and crackers like Tom Hanks in The Terminal.</p>
    <h2>Support and Resistance Levels Are Tricky</h2>
    <p>One thing you should remember to note about support and resistance levels is that they are&nbsp;<em>areas</em>&nbsp;in which a predictable price response can be expected.</p>
    <h3>Support Levels</h3>
    <p><strong>Support levels</strong>&nbsp;are areas where buying pressure is just enough to overcome selling pressure and halt or reverse a downtrend.</p>
    <p>A strong support level is more likely to hold up even if the price breaks the support level and it provides traders a good&nbsp;<em>buying</em>&nbsp;opportunity.</p>
    <h3>Resistance Levels</h3>
    <p><strong>Resistance levels</strong>&nbsp;are just like support levels but work in the opposite way. They tend to halt or even reverse uptrends.</p>
    <p>Resistance levels are areas in which selling pressure is just enough to overcome buying pressure and force price back down.</p>
    <p>Strong resistance levels are more likely to hold up even if the price temporarily breaks the resistance level and it provides traders a good selling opportunity.</p>
    <p>In the next section, we will dive deeper into fakeouts and discuss why we should trade them and how to profit off them.</p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s not enough learning about breakout strategies because there will be times that breakouts FAIL. We have to know what to do in case of&nbsp;<strong>fakeouts.</strong></p>
    <p>This is part of your Jedi forex training. To be a Jedi master, you must be able to master fakeouts.</p>
