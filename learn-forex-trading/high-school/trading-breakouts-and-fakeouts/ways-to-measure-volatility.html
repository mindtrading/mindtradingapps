    <p><strong>Volatility</strong>&nbsp;is something that we can use when looking for good breakout trade opportunities.</p>
    <p>Volatility measures the overall price fluctuations over a certain time and this information can be used to detect potential breakouts.</p>
    <p>There are a few indicators that can help you gauge a pair&rsquo;s current volatility.</p>
    <p>Using these indicators can help you tremendously when looking for breakout opportunities.</p>
    <h2>1. Moving Average</h2>
    <p><strong>Moving averages</strong>&nbsp;are probably the most common indicator used by forex traders and although it is a simple tool, it provides invaluable data.</p>
    <p>Simply put, moving averages measures the average movement of the market for an X amount of time, where X is whatever you want it to be.</p>
    <p>For example, if you applied a&nbsp;<strong>20 SMA</strong>&nbsp;to a daily chart, it would show you the average movement for the past 20 days.</p>
    <p>There are other types of moving averages such as exponential and weighted, but for the purpose of this lesson, we won&rsquo;t go too much into detail on them.</p>
    <p>For more information on moving averages or if you just need to refresh yourself on them, check out our lesson on moving averages.</p>

    <h2>2. Bollinger Bands</h2>
    <p><strong>Bollinger Bands</strong>&nbsp;are excellent tools for measuring volatility because that is exactly what it was designed to do.</p>
    <p>Bollinger Bands are basically 2 lines that are plotted 2 standard deviations above and below a moving average for an X amount of time, where X is whatever you want it to be.</p>
    <p>So if we set it at 20, we would have a 20 SMA and two other lines.</p>
    <p>One line would be plotted +2 standard deviations above it and the other line would be plotted -2 standard deviations below.</p>
    <p>When the bands c<strong>ontract</strong>, it tells us that volatility is LOW.</p>
    <p>When the bands&nbsp;<strong>widen</strong>, it tells us that volatility is HIGH.</p>
    <p>For a more thorough explanation, check out our Bollinger Bands lesson.</p>

    <h2>3. Average True Range (ATR)</h2>
    <p>Last on the list is the&nbsp;<strong>Average True Range</strong>, also known as ATR.</p>
    <p>The ATR is an excellent tool for measuring volatility because it tells us the average trading range of the market for X amount of time, where X is whatever you want it to be.</p>
    <p>Basically, ATR takes the currency pair&rsquo;s&nbsp;<strong>range</strong>, which is the distance between the high and low in the time frame under study, and then plots that measurement as a moving average</p>
    <p>So if you set ATR to &ldquo;<strong>20</strong>&rdquo; on a daily chart, it would show you the average trading range for the&nbsp;<strong>past 20 days</strong>.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade13-average-true-range2.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>When ATR is&nbsp;<strong>falling</strong>, it is an indication that volatility is decreasing.</p>
    <p>When ATR is&nbsp;<strong>rising,</strong>&nbsp;it is an indication that volatility has been on the rise.</p>
    <p>Just remember that that ATR is a<strong>&nbsp;volatility indicator</strong>, NOT a directional indicator.</p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s s best used as a technical indicator to help confirm the market&rsquo;s enthusiasm (or lack of) for range breakouts.</p>
