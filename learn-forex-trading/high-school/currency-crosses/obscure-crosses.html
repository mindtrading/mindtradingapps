    <p>While the euro and yen crosses are the most liquid crosses, more currency crosses exist that don&rsquo;t even include the U.S. dollar, euro, or the yen!</p>
    <p>We&rsquo;ll call these the &ldquo;Obscure Currency Crosses&rdquo;!</p>
    <p>If we were in school &ndash; come to think of it, we actually are in school! &ndash; the major pairs would be the jocks while the obscure currency crosses would be the eccentric emo kids or&nbsp;hipsters.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade15-emo-boy-girl.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>That&rsquo;s because most forex traders would rather hang out with the cool crowd than the obscure crosses!</p>
    <p>We&rsquo;re talking about really weird combinations like&nbsp;<strong>AUD/CHF</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>AUD/NZD</strong>,<strong>&nbsp;CAD/CHF</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>GBP/CHF</strong>. That&rsquo;s why we call them obscure crosses.</p>
    <p>Trading in these pairs can be more difficult and riskier than trading euro or yen currency crosses.</p>
    <p>Since very few forex traders trade them, transaction volume is much lower resulting in lower&nbsp;<strong>liquidity</strong>.</p>
    <p>Due to the illiquid markets for these crosses, their prices can become quite&nbsp;<strong>volatile</strong>, so being stopped out on whipsaws can become a common occurrence.</p>
    <p>Check out these screenshots of AUD/CHF and GBP/CHF:</p>

    <p>You don&rsquo;t want to get stopped out by those nasty spikes, do you? That&rsquo;s why most forex traders usually put wider stops when trading these pairs.</p>
    <p>But judging from the choppy movement of obscure crosses, it would really be tough to catch a good trade on these pairs.</p>

    <p>See what we mean?</p>
    <p>Also, since these currency cross pairs aren&rsquo;t traded too much by forex traders, the spreads on these pairs can be pretty wide.</p>
    <p>If you want to trade these currency crosses, just be ready for some wild price swings and be willing to pay the price of the massive spread!</p>
