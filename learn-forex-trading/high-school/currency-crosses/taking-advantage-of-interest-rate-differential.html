    <p>By selling currencies whose country has a lower interest rate against currencies whose country has a higher interest rate, you can profit from the&nbsp;<strong>interest rate differential</strong>&nbsp;(known as a carry trade) as well as price appreciation.</p>
    <p>That&rsquo;s like being able to get a frosted cupcake with sprinkles on top! That talks to you! Imagine how delicious that would taste!</p>

    <p>Currency crosses offer many pairs with&nbsp;<strong>high interest rate differentials</strong>&nbsp;that are prime for these types of trades.</p>

    <p>For example, take a look at the nice uptrend on AUD/JPY. If you had a long position on this pair, you would&rsquo;ve made a hefty profit.</p>
    <p>On top of that, the interest rate differential between AUD and JPY was huge.</p>
    <p>From 2002 to 2007, the Reserve Bank of Australia had raised rates to 6.25% while the BOJ kept their rates at&nbsp;<strong>0%</strong>.</p>
    <p>That means you made profits off your long position AND the interest rate differential on that trade!</p>
    <p>Now that&rsquo;d be an awesome cash cow right there!</p>

    <p>Later on in college (if your brain hasn&rsquo;t exploded with all this forex knowledge by then), we&rsquo;ll teach you more about carry trade.</p>
    <p>We&rsquo;ll teach you which ones will work and which ones won&rsquo;t.</p>
    <p>We&rsquo;ll even teach you about a lil&rsquo; something called&nbsp;<strong>risk aversion</strong>. But that&rsquo;s for a later lesson.</p>
