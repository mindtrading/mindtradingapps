    <p>If strong economic data comes out of Australia, you might want to look at buying the AUD. Your first reaction might be to buy&nbsp;<strong>AUD/USD</strong>.</p>
    <p>But what if at the same time, recent data also show the United States experiencing strong economic growth? The price action&nbsp;of AUD/USD may be flat.</p>
    <p>One option that you have is to match the AUD against the currency of an economy that isn&rsquo;t doing so well&hellip;</p>
    <p>Hmmm&hellip; what could you do?</p>
    <p>Ah! Thank the forex gods for currency crosses!</p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s say you did some analysis, checked the BabyPips.com economic calendar (shameless plug!) and you notice that the Japanese economy isn&rsquo;t doing so good right now.</p>
    <p>What do you do?</p>
    <p>Of course, like any self-respecting bully, you jump all over this opportunity and go long&nbsp;<strong>AUD/JPY</strong>!</p>

    <p>In the chart above, notice the&nbsp;<strong>relative strength</strong>&nbsp;of AUD/JPY vs. AUD/USD.</p>
    <p>You&rsquo;re not limited to just these currency pairs, you could&rsquo;ve compared AUD against like EUR, GBP, and CAD.</p>
    <p>From there, you can look for the&nbsp;<em>weakest&nbsp;</em>currency to trade against.</p>
    <p>There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with being a bully, at least not here at the School of Pipsology.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade15-bully.png"  /></p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s your job as a forex trader to take advantage of certain opportunities so that you can put some silver dollars into your piggy bank.</p>
    <p>Because of currency crosses, you now have the opportunity to match the currency of the best-performing economy against that of the weakest economy without having to deal with the U.S. dollar.</p>
