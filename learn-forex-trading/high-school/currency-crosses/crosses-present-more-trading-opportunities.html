    <p>Over&nbsp;<strong>80% of the transactions</strong>&nbsp;in the forex market involve the U.S. dollar.</p>
    <p>This is because the U.S. dollar is the&nbsp;<strong>reserve currency in the world</strong>.</p>
    <p>You may be asking yourself, &ldquo;Why the U.S. dollar and not the sterling, or euro?&rdquo;</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2010/11/strong-dollar.png" /><strong>Most agricultural and commodities such as oil are priced in U.S. dollars.</strong></p>
    <p>If a country needs to purchase oil or other agricultural goods, it first has to change its currency into U.S. dollars before being able to buy the goods.</p>
    <p>This is why many countries keep a reserve of U.S. dollars on hand. They can make purchases much faster with Greenbacks already in their pocket.</p>
    <p>Countries such as China, Japan, and Australia are examples of heavy importers of oil, and as a result, they keep huge reserves of U.S. dollars in their central banks.</p>
    <p>In fact, China has over&nbsp;<strong>3&nbsp;trillion U.S. dollars</strong>&nbsp;in its reserve stockpile! Japan and Switzerland hold over&nbsp;<strong>1 trillion</strong>&nbsp;each!</p>
    <p>So what does this all have to do with trading currency crosses? Well since most of the world is glued to the U.S. dollar, a majority of trading speculation will be based on one question:</p>
    <p><strong>&ldquo;Is the U.S. dollar weak or strong today?&rdquo;</strong></p>
    <p>This one question will affect many of the most liquid currency pairs:</p>
    <p><strong>The majors</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>GBP/USD</li>
    <li>EUR/USD</li>
    <li>USD/CHF</li>
    <li>USD/JPY</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>The commodity pairs:</strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li>AUD/USD</li>
    <li>USD/CAD</li>
    <li>NZD/USD</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Notice that all of these pairs are tied to the U.S. dollar.</p>
    <p>This doesn&rsquo;t give a trader many options when most of their trading decisions are based on this one speculation.</p>
    <p><img title="Non Currency Crosses" src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade15-usd-vs-major-currencies.png" /></p>
    <p>You can see that by trading any of the 7 most popular currencies, you are basically taking either an anti-U.S. dollar or pro-U.S. dollar stance.</p>
    <p>This one speculation affects these pairs in almost the same way across the board.</p>
    <p>Conversely, in the stock market, traders have multiple companies to choose from and are not bound to one major speculation idea.</p>
    <p><img title="2009 Performance of DJIA companies" src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade15-djia-2009-2.png" /></p>
    <p>With stocks, you can see that even though the overall market was positive, there are still plenty of other trading opportunities.</p>
    <p>There isn&rsquo;t just one kind of speculation that affects the entire basket of stocks.</p>
    <h2>Currency Crosses Provide More Trading Opportunities</h2>
    <p>Instead of just looking at the seven &ldquo;major&rdquo; dollar-based pairs, currency crosses provide more currency pairs for you to find profitable opportunities!</p>
    <p>By trading currency crosses, you give yourself more options for trading opportunities because these currencies are not bound to the U.S. dollar, thus possibly having different price movement behaviors.</p>
    <p>So while the majority of the markets will only trade on anti-U.S. dollar or pro-U.S. dollar sentiments, you can find new opportunities in currency crosses.</p>
    <p>For example, all the dollar-based pairs might be trading sideways or in some uglier fashion where it would be smart to just SIT<strong>&nbsp;on the sidelines and WAIT</strong>&nbsp;for better trade setups</p>
    <p>But if you knew to switch your charts to look at currency crosses, you might just find trading opportunities galore!</p>
    <p>Be different! The majority of traders just trade the majors.</p>
    <p>Now you can be part of the minority that trade&nbsp;currency&nbsp;crosses.</p>
