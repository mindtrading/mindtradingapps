    <p>Since a majority of the forex market will deal with the U.S. dollar, you can imagine that many of the news reports will cause U.S. dollar-based currency pairs to spike.</p>
    <p>The U.S. has the largest economy in the world, and as a result, speculators react strongly to U.S. news reports, even if it doesn&rsquo;t cause a huge fundamental shift in the long run.</p>
    <p>What this means for your charts is that you will see several &ldquo;spikes&rdquo; even if there is a trend emerging. This can make it harder to spot trends or range conditions.</p>

    <p>The day-to-day economic activities of the U.S. can keep U.S. dollar-based currencies such as EUR/USD (above) from making smooth trends.</p>

    <p>Conversely, we can see that during the same date range, cross currency EUR/JPY made a much, much smoother ride to the top.</p>
    <p>This was probably due to fewer spikes that came from U.S. data.</p>
    <p>So as you can see, both charts showed the euro rose during the same time period, but the one without the U.S. dollar (EUR/JPY) made for much easier trade.</p>
    <p>Here&rsquo;s a trade example where one hundred pips was bagged riding EUR/JPY&rsquo;s trend. Check out how he caught that move!</p>
    <p>If you are a trend-following kinda dude, then currency crosses may be easier to trade than the major pairs.</p>
    <p>It will be easier for you to spot the trend and be more confident in your entry points because you know that&nbsp;these technical levels hold more than they do for the majors.</p>
    <p>In the next section, we&rsquo;ll discuss how playing with currency crosses can also allow you to take advantage of the interest rate differentials. Now that&rsquo;s like a cherry on top of a sundae!</p>
