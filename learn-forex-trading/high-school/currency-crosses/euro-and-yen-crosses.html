    <p>After the U.S. dollar, the euro and yen are the most traded currencies.</p>
    <p>And like the U.S. dollar, the euro and yen are also held as&nbsp;<strong>reserve currencies</strong>&nbsp;by different countries.</p>
    <p>So this makes the euro and yen crosses the most liquid outside of the U.S. dollar-based &ldquo;majors.&rdquo;</p>
    <h2>Trading the Euro Crosses</h2>
    <p>The most popular EUR crosses are&nbsp;<strong>EUR/JPY</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>EUR/GBP</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>EUR/CHF</strong>.</p>
    <p>News that affects the euro or Swiss franc will be felt more in EUR crosses than EUR/USD or USD/CHF.</p>
    <p>U.K. news will greatly affect EUR/GBP.</p>
    <p>Oddly enough, U.S. news plays a part in the movement of the EUR crosses. U.S. news makes strong moves in GBP/USD and USD/CHF.</p>
    <p>This not only affects the price of the GBP and CHF against the USD, but it could also affect the GBP and CHF against the EUR.</p>
    <p>A big move higher in the USD will tend to see a higher EUR/CHF and EUR/GBP and the same goes for the opposite direction.</p>
    <p>Confused? Ok ok&hellip;let&rsquo;s break this down.</p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s say that the U.S. shows positive economic data causing the USD to rise.</p>
    <p>This means that GBP/USD would fall, driving the price of the GBP down. At the same time, USD/CHF would rise, also driving the price of the CHF down.</p>
    <p>The drop in GBP price would then cause EUR/GBP to rise (since traders are selling off their GBP).</p>
    <p>The drop in CHF price would also cause EUR/CHF to rise (since traders are selling off their CHF).</p>
    <p>Conversely, this would also work in the opposite direction if the U.S. showed negative economic data.</p>
    <h2>Trading the Yen Crosses</h2>
    <p>The JPY is one of the more popular cross currencies and it is basically traded against all of the other major currencies.</p>
    <p><strong>EUR/JPY</strong>&nbsp;has the highest volume of the JPY crosses according to the latest&nbsp;Triennial Central Bank Survey&nbsp;from the Bank for International Settlements.</p>
    <p><strong>GBP/JPY</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>AUD/JPY</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>NZD/JPY</strong>&nbsp;are attractive carry trade currencies because they offer the highest interest rate differentials against the JPY.</p>
    <p>When trading JPY currency cross pairs, you should always keep an eye out for the USD/JPY.</p>
    <p>When key levels are broken or resisted on this pair, it tends to spill over into the JPY cross pairs.</p>
    <p>For example, if USD/JPY breaks out above a key resistance area, it means that traders are selling off their JPY.</p>
    <p>This could prompt the selling of the JPY against other currencies. Therefore you could expect to see EUR/JPY, GBP/JPY,&nbsp;and other JPY crosses rise as well.</p>
    <h2>The CAD/JPY</h2>
    <p>Over recent years, this currency cross has become very popular, becoming highly correlated with the price of oil.</p>
    <p>Canada is the second-largest owner of oil reserves and has benefited from the rise of oil prices.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, Japan is heavily reliant on the importing of oil. In fact, over&nbsp;<strong>99%</strong>&nbsp;of Japan&rsquo;s crude oil is imported as it has almost no native oil reserves.</p>
    <p>These two factors have caused an 87% positive correlation between the price of oil and CAD/JPY.</p>
