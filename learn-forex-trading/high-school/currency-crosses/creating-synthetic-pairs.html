    <p>Sometimes institutional forex traders can&rsquo;t trade certain currency crosses because they trade in such large sizes that there isn&rsquo;t enough liquidity to execute their order.</p>
    <p>In order to execute their desired trade, they have to create a &ldquo;<strong>synthetic pair</strong>&ldquo;.</p>
    <h2>How to Create a Synthetic Currency Pair</h2>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s say that an institutional forex trader wants to buy GBP/JPY but can&rsquo;t because there isn&rsquo;t enough liquidity.</p>
    <p>To execute this trade, they would have to buy both GBP/USD and USD/JPY (earlier in this lesson, we learned that these pairs are called its&nbsp;<strong>legs</strong>).</p>
    <p>They are able to do this because there is plenty of liquidity in&nbsp;<strong>GBP/USD</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>USD/JPY</strong>&nbsp;which means they can make large orders.</p>
    <p><img title="Synthetic Currency Pair" src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade15-gbjpy-synthetic.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>If you&rsquo;re a retail forex trader, and you wanted to pretend to trade like an institutional trader, then you could technically trade synthetic currency pairs as well.</p>
    <p>But it wouldn&rsquo;t be too smart.</p>
    <p>Ever since the great Al Gore &ldquo;invented the internet,&rdquo; technology has improved to the point now that even weird currency crosses like&nbsp;<strong>GBP/NZD</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>CHF/JPY</strong>&nbsp;can now be traded on your forex broker&rsquo;s platform.</p>
    <p>Aside from having access to a larger &ldquo;menu&rdquo; of currency pairs to trade, the spreads would be tighter on the crosses compared to the synthetic pair you&rsquo;d create.</p>
    <p>And let&rsquo;s not forgot about&nbsp;<strong>margin use!</strong></p>
    <p>Creating a synthetic currency pair requires you to open two separate positions and each position requires its own margin.</p>
    <p>This&nbsp;<strong>locks up unnecessary capital</strong>&nbsp;in your trading account when you can simply trade the cross-currency and save on&nbsp;margin.</p>
    <p>So unless you&rsquo;re trading&nbsp;<strong>yards</strong>&nbsp;(forex slang term for one BILLION units), forget synthetic currency pairs and stick to currency crosses.</p>
    <p>You will be saving yourself some pips (thanks to a tighter spread) as well as freeing up your capital so you can take on more trades.</p>
