    <p>Whenever Happy Pip goes swimming at the beach or the pool, she always wears her pink rubber ducky floaters.</p>
    <p>Whenever she trades retracements, she uses stop loss points.</p>
    <p>Pink rubber ducky floaters are&nbsp;<strong>lifesavers</strong>. Stop loss points are&nbsp;<strong>capital savers</strong>.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade12-floaties.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>As we said before,&nbsp;<strong>reversals can happen at any time</strong>. Retracements can&nbsp;<em>turn</em>&nbsp;into reversals without warning.</p>
    <p>This makes using trailing stops in trending markets very important.</p>
    <p>With trailing stop loss points, you can effectively prevent yourself from exiting a position too early during a retracement and exit a reversal in a pinch.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>You don&rsquo;t have to be shot down by the &ldquo;Smooth Retracement&rdquo;. You don&rsquo;t have to lose all those pips.</p>
    <p>And you most certainly don&rsquo;t need to wear pink arm floaties (although if pink&rsquo;s your favorite color, it&rsquo;s okay &ndash; we don&rsquo;t judge).</p>
    <p>Just know&nbsp;<strong>how to distinguish retracements from reversals</strong>.</p>
    <p>This is part of growing up as a trader. Having the ability to do so will effectively reduce your losses and prevent winners from turning into losers.</p>
    <p>With lots of practice and experience, you&rsquo;ll find yourself being able to trade accordingly to retracements and exit with a profit more times than not.</p>
