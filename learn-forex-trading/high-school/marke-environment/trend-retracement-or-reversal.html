    <p>Imagine this scenario. Price starts to rise. Keeps rising. Then it starts falling.</p>
    <p>And falling some more.</p>
    <p>And falling some more.</p>
    <p>And then it starts going back up!</p>
    <p>Have you ever been in this situation before?</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade12-retracement-or-reversal2.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>It looks as though price action may be rallying and a buy trade is in order.</p>
    <p><strong>WRONG!</strong></p>

    <p>You&rsquo;ve been hit by the &ldquo;Smooth Retracement!&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Nobody likes to be hit by the &ldquo;Smooth Retracement&rdquo; but, sadly, it does happen.</p>
    <p>Why?</p>
    <p>In the above example, the forex trader failed to recognize the difference between a&nbsp;<strong>retracement</strong>&nbsp;and a&nbsp;<strong>reversal</strong>.</p>
    <p>Instead of being patient and riding the overall downtrend, the trader believed that a reversal was in motion and set a long entry. Whoops, there goes his money!</p>
    <p>Check out how Happy Pip got fooled by the &ldquo;Smooth Retracement&rdquo; in one of her AUD/USD trades.</p>
    <p>In this lesson, you will learn the characteristics of retracements and reversals, how to recognize them, and how to protect yourself from false signals.</p>
    <h2>What are Trend Retracements?</h2>
    <p>A&nbsp;<strong>retracement</strong>&nbsp;is defined as a temporary price movement against the established trend.</p>
    <p>Another way to look at it is an area of price movement that moves against the trend but returns to continue the trend.</p>

    <p>Easy enough? Let&rsquo;s move on&hellip;</p>
    <h2>What are Trend Reversals?</h2>
    <p><strong>Reversals</strong>&nbsp;are defined as a change in the overall trend of price.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>When an&nbsp;<strong>uptrend switches to a downtrend</strong>, a reversal occurs.</li>
    <li>When a&nbsp;<strong>downtrend switches to an uptrend</strong>, a reversal also occurs.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Using the same example as above, here&rsquo;s how a reversal looks like.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade12-reversal.png" alt="" /></p>
    <h3>What Should You Do?</h3>
    <p>When faced with a possible retracement or reversal, you have three options:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>If in a position you could&nbsp;<strong>hold</strong>&nbsp;onto your position. This could lead to losses if the retracement turns out to be a longer-term reversal.</li>
    <li>You could&nbsp;<strong>close your position</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>re-enter</strong>&nbsp;if the price starts moving with the overall trend again. Of course, there could be a missed trade opportunity if the price sharply moves in one direction. Money is also wasted on spreads if you decide to re-enter.</li>
    <li>You could&nbsp;<strong>close permanently</strong>. This could result in a loss (if the price went against you) or a huge profit (if you closed at a top or bottom) depending on the structure of your trade and what happens after.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Because reversals can happen at any time, choosing the best option isn&rsquo;t always easy.</p>
    <p>This is why using<strong>&nbsp;trailing stop loss points</strong>&nbsp;can be a great risk management technique when trading with the trend.</p>
    <p>You can employ it to protect your profits and make sure that you will always walk away with some pips in the event that a long-term reversal happens.</p>
