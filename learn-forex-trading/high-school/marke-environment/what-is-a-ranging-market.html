    <p>What is a range-bound market?</p>
    <p>A&nbsp;<strong>range-bound</strong>&nbsp;market is one in which price bounces between a specific high price and a low price.</p>
    <p>The high price acts as a major resistance level in which price can&rsquo;t seem to break through.</p>
    <p>Likewise, the low price acts as a major support level in which price can&rsquo;t seem to break as well.</p>
    <p>The market movement could be classified as&nbsp;<strong>horizontal, ranging, or sideways</strong>.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade12-market-ranging.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s also known as a &ldquo;<strong>choppy market</strong>&rdquo; or simply as &ldquo;<strong>being choppy</strong>&ldquo;.</p>
    <p>A&nbsp;<strong>choppy market</strong>&nbsp;is the opposite of a trending market. Kind of like choppy waves in the ocean.</p>
    <p>In a choppy market,&nbsp;<strong>there is no clear direction</strong>, and the price just &ldquo;<strong>chops around</strong>&rdquo; or &ldquo;<strong>chops up and down</strong>&rdquo; and trades within a very narrow range.</p>
    <p>Trend traders tend to get &ldquo;chopped up&rdquo; in choppy markets.</p>
    <p>What is the favorite food of a range-bound trader?</p>
    <p>Chop suey.&nbsp;ðŸ˜‚</p>
    <p>Okay, let&rsquo;s get back on topic. Chop chop!</p>
    <h2>ADX in a Ranging Market</h2>
    <p>One way to determine if the market is ranging is to use the same ADX&nbsp;as discussed in the ADX lesson.</p>
    <p>A market is said to be ranging when the ADX is&nbsp;<strong>below 25</strong>.</p>
    <p>Remember, as the value of the ADX diminishes, the weaker trend is.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade12-ADX-range.png" alt="" /></p>
    <h2>Bollinger Bands in a Ranging Market</h2>
    <p>In essence, Bollinger Bands contract when there is less volatility&nbsp;in the market and expands when there is more volatility.</p>
    <p>Because of that, Bollinger Bands provide a good tool for breakout strategies.</p>
    <p>When the&nbsp;<strong>bands are thin and contracted</strong>, volatility is low and there should be little movement of price in one direction.</p>
    <p>However, when&nbsp;<strong>bands start to expand</strong>, volatility is increasing and more movement of price in one direction is likely.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade12-bollinger-bands-range.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>Generally, range trading environments will contain somewhat narrow bands compared to wide bands and form horizontally.</p>
    <p>In this case, we can see that the Bollinger Bands are contracted, as the price is just moving within a tight range.</p>
    <p><strong>The basic idea of a range-bound strategy is that a currency pair has a high and low price that it normally trades between.</strong></p>
    <p>By buying near the low price, the forex trader is hoping to take profit around the high price.</p>
    <p>By selling near the high price, the trader is hoping to take profit around the low price.</p>
    <p>Popular tools to use are channels such as the one shown above and Bollinger Bands.</p>
    <p>Using oscillators, like Stochastic or RSI, will help increase the odds of you finding a turning point in a range as they can identify potentially oversold and overbought conditions.</p>
    <p>Here&rsquo;s an example using&nbsp;<strong>GBP/USD</strong>.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade12-stochastic-range.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p><strong>Bonus Tip:</strong>&nbsp;The best pairs for trading range-bound strategies are&nbsp;<strong>currency crosses</strong>. By crosses, we mean those pairs that do not include the USD as one of the currencies in the pair.</p>
    <p>One of the most well-known currency pairs for trading ranges is&nbsp;<strong>EUR/CHF</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The similar growth rates shared by the European Union and Switzerland pretty much keep the exchange rate of the EUR/CHF stable.</p>
    <p>Another pair is&nbsp;<strong>AUD/NZD</strong>.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Whether you&rsquo;re trading a pair that&rsquo;s in a trending or ranging environment, you should take comfort in knowing that you can profit whatever the case may be.</p>
    <p>Find out how you can pick tops and bottoms in both trending and ranging market environments.</p>
    <p>By knowing what a trending environment and a range-bound environment are and what they look like, you&rsquo;ll be able to employ a specific strategy for each.</p>
