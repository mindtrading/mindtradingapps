    <p>Properly distinguishing&nbsp;<strong>between retracements and reversals</strong>&nbsp;can reduce the number of losing trades and even set you up with some winning trades.</p>
    <p>Classifying a price movement as a&nbsp;<strong>retracement or a reversal</strong>&nbsp;is very important. It&rsquo;s up there with paying taxes. *cough*</p>
    <p>There are several key differences in distinguishing a temporary price change retracement from a long-term trend reversal.</p>
    <p>Here they are:</p>
    <div>
    <div>
    <table border="1px" width="100%">
    <tbody>
    <tr>
    <th>RETRACEMENTS</th>
    <th>REVERSALS</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Usually occurs after&nbsp;<strong>huge</strong>&nbsp;directional price movements.</td>
    <td>Can occur at&nbsp;<strong>any time</strong>.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><strong>Short-term</strong>, short-lived reversal.</td>
    <td><strong>Long-term</strong>&nbsp;price movement</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Fundamentals (i.e., the macroeconomic environment)&nbsp;<strong>do NOT</strong>&nbsp;change.</td>
    <td>Fundamentals&nbsp;<strong>DO</strong>&nbsp;change, which is usually the catalyst for the long-term reversal.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>In an&nbsp;<strong>uptrend</strong>, buying interest is present, making it likely for the price to rally. In a&nbsp;<strong>downtrend</strong>, selling interest is present, making it likely for the price to decline.</td>
    <td>In an&nbsp;<strong>uptrend</strong>, there is very little buying interest forcing the price to fall lower. In a&nbsp;<strong>downtrend</strong>, there is very little selling interest forcing the price to rise further.</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>
    </div>

    <h2>Identifying Retracements</h2>
    <h3>Method #1: Fibonacci Retracement</h3>
    <p>A popular way to identify retracements is to use Fibonacci levels.</p>
    <p>For the most part, price retracements hang around the 38.2%, 50.0% and 61.8% Fibonacci retracement levels before&nbsp;continuing the overall trend.</p>
    <p>If the price goes beyond these levels, it may signal that a reversal is happening. Notice how we didn&rsquo;t say will.</p>
    <p>As you may have figured out by now, technical analysis isn&rsquo;t an exact science, which means nothing certain, especially in forex markets.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade12-retracement-fibonacci.png" /></p>
    <p>In this case, the price took a breather and rested at the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level before resuming the uptrend.</p>
    <p>After a while, it pulled back again and settled at the 50% retracement level before heading higher.</p>
    <h3>Method #2: Pivot Points</h3>
    <p>Another way to see if the price is staging a reversal is to use&nbsp;<strong>pivot points</strong>.</p>
    <p>In an UPTREND, traders will look at the lower support points (S1, S2, S3) and wait for it to break.</p>
    <p>In a DOWNTREND, forex traders will look at the higher resistance points (R1, R2, R3) and wait for it to break.</p>
    <p>If broken, a reversal could be in the making! For more information or another refresher, check out the Pivot Points lesson!</p>

    <h3>Method #3: Trend Lines</h3>
    <p>The last method is to use&nbsp;<strong>trend lines.</strong>&nbsp;When a major trend line is broken, a reversal may be in effect.</p>
    <p>By using this technical tool in conjunction with candlestick chart patterns discussed earlier, a forex trader may be able to get a high probability of a reversal.</p>

    <p>While these methods can identify reversals, they aren&rsquo;t the only way. At the end of the day, nothing can substitute for&nbsp;<strong>practice and experience</strong>.</p>
    <p>With enough screen time, you can find a method that suits your forex trading personality in identifying retracements and reversals.</p>
