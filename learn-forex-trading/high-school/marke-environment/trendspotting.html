    <p>When two people go to war, the foolish man always rushes blindly into battle without a plan, much like a starving man at his favorite buffet spot.</p>
    <p>The wise man, on the other hand, will always get a situation report first to know the surrounding conditions that could affect how the battle plays out.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade12-binoculars.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>Like in warfare, we must also get a situation report on the trading environment. This means we need to know&nbsp;<strong>what kind of market environment we are actually in</strong>.</p>
    <p>Some forex traders cry saying that their system sucks.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2010/12/system-sucks.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>Sometimes the system does in fact&hellip;suck.</p>
    <p>Other times, the system is potentially profitable, but it is being utilized in the wrong trading environment.</p>
    <p>Seasoned forex traders try to figure out the appropriate strategy for the current market environment they are trading in.</p>
    <p>Is it time to bust out those Fibs and look for retracements? Or are ranges holding?</p>
    <p>Just as the coach comes up with different plays for particular situations or opponents, you should also be able to decide which strategy to use depending on the trading&nbsp;environment.</p>
    <p>By knowing what market environment we are trading in, we can choose a&nbsp;<strong>trend-based strategy</strong>&nbsp;in a trending market or a&nbsp;<strong>range-bound strategy</strong>&nbsp;in a ranging market.</p>
    <p>Are you worried about not getting to use your beastly range-bound strategy? How about your Bring-Home-Da-Bacon trend-based system?</p>
    <p>Have no fear!</p>
    <p>The forex market&nbsp;provides many trending and ranging opportunities across different time frames wherein these strategies can be implemented.</p>
    <p>By knowing which strategies are appropriate, you will find it easier to figure out which indicators to pull out from your forex toolbox.</p>
    <p>For instance, Fibs and trend lines are useful in trending markets while pivot points, support and resistance levels are helpful when the market is ranging.</p>
    <p>Before spotting those opportunities, you have to be able to determine the trading&nbsp;environment.</p>
    <p>The state of the market can be classified into three scenarios:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Trending up</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Trending down</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Ranging</strong></li>
    </ul>
