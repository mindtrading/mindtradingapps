    <p><strong>Multiple. Time. Frame. Analysis.</strong></p>
    <p>Multi-time frame ana&hellip; WHAT?!</p>
    <p>What is&nbsp;<strong>multiple time frame analysis</strong>?</p>
    <p>Chill out young padawan, it ain&rsquo;t as complicated as it sounds!</p>
    <p>You&rsquo;re almost done with high school!</p>
    <p>Now&rsquo;s not the time to get senioritis, although you probably got that way back in Grade 12. Ha!</p>
    <p><img title="Multiple Time Frame Analysis Man" src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade16-timekeeper.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p><strong>Multiple time frame analysis</strong>&nbsp;is simply the process of looking at the same pair and the same price&nbsp;<em>but on different time frames</em>.</p>
    <p>Remember, a pair exists on several time frames &ndash; the&nbsp;<strong>daily</strong>, the&nbsp;<strong>hourly</strong>, the&nbsp;<strong>15-minute</strong>, heck, even the&nbsp;<strong>1-minute</strong>!</p>
    <p>When you use a chart, you&rsquo;ll notice that there are different time frames being provided.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2010/11/23151126/chart-timeframes-780x711.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>The current chart above is the &ldquo;1 day&rdquo; or&nbsp;<strong>daily time frame</strong>.</p>
    <p>When you click on the &ldquo;1 hour&rdquo;, it will bring out the 1-hour chart. If you click on &ldquo;5 minutes&rdquo;, it will bring out the 5-minute chart and so on.</p>
    <p>There is a reason why chart apps offer so many time frames. It&rsquo;s because there are different market participants in the market.</p>
    <p>This means that different forex traders can have their different opinions on how a pair is trading and both can be completely correct.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2010/11/multile-time-frame-analysis-fractal.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>Some will be traders who will focus on 10-minute charts while others will focus on the weekly charts.</p>
    <p>John&nbsp;may see that EUR/USD is on a downtrend on the 4-hour chart.</p>
    <p>However, Jane&nbsp;trades on the 5-minute chart and sees that the pair just ranging up and down. And they could both be correct!</p>
    <p>As you can see, this poses a problem.</p>
    <p>Trades sometimes get confused when they look at the 4-hour, see that a sell signal, then they hop on the 1-hour and see price slowly moving up.</p>
    <p>What are you supposed to do?</p>
    <p>A. Stick with one time frame, take the signal, and completely ignore the other time frame?</p>
    <p>B. Flip a coin to decide whether you should buy or sell?</p>
    <p>Both options are terrible.</p>
    <p>So what are the benefits of looking at multiple time frames?</p>
    <ol>
    <li>They give you different perspectives and views of a currency pair.</li>
    <li>They enable you to spot upcoming support or resistance areas.</li>
    <li>They enable you to spot trend changes earlier.</li>
    <li>They help you to enter or exit a trade as early as possible.</li>
    <li>They help to confirm the trend change in a higher time frame.</li>
    <li>They allow you to know what other market participants are thinking.</li>
    <li>They enable you to see the small picture, medium picture, and the big picture.</li>
    </ol>
