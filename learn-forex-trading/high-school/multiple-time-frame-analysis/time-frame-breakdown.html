    <p>What time frame is best for trading?</p>
    <p>Well, just like everything in life, it all depends on YOU.</p>
    <p>Do you like to take things slowly, take your time on each trade?</p>
    <p>Maybe you&rsquo;re suited for trading longer time frames.</p>
    <p>Or perhaps you like the excitement, quick, fast-paced action?</p>
    <p>Perhaps you should take a look at the 5-min charts.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2010/11/23153309/self-awareness.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>In the table below, we&rsquo;ve highlighted some of the basic time frames and the differences between each.</p>
    <div>
    <div>
    <table border="1px">
    <tbody>
    <tr>
    <th>TIME FRAME</th>
    <th>DESCRIPTION</th>
    <th>ADVANTAGE</th>
    <th>DISADVANTAGES</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <th>LONG-TERM</th>
    <td>Long-term traders will usually refer to&nbsp;<strong>daily and weekly charts</strong>.
    <p>The weekly charts will establish a longer-term perspective and assist in placing entries in the shorter term daily.</p>
    <p>Trades usually from a few weeks to many months, sometimes years.</p>
    </td>
    <td>Don&rsquo;t have to watch the markets intraday.
    <p>Fewer transactions mean fewer times to pay the spread.</p>
    <p>More time to think through each trade</p>
    </td>
    <td>Large swingsUsually 1 or 2 two goods a year so PATIENCE is required.
    <p>Bigger account needed to ride longer-term swings</p>
    <p>Frequent losing months</p>
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <th>SHORT-TERM (SWING)</th>
    <td>Short-term traders use hourly time frames and hold trades for&nbsp;<strong>several hours to a week</strong>.</td>
    <td>More opportunities for trades.
    <p>Less chance of losing months.</p>
    <p>Less reliance on one or two trades a year to make money</p>
    </td>
    <td>Transaction costs will be higher (more spreads to pay).
    <p>Overnight risk becomes a factor</p>
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <th>INTRADAY</th>
    <td>Intraday traders use&nbsp;<strong>minute charts</strong>&nbsp;such as 1-minute or 15-minute.
    <p>Trades are held intraday and exited by market close.</p>
    </td>
    <td>Lots of trading opportunities.
    <p>Less chance of losing months overnight risk</p>
    </td>
    <td>Transaction costs will be much higher (more spreads to pay).
    <p>Mentally more difficult due to the need to change biases frequently.</p>
    <p>Profits are limited by needing to exit at the end of the day.</p>
    </td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>You also have to consider the amount of capital you have to trade.</p>
    <p>Shorter time frames allow you to make better use of margin and have tighter stop losses.</p>
    <p><strong>Larger time frames require bigger stops</strong>, thus a bigger account, so you can handle the market swings without facing a margin call.</p>
    <p>The most important thing to remember is that whatever time frame you choose to trade, it should naturally&nbsp;<strong>fit your personality.</strong></p>
    <p>If you feel a little uncomfortable like your undies are loose or your pants are a little too short, then maybe it&rsquo;s just not the right fit.</p>
    <p><strong>This is why we suggest demo trading on several time frames for a while to find your comfort zone.</strong></p>
    <p>This will help you determine the best fit for you to make the best trading decisions you can.</p>
    <p>When you finally decide on your preferred time frame, that&rsquo;s when the fun begins!</p>
    <p>This is when you start looking at multiple time frames to help you analyze the market.</p>
