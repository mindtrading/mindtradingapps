    <p>Before we explain how to do multiple time frame analysis for your forex trading,&nbsp;we feel that it&rsquo;s necessary to point out why you should actually flip through the different time frames.</p>
    <p>After all, isn&rsquo;t it hard enough to analyze just one chart as a forex trader?</p>
    <p>You&rsquo;ve got a billion indicators on, you&rsquo;ve gotta read up on economic news, you&rsquo;ve got basketball practice, a Call of Duty session, a Fornite session, a Dota 2 session, a hot date at McDonald&rsquo;s, then an hour of viewing Instagram stories, and another two hours watching TikToks, etc.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2010/11/long-or-short.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>Well, let&rsquo;s play a game called &ldquo;<strong>Long or Short</strong>&rdquo; to show why you should be paying attention and putting in the extra effort to look at different time frames.</p>
    <p>The rules of the game are easy. You look at a chart and you decide whether to go long or short. Easy, right? Okay, ready?</p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at the 10-minute chart of GBP/USD at 8:00 am GMT.</p>
    <p>We&rsquo;ve got the 200-period simple moving average (SMA) on the chart, which appears to be holding as resistance.</p>
    <p>With price testing the resistance and forming a doji, it seems like a good time to short right?</p>
    <p>We&rsquo;ll take that as a yes.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade16-10min-200SMA.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>But dang, look what happens next!</p>
    <p>The pair closed above resistance and rose another 200 pips!</p>
    <p>Ouch! Oh well, too bad!</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade16-10min-200SMA-break.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>What the hell happened? Hmm, let&rsquo;s hop on to the 1-hour chart to see what happened&hellip;</p>
    <p>If you had been looking at the one-hour chart, you would have noticed that the pair was actually at the bottom of the ascending channel.</p>
    <p>What&rsquo;s more, a doji had formed right smack on the support line! A clear buy signal!</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade16-1hour-channel.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>The ascending channel would have been even clearer on the 4-hour chart.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade16-4hour-channel.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>If you had looked at this chart first, would you still have been so quick to go short when you were trading on the 10-minute chart?</p>
    <p>All of the charts were showing the same price data. They were just different time frames of that same data.</p>
    <p>Do you see now the importance of looking at multiple time frames?</p>
    <p>We used to just trade off the 15-minute charts and that was it.</p>
    <p>We could never understand why when everything looked good the market would suddenly stall or reverse.</p>
    <p>It never crossed our minds to take a look at a larger time frame to see what was happening.</p>
    <p><strong>When the market did stall or reverse on the 15-minute chart, it was often because it had hit support or resistance on a larger time frame.</strong></p>
    <p>It took a couple of hundred negative pips to learn that the larger the time frame, the more likely an important support or resistance levels would hold.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2010/11/big-picture.jpg" alt="" /></p>
    <p>Trading using&nbsp;<strong>multiple time frames</strong>&nbsp;has probably kept us out of more losing trades than any other one thing alone.</p>
    <p>It will allow you to stay in a trade longer because you&rsquo;re able to identify where you are relative to the&nbsp;<strong>BIG PICTURE.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Most beginners look at only one time frame.</strong></p>
    <p>They grab a single time frame, apply their indicators, and ignore other time frames.</p>
    <p>The problem is that a new trend, coming from another time frame, often hurts forex traders who don&rsquo;t&nbsp;<strong>look at the big picture</strong>.</p>
