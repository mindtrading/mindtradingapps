    <p>No, we aren&rsquo;t about to break out into song like the Glee cast.</p>
    <p>Here at BabyPips.com, we&rsquo;ve got our version of a mash-up, which we like to call the &ldquo;Time Frame Mash-up&rdquo;.</p>
    <p>This is where&nbsp;<strong>multiple time frame analysis</strong>&nbsp;comes into play.</p>
    <p>This is where we&rsquo;ll teach you how to not only lock in on your preferred trading time frame but zoom in and out of charts so that you can knock a winner out of the park.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade16-mashup.png" alt="" />Are you ready? You sure you can hack this? You&rsquo;ve basically got a semester left of BabyPips.com&rsquo;s School of Pipsology?</p>
    <p>You don&rsquo;t wanna quit now, do you?</p>
    <p>Didn&rsquo;t think so!</p>
    <p>First of all, take a broad look at what&rsquo;s happening.</p>
    <p>Don&rsquo;t try to get your face closer to the market, but push yourself further away.</p>
    <p>You have to remember,&nbsp;<strong>a trend on a longer time frame has had more time to develop, which means that it will take a bigger market move for the pair to change course</strong>.</p>
    <p>Also, support and resistance levels are more significant on longer time frames.</p>
    <p>Start off by selecting your preferred time frame and then go up to the next higher time frame.</p>
    <p>There you can make a strategic decision to go long or short based on whether the market is&nbsp;<strong>ranging or trending</strong>.</p>
    <p>You would then return to your preferred time frame (or even lower!) to make tactical decisions about&nbsp;<strong>where to enter and exit</strong>&nbsp;(place stop and profit target).</p>
    <p>Just so you know, this is probably one of the best uses of multiple time frame analysis&hellip;you can zoom in to help you find better entry and exit points.</p>
    <p>By adding the dimension of time to your analysis, you can obtain an edge over the other tunnel vision traders who trade off on only one time frame.</p>
    <p>Did you get all of that? Well, if you didn&rsquo;t, no worries!</p>
    <p>We&rsquo;re gonna go through an example now to help make things a little clearer.</p>
    <h2>How to Perform Multiple Time Frame Analysis</h2>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2010/11/cinderella.png" alt="" />Let&rsquo;s say that Cinderella, who gets bored all day cleaning up after her evil stepsisters, decides that she wants to trade forex.</p>
    <p>After some demo trading, she realizes that she likes trading the EUR/USD pair the most, and feels most comfortable looking at the 1-hour chart.</p>
    <p>She thinks that the 15-minute charts are too fast while the 4-hour take too long &ndash; after all, she needs her beauty sleep.</p>
    <p>The first thing that Cinderella does is move up to check out the&nbsp;<strong>4-hour chart</strong>&nbsp;of EUR/USD.</p>
    <p>This will help her&nbsp;<strong>determine the overall trend.</strong></p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade16-eurusd-uptrend.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>She sees that the pair is clearly in an&nbsp;<strong>uptrend</strong>.</p>
    <p>This signals to Cinderella that she should ONLY be looking for BUY signals. After all, the trend is her friend, right? She doesn&rsquo;t want to get caught in the wrong direction and lose her slipper.</p>
    <p>Now, she zooms back to her preferred time frame, the&nbsp;<strong>1-hour chart</strong>, to help her spot an entry point. She also decides to pop on the Stochastic indicator.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade16-trendline-doji.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>Once she goes back down to the 1-hour chart, Cinderella sees that a doji candlestick has formed and the Stochastic has just crossed over out of oversold conditions!</p>
    <p>But Cinderella still isn&rsquo;t quite sure&hellip;. she wants to make sure she has a really&nbsp;<strong>good entry point</strong>, so she scales down to the&nbsp;<strong>15-minute chart</strong>&nbsp;to help her find an even&nbsp;<em>better</em>&nbsp;entry and to give her more confirmation.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade16-eurusd-trendline2.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>So now Cinderella is locking her eyes in on the 15-minute chart, and she sees that the trend line seems to be holding pretty strongly.</p>
    <p>Not only that, but Stochastic is showing oversold conditions on the 15-minute time frame as well!</p>
    <p>She figures that this could be a good time to enter and buy.</p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s see what happens next.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade16-eurusd-uptrend-end.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>As it turns out, the uptrend continues, and EUR/USD continues to rise up the charts.</p>
    <p>Cinderella would have entered just above 1.2800 and if she had kept the trade open for a couple of weeks, she would have made 400 pips!</p>
    <p>She could have bought another pair of glass slippers!</p>
    <p>There is obviously a limit to how many time frames you can study. You don&rsquo;t want a screen full of charts telling you different things.</p>
    <p><strong>Use at least TWO, but not more than THREE time frames.</strong></p>
    <p>Adding more will just confuse the geewillikers out of you and you&rsquo;ll suffer from analysis paralysis, then proceed to go crazy.</p>
    <p>Is there a wrong way to do multiple time frame analysis, you ask?</p>
    <p>Some of our forex friends have been nice enough to give their two pips on this matter through this forum thread on multiple time frame analysis.</p>
    <p>At the end of the day, it really is all about finding what works best for you.</p>
