    <p>One of the reasons newbie traders don&rsquo;t do as well as they should is because they&rsquo;re usually trading the&nbsp;<strong>wrong time frame for their personality</strong>.</p>
    <p>New forex traders will want to get rich quickly so they&rsquo;ll start trading small time frames like the 1<strong>-minute or 5-minute charts</strong>.</p>
    <p>Then they end up getting frustrated when they trade because the time frame doesn&rsquo;t fit their personality.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade16-frustrated.png" /></p>
    <p>For some forex traders, they feel most comfortable trading the&nbsp;<strong>1-hour charts.</strong></p>
    <p>This time frame is longer, but not too long, and trade signals are fewer, but not too few.</p>
    <p>Trading on this time frame helps give more time to analyze the market and not feel so rushed.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, we have a friend who could never, ever, trade in a 1-hour time frame.</p>
    <p>It would be way too slow for him and he&rsquo;d probably think he was going to rot and die before he could get in a trade.</p>
    <p>He prefers trading a&nbsp;<strong>10-minute chart</strong>. It still gives him enough time (but not too much) to make decisions based on his trading plan.</p>
    <p>Another buddy of ours can&rsquo;t figure out how forex traders trade on a 1-hour chart because he thinks it&rsquo;s too fast! He trades only&nbsp;<strong>daily, weekly, and monthly charts</strong>.</p>
    <p>Okay, so you&rsquo;re probably asking what the right time frame is for you.</p>
    <p>Well buddy, if you had been paying attention, it depends on your&nbsp;<strong>personality</strong>. You have to feel comfortable with the time frame you&rsquo;re trading in.</p>
    <p>You&rsquo;ll always feel some kind of pressure or sense of frustration when you&rsquo;re in a trade because real money is involved.</p>
    <p><strong>That&rsquo;s natural.</strong></p>
    <p>But you shouldn&rsquo;t feel that the reason for the pressure is because things are happening so fast that you find it difficult to make decisions or so slowly that you get frustrated.</p>
    <p>When we first started trading, we couldn&rsquo;t stick to a time frame.<br /><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2010/11/23152739/upside-down-150x150.png" /></p>
    <p>We started with the 15-minute chart.</p>
    <p>Then the 5-minute chart.</p>
    <p>Then we tried the 1-hour chart, the daily chart, and the 4-hour chart.</p>
    <p>This is natural for all new forex traders until you find your comfort zone and why we suggest that you&nbsp;<strong>DEMO</strong>&nbsp;trade using different time frames to see which fits your personality the best.</p>
