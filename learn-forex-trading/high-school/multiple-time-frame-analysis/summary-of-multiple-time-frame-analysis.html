    <p>So now you&rsquo;re done! Now you can add multiple time frame analysis to your forex trading toolbox!</p>
    <p>Using multiple time frame analysis allows you to:</p>

    <p><strong>Get a bird&rsquo;s eye view.</strong></p>
    <p>Here are a few tips you should remember:</p>
    <p>You have to decide what the correct time frame is for YOU.</p>
    <p>This comes from trying different time frames out through different market environments, recording your results, and analyzing those results to find what works for you.</p>
    <p>Once you&rsquo;ve found your&nbsp;<strong>preferred time frame:</strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li>Go up to the next higher time frame.</li>
    <li>Then make a strategic decision to go long or short based on the direction of the trend.</li>
    <li>Then return to your preferred time frame (or lower) to make tactical decisions about where to enter and exit (place stop and profit target).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Adding the dimension of time to your analysis gives you an edge over the other tunnel vision forex traders who only trade off on only one time frame.</p>
    <p><strong>Make it a habit&nbsp;</strong>to look at multiple time frames when trading<strong>.</strong></p>
    <p>Make sure you practice!</p>
    <ul>
    <li>You don&rsquo;t wanna get caught up in the heat of trading not knowing where the time frame button is!</li>
    <li>Make sure you know how to shift quickly between them.</li>
    <li>Heck, you should even practice having a chart containing multiple time frames up at the same time!</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Choose a set of time frames that you are going to watch, and only concentrate on those time frames.</p>
    <p>Learn all you can about how the market works during those time frames.</p>
    <p><strong>Don&rsquo;t look at too many time frames</strong>, you&rsquo;ll be overloaded with too much information and your brain will explode.</p>
    <p>And you&rsquo;ll end up with a messy desk since there will be blood splattered everywhere.</p>
    <p><strong>Stick to two or three time frames. Any more than that is overkill.</strong></p>
    <p>We can&rsquo;t repeat this enough:</p>

    <p>Using multiple time frames&nbsp;<strong>resolves contradiction</strong>s between indicators and time frames.</p>
