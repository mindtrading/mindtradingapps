    <p>Please keep in mind that&nbsp;<strong>we use divergence as an INDICATOR, not as a signal to enter a trade</strong>!</p>
    <p>It wouldn&rsquo;t be smart to trade based SOLEY on divergences since too many false signals are given.</p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s not 100% foolproof, but when used as a&nbsp;<em>setup condition</em>&nbsp;and combined with&nbsp;<strong>additional confirmation tools</strong>, your trades have a high probability of winning with relatively low risk.</p>
    <p>There are a bunch of ways to take advantage of those divergences.</p>
    <p>One way is to look at trend lines or candlestick patterns to&nbsp;confirm whether a reversal or continuation is in order.</p>
    <p>Another way is to make use of momentum tricks by watching out for an actual crossover or waiting for the oscillator to move out of the overbought/oversold region.</p>

    <p>You can also try drawing&nbsp;<strong>trend lines</strong>&nbsp;on the oscillator too.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade11-divergence-trendline.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>With these nifty tricks, you can guard yourself against false signals and filter out those that&rsquo;ll be very profitable.</p>
    <p>On the flip side, it is just as dangerous trade against this indicator.</p>

    <p>If you&rsquo;re unsure about which direction to trade, chill out on the sidelines.</p>
    <p>Remember that&nbsp;<strong>taking no position is a trading decision in itself</strong>&nbsp;and it&rsquo;s better to hold on to your hard-earned cash than bleed Benjamins on a shaky trade idea.</p>
    <p>Divergences don&rsquo;t appear that often, but when they do appear, it&rsquo;d behoove you to pay attention.</p>
    <p>Regular divergences can help you collect a big chunk of profit because you&rsquo;re able to get in right when the trend changes.</p>
    <p>Hidden divergences can help you ride a trade longer resulting in bigger-than-expected profits by keeping you on the correct side of a trend.</p>

    <p>The trick is to train your eye to spot divergences when they appear AND choose the proper divergences to trade.</p>
    <p>Just because you see a divergence, it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean you should automatically jump in with a position.</p>
    <p>Cherry-pick your setups and you&rsquo;ll increase your odds of winning trades.</p>
