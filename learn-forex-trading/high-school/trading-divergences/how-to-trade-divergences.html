    <p>Now it&rsquo;s time to put those Jedi divergence mind tricks to work and force the markets to give you some pips!</p>
    <p>In this lesson, we&rsquo;ll show you some examples of when there was a divergence between price and oscillator movements.</p>
    <h2>How to Trade a Regular Divergence</h2>
    <p>First up, let&rsquo;s take a look at regular divergence.</p>
    <p>Below is a daily chart of&nbsp;<strong>USD/CHF</strong>.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade11-regular-bullish-divergence.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>We can see from the falling trend line that USD/CHF has been in a&nbsp;<strong>downtrend</strong>.</p>
    <p>However, there are signs that the downtrend will be coming to an end.</p>
    <p>While the price has registered lower lows, the Stochastic&nbsp;(our indicator of choice) is showing a higher low.</p>
    <p>Something smells fishy here.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2010/12/24193401/fish-360x360.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>Is the reversal coming to an end? Is it time to buy this sucker?</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade11-regular-bullish-divergence-end1.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>If you had answered yes to that last question, then you would have found yourself in the middle of the Caribbean, soaking up margaritas, as you would have been knee-deep in your pip winnings!</p>
    <p>It turns out that the divergence between the Stochastic and price action was a good signal to buy.</p>
    <p>Price broke through the falling trend line and formed a new uptrend.</p>
    <p>If you had bought near the bottom, you could have made more than a thousand pips, as the pair continued to shoot even higher in the following months.</p>
    <p>Now can you see why it rocks to get in on the trend early?!</p>
    <p>Before we move on, did you notice the tweezer bottoms that formed on the second low?</p>
    <p><strong>Keep an eye out for other clues that a reversal is in place.</strong>&nbsp;This will give you more confirmation that a trend is coming to an end, giving you even more reason to believe in the power of divergences!</p>
    <h2>How to Trade a Hidden Divergence</h2>
    <p>Next, let&rsquo;s take a look at an example of some hidden divergence.</p>
    <p>Once again, let&rsquo;s hop on to the daily chart of&nbsp;<strong>USD/CHF</strong>.</p>
    <p>https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade11-hidden-bearish-divergence2.png</p>
    <p>Here we see that the pair has been in a&nbsp;<strong>downtrend</strong>.</p>
    <p>Notice how price has formed a lower high but the stochastic is printing higher highs.</p>
    <p>According to our notes, this is a hidden bearish divergence!</p>
    <p>Hmmm, what should we do? Time to get back in the trend?</p>
    <p>Well, if you ain&rsquo;t sure, you can sit back and watch on the sidelines first.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade11-hidden-bearish-divergence-end.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>If you decided to sit that one out, you might be as bald as Professor Xavier now because you pulled out all your hair.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2010/12/24194110/divergence-trade-gone-bad-282x360.jpg" alt="" /></p>
    <p>Why?</p>
    <p>Well, the trend continued!</p>
    <p>Price bounced from the trend line and eventually dropped almost 2,000 pips!</p>
    <p>Imagine if you had spotted the divergence and seen that as a potential signal for a continuation of the trend?</p>
    <p>Not only would you be sipping those margaritas in the Caribbean, but you&rsquo;d also have your own pimpin&rsquo; yacht to boot!</p>
