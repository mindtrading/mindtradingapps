    <p><strong>Divergences</strong>&nbsp;are used by traders in an attempt to determine if a trend is getting&nbsp;<em>weaker</em>, which may lead to a&nbsp;<strong>trend reversal or continuation</strong>.</p>
    <p>Before you head out there and start looking for potential divergences, here are nine cool rules for trading divergences.</p>
    <p>Learn &rsquo;em, memorize &rsquo;em (or keep coming back here), apply &rsquo;em to help you make better trading decisions.</p>
    <p>Ignore them and go broke.</p>
    <h2>1. Make sure your glasses are clean</h2>
    <p>In order for a divergence to exist, the price must have either formed one of the following:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Higher high than the previous high</li>
    <li>Lower low than the previous low</li>
    <li>Double Top</li>
    <li>Double Bottom</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Don&rsquo;t even bother looking at an indicator unless ONE of these four price scenarios has occurred.</p>
    <p>If not, you ain&rsquo;t trading a divergence, buddy.</p>
    <p>You&rsquo;re just imagining things. Immediately go see your optometrist and get some new glasses.</p>

    <h2>2. Draw lines on successive tops and bottoms</h2>
    <p>Okay now that you got some action (recent price action that is), look at it. Remember, you&rsquo;ll only see one of four things:&nbsp;<strong>a higher high, a flat high, a lower low, or a flat low</strong>.</p>
    <p>Now draw a line backward from that high or low to the previous high or low. It HAS to be on successive major tops/bottom.</p>
    <p>If you see any little bumps or dips between the two major highs/lows, do what you do when your significant other shouts at you &ndash; ignore it.</p>
    <h2>3. Connect TOPS and BOTTOMS only</h2>
    <p>Once you see two swing highs are established, you connect the TOPS.</p>
    <p>If two lows are made, you connect the BOTTOMS.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade11-thumbs-up.jpg" alt="" /></p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade11-thumbs-down.jpg" alt="" /></p>
    <h2>4. Keep Your Eyes on the Price</h2>
    <p>So you&rsquo;ve connected either two tops or two bottoms with a trend line. Now look at your preferred technical indicator and compare it to price action.</p>
    <p>Whichever indicator you use, remember you are comparing its TOPS or BOTTOMS.</p>
    <p>Some indicators such as MACD or Stochastic have multiple lines all up on each other like teenagers with raging hormones. Don&rsquo;t worry about what these kids are doing.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade11-thumbs-up.jpg" alt="" /></p>
    <h2>5. Be Consistent With Your Swing Highs and Lows</h2>
    <p>If you draw a line connecting two highs on price, you MUST draw a line connecting the two highs on the indicator as well. Ditto for lows also.</p>
    <p>If you draw a line connecting two lows on price, you MUST draw a line connecting two lows on the indicator. They have to match!</p>

    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade11-thumbs-down.jpg" alt="" /></p>
    <h2>6. Keep Price and Indicator Swings in Vertical Alignment</h2>
    <p>The highs or lows you identify on the indicator MUST be the ones that line up VERTICALLY with the price highs or lows.</p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s just like picking out what to wear to the club, You gotta be fly and matchin&rsquo; yo!</p>
    <p>Maintain&nbsp;<strong>vertical alignment</strong>&nbsp;with the PRICE&rsquo;s swing highs and lows with the INIDCATOR&rsquo;s swing highs and lows.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade11-thumbs-up.jpg" alt="" /></p>
    <h2>7. Watch the Slopes</h2>
    <p>Divergence only exists if the SLOPE of the line connecting the indicator tops/bottoms DIFFERS from the SLOPE of the line connection price tops/bottoms.</p>
    <p>The slope must either be: Ascending (rising) Descending (falling) Flat (flat).</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade11-thumbs-up.jpg" alt="" /></p>
    <p>The image above provides you with two examples: one in pink and the other in blue.</p>
    <p>In the &ldquo;pink&rdquo; example, the pink lines show where divergence is present. As you can see, price made a lower low, while the indicator made a higher low. The slope of the price line is descending (or sloping down), while the indicator line is ascending (or sloping up).</p>
    <p>In the e&rdquo;blue&rdquo; example, the blue lines show no divergence between price and indicator. Both lines are sloped in the same general direct, up.</p>
    <h2>8. If the ship has sailed, catch the next one.</h2>
    <p>If you spot divergence but the price has already reversed and moved in one direction for some time, the divergence should be considered played out.</p>
    <p>You missed the boat this time. All you can do now is wait for another swing high/low to form and start your divergence search over.</p>

    <h2>9. Take a Step Back</h2>
    <p>Divergence signals tend to be more accurate on the&nbsp;<strong>longer time frames</strong>. You get fewer false signals.</p>
    <p>This means fewer trades but if you structure your trade well, then your profit potential can be huge.</p>
    <p>Divergences on shorter time frames will occur more frequently but are&nbsp;<strong>less reliable</strong>.</p>
    <p>We advise only look for divergences on<strong>&nbsp;1-hour charts or longer</strong>.</p>
    <p>Other traders use 15-minute charts or even faster. In those time frames, there&rsquo;s just too much noise for our taste so we just stay away.</p>

    <p>So there you have it!</p>
    <p>Nine rules you MUST (should?) follow if you want to seriously consider trading using divergences.</p>
    <p>Follow these rules, and you will dramatically increase the chances of a divergence setup leading to a profitable trade.</p>
    <p>Now go scan the charts and see if you can spot some divergences that happened in the past as a great way to begin getting your divergence skills up to par!</p>
