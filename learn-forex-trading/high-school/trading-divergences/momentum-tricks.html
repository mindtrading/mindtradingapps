    <p>While using divergences is a great tool to have in your trading toolbox, there are times when you might<strong>&nbsp;enter too early</strong>&nbsp;because you didn&rsquo;t wait for more confirmation.</p>
    <p>If you keep entering too early, you&rsquo;ll keep getting stopped out (you do use stops right?!) and you&rsquo;ll slowly rack up losses.</p>
    <p>And you know what happens when even small losses accumulate, you&rsquo;ll end up broke.</p>
    <p>You&rsquo;ll end up with a<strong>&nbsp;divergence between your mind and your wallet regarding your wealth.</strong></p>

    <p>Below are a couple of tricks of the (divergence) trade that you can make use of so that you have more confirmation that the divergence will work out in your favor.</p>
    <h2>Wait for an&nbsp;indicator&nbsp;crossover.</h2>
    <p>This ain&rsquo;t so much a trick as it is a rule.&nbsp;<strong>Just wait for a crossover of the momentum indicator.</strong></p>
    <p>This would indicate a potential shift in momentum from buying to selling or vice versa.</p>
    <p>The main reasoning behind this is that you are waiting for top or bottom and these can&rsquo;t be formed unless a crossover is made!</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade11-divergence-crossover-before.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>In the chart above, the pair showed lower highs while the Stochastic already made higher highs. Now that&rsquo;s a bearish divergence there and it sure is tempting to short right away.</p>
    <p>But, you know what they say,&nbsp;<strong>patience is a virtue</strong>.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2010/12/24194819/patient-trader-360x360.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>It&rsquo;d be better to wait for Stochastic to make a downward crossover as confirmation that the pair is indeed headed down.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade11-divergence-crossover-after.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>A couple of candles later, the Stochastic did make that crossover. Playing that bearish divergence would&rsquo;ve been piptastic!</p>
    <p>What&rsquo;s the main point here? Just be patient! Don&rsquo;t try to jump the gun because you don&rsquo;t quite know when momentum will shift!</p>
    <p>If you aren&rsquo;t patient, you might just get burned as one side keeps dominating!</p>
    <h2>Wait for the indicator to&nbsp;move out of overbought/oversold territory.</h2>
    <p>Another trick would be to&nbsp;<strong>wait for momentum highs and lows to hit overbought and oversold conditions</strong>, and wait for the indicator to move out of these conditions.</p>
    <p>The reason for doing this is similar to that of waiting for a crossover &ndash; you really don&rsquo;t have any idea when momentum will begin to shift.</p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re looking at a chart and you notice that the Stochastic has formed a new low while the price hasn&rsquo;t.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade11-divergence-overbought.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>You may think that it&rsquo;s time to buy because the indicator is showing oversold conditions and divergence has formed.</p>
    <p>However, selling pressure may remain strong and the price continues to fall and make a new low.</p>
    <p>You would have been pretty bummed out as the trend didn&rsquo;t continue.</p>
    <p>In fact, a new downtrend is probably in place as the pair is now forming lower highs. And if you were stubborn, you might have missed out on this down move too.</p>
    <p>If you had&nbsp;<strong>waited patiently for more confirmation</strong>&nbsp;that the divergence had formed, then you could have avoided losing and realized that a new trend was developing.</p>
    <h2>Draw trend lines on the momentum indicator itself.</h2>
    <p>This might sound a little ridiculous since you would normally draw trend lines only on price action.</p>
    <p>But this is a nifty lil&rsquo; trick that we wanna share with you. After all, it doesn&rsquo;t hurt to have another weapon in the holster right? You never know when you might use it!</p>
    <p>This trick can be particularly useful especially when&nbsp;<strong>looking for reversals or breaks from a trend</strong>. When you see that price is respecting a trend line, try drawing a similar trend line on your indicator.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade11-divergence-trendline.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>You may notice that the indicator will also respect the trend line.</p>
    <p>If you see&nbsp;<strong>both price action and the momentum indicator break their respective trend lines</strong>, it could signal a shift in power from buyers to sellers (or vice versa) and that the trend could be changing.</p>
