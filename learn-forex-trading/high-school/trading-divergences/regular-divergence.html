    <p>What is a regular divergence?</p>
    <p>A&nbsp;<strong>regular divergence</strong>&nbsp;is used as a possible sign for a trend reversal.</p>
    <p>There are two types of regular divergences:&nbsp;<strong>bullish</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>bearish</strong>.</p>
    <h2>Regular&nbsp;<em>Bullish</em>&nbsp;Divergence</h2>
    <p>If the price is&nbsp;<strong>making lower lows (LL), but the oscillator is making higher lows (HL)</strong>, this is considered to be regular bullish divergence.</p>
    <p>This normally occurs at the end of a DOWNTREND.</p>
    <p>After establishing a second bottom, if the oscillator fails to make a new low, it is likely that the price will rise, as price and momentum are normally expected to move in line with each other.</p>
    <p>Below is an image that portrays a regular&nbsp;<strong>bullish divergence</strong>.</p>

    <h2>Regular&nbsp;<em>Bearish</em>&nbsp;Divergence</h2>
    <p>Now, if the price is&nbsp;<strong>making a higher high (HH), but the oscillator is lower high (LH)</strong>, then you have regular bearish divergence.</p>
    <p>This type of divergence can be found in an UPTREND.</p>
    <p>After price makes that&nbsp;<strong>second high</strong>, if the oscillator makes a&nbsp;<strong>lower high</strong>, then you can probably expect the price to&nbsp;<strong>reverse and drop</strong>.</p>
    <p>In the image below, we see that the price reverses after making the second top.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade11-blue-regular-bearish-divergence.jpg" alt="" /></p>
    <p>As you can see from the images above, the regular divergence is best used when trying to&nbsp;<strong>pick tops and bottoms.</strong></p>
    <p>You are looking for&nbsp;<strong>an area where the price will stop and reverse</strong>.</p>
    <p>The oscillator signals to us that&nbsp;<strong>momentum is starting to shift</strong>&nbsp;and even though the price has made a higher high (or lower low), chances are that it won&rsquo;t be sustained.</p>
    <p>Now that you&rsquo;ve got a hold on regular divergence, it&rsquo;s time to move and learn about the second type of divergence&hellip;.<strong>hidden divergence</strong>.</p>
    <p>Don&rsquo;t worry, it&rsquo;s not super concealed like the Chamber of Secrets&nbsp;and it&rsquo;s not that tough to spot.</p>
    <p>The reason it&rsquo;s called &ldquo;hidden&rdquo; is that it&rsquo;s hiding&nbsp;<strong>inside the current trend</strong>.</p>
    <p>We&rsquo;ll explain more in the next section. Read on!</p>
