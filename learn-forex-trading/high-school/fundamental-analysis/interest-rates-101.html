    <p><strong>Interest rates</strong>&nbsp;make the forex world go &rsquo;round!</p>
    <p>In other words, the forex market is&nbsp;ruled by global interest rates.</p>
    <p><strong>A currency&rsquo;s interest rate is probably the biggest factor in determining the perceived value of a currency.</strong></p>
    <p>So knowing how a country&rsquo;s central bank sets its monetary policy, such as interest rate decisions, is a crucial thing to wrap your head around.</p>
    <p>One of the biggest influences on a central bank&rsquo;s interest rate decision is price stability or &ldquo;inflation&rdquo;.</p>
    <p><strong>Inflation is a steady increase in the prices of goods and services.</strong></p>
    <p>Inflation is the reason why your parents or your parents&rsquo; parents paid a nickel for a soda pop in the 1920s, but now people pay twenty times more for the same product.</p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s generally accepted that moderate inflation comes with economic growth.</p>
    <p>However, too much inflation can harm an economy and that&rsquo;s why central banks are always keeping a watchful eye on inflation-related economic indicators, such as the CPI and PCE.</p>

    <p>In an effort to keep inflation at a comfortable level, central banks will most likely increase interest rates, resulting in lower overall growth and slower inflation.</p>
    <p>This occurs because setting high interest rates normally forces consumers and businesses to borrow less and save more, putting a damper on economic activity.</p>
    <p>Loans just become more expensive while sitting on cash becomes more attractive.</p>
    <p>On the other hand,&nbsp;<strong>when interest rates are decreasing, consumers and businesses are more inclined to borrow</strong>&nbsp;(because banks ease lending requirements), boosting retail and capital spending, thus helping the economy to grow.</p>
    <p>Yippee!</p>

    <p>What does this have to do with the forex market?</p>
    <p>Well,&nbsp;<strong>currencies rely on interest rates because these dictate the flow of global capital into and out of a country</strong>.</p>
    <p>They&rsquo;re what investors use to determine if they&rsquo;ll invest in a country or go elsewhere.</p>
    <p>For instance, if you had your choice between a savings account offering a 1% interest rate and&nbsp;another offering .25%, which would you choose?</p>
    <p>Neither, you say?</p>
    <p>Yea, we&rsquo;re inclined to go the same route &ndash; keep the money under the mattress, ya know what we mean? &ndash; but that&rsquo;s not an option.</p>
    <p>Ha! You would pick the 1%, right?</p>
    <p>We hope so&hellip; because 1 is bigger than 0.25. Currencies work the same way!</p>
    <p>The higher a country&rsquo;s interest rate, the more likely its currency will strengthen. Currencies surrounded by lower interest rates are more likely to weaken over the longer term.</p>
    <p>Pretty simple stuff.</p>
    <p>The main point to be learned here is that&nbsp;<strong>domestic interest rates directly affect how global market players feel about a currency&rsquo;s value relative to another</strong>.</p>
    <h2>Interest Rate Expectations</h2>
    <p>Markets are ever-changing with the anticipation of different events and situations. Interest rates do the same thing &ndash; they change &ndash; but they definitely don&rsquo;t change as often.</p>
    <p>Most forex traders don&rsquo;t spend their time focused on current interest rates because the market has already &ldquo;priced&rdquo; them into the currency price.</p>
    <p>What is more important is where interest rates are&nbsp;<strong>EXPECTED</strong>&nbsp;to go.</p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s also important to know that interest rates tend to shift in line with monetary policy, or more specifically, with the end of monetary cycles.</p>
    <p>If rates have been going lower and lower over a period of time, it&rsquo;s almost inevitable that the opposite will happen.</p>
    <p>Rates will have to increase at some point.</p>
    <p>And you can count on the speculators to try to figure out when that will happen and by how much.</p>
    <p>The market will tell them; it&rsquo;s the nature of the beast. A shift in expectations is a signal that a shift in speculation will start, gaining more momentum as the interest rate change nears.</p>
    <p>While interest rates change with the gradual shift of monetary policy, market sentiment can also change rather suddenly from just a single report.</p>
    <p>This causes interest rates to change in a more drastic fashion or even in the opposite direction as originally anticipated.&nbsp;So you better watch out!</p>
    <p>Below is an example of one of many ways to monitor interest rate expectations and is one of the most-watched news releases.</p>
    <p>The Federal Reserve&rsquo;s &ldquo;<strong>dot plot</strong>.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>The U.S. central bank uses this signal its outlook for the path of interest rates,</p>
    <p>The&nbsp;<strong>Fed Dot Plot</strong>, which is published after each Fed meeting, shows the projections of the 16 members of the Federal Open Market Committee (the bigwigs in the Fed who are&nbsp;actually are in charge of setting interest rates).</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2010/12/fed-dot-plot.png" alt="" /></p>
    <h2>Interest Rate Differentials</h2>
    <p>Pick a pair, any pair.</p>
    <p>Many forex traders use a technique of comparing one currency&rsquo;s interest rate to another currency&rsquo;s interest rate as the starting point for deciding whether a currency may weaken or strengthen.</p>
    <p>The difference between the two interest rates, known as the &ldquo;<strong>interest rate differential</strong>,&rdquo; is the key value to keep an eye on.</p>
    <p>This spread can help you identify shifts in currencies that might not be obvious.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2010/12/interest-rate-differential.gif" alt="" /></p>
    <p>An&nbsp;<strong>interest rate differential&nbsp;</strong>that increases helps to reinforce the higher-yielding currency, while a narrowing differential is positive for the lower-yielding currency.</p>
    <p>Instances where the interest rates of the two countries move in opposite directions often produce some of the market&rsquo;s largest swings.</p>
    <p>An interest rate increase in one currency combined with the interest rate decrease of the other currency is the perfect equation for sharp swings!</p>
    <h2>Nominal vs. Real Interest Rates</h2>
    <p>When people talk about interest rates, they are either referring to the nominal interest rate or the real interest rate.</p>
    <p>What&rsquo;s the difference?</p>
    <p>The nominal interest rate doesn&rsquo;t always tell the entire story. The nominal interest rate is the rate of interest before adjustments for inflation.</p>
    <p><strong>Real interest rate = Nominal interest rate &ndash; Expected inflation</strong></p>
    <p>The nominal rate is usually the stated or base rate that you see (e.g., the yield on a bond).</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2010/12/nominal-vs-real-interest-rate.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>Markets, on the other hand, don&rsquo;t focus on this rate, but rather on the&nbsp;<strong>real interest rate</strong>.</p>
    <p>If you had a bond that carried a nominal yield of 6%, but inflation was at an annual rate of 5%, the bond&rsquo;s real yield would be 1%.</p>
    <p>Boohoo!</p>
    <p>That&rsquo;s a huge difference so always remember to distinguish between the two.</p>
