    <p>There&rsquo;s no one &ldquo;All in&rdquo; or &ldquo;Bet the Farm&rdquo; formula for success when it comes to predicting how the market will react to data reports or market events or even why it reacts the way it does.</p>
    <p>You can draw on the fact that there&rsquo;s usually an&nbsp;<strong>initial response</strong>, which is usually short-lived, but full of action.</p>
    <p>Later on, comes the&nbsp;<strong>second reaction</strong>, where forex traders have had some time to reflect on the implications of the news or report on the current market.</p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s at this point when the market decides if the news release&nbsp;<strong>went along with</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>against</strong>&nbsp;the existing expectation and if it reacted accordingly.</p>
    <p>Was the outcome of the report expected or not? And what does the initial response of the market tell us about the bigger picture?</p>
    <p>Answering those questions gives us a place to start interpreting the ensuing price action.</p>
    <h2>Consensus Market Expectations</h2>
    <p><img title="Market Expectations to Forex News" src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade14-surprise.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>A&nbsp;<strong>consensus expectation</strong>, or just consensus, is the relative agreement on upcoming economic or news forecasts.</p>
    <p>Economic forecasts are made by various leading economists from banks, financial institutions, and other securities-related entities.</p>
    <p>Your favorite news personality gets into the mix by surveying her in-house economist and collection of financially sound &ldquo;players&rdquo; in the market.</p>
    <p>All the forecasts get pooled together and averaged out, and it&rsquo;s these averages that appear on charts and calendars designating the level of expectation for that report or event.</p>
    <p>The consensus becomes ground zero; the incoming, or actual data is compared against this baseline number.</p>
    <p>Incoming data normally gets identified in the following manner:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>&ldquo;As expected&rdquo; &ndash;&nbsp;</strong>the reported data was close to or at the consensus forecast.</li>
    <li><strong>&ldquo;Better-than-expected&rdquo;</strong>&ndash; the reported data was better than the consensus forecast.</li>
    <li><strong>&ldquo;Worse-than-expected&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; the reported data was worse than the consensus forecast.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Whether or not incoming data meets consensus is an important evaluation for determining price action.</p>
    <p>Just as important is the determination of&nbsp;<strong>how much better or worse the actual data is than the consensus forecast</strong>.</p>
    <p><strong>Larger degrees of inaccuracy</strong>&nbsp;increase the chance and extent to which the price may change once the report is out.</p>
    <p>However, let&rsquo;s remember that forex traders are smart, and can be ahead of the curve. Well the good ones, anyway.</p>
    <h2>What&rsquo;s priced in?</h2>
    <p>Many forex traders have already &ldquo;<strong>priced in</strong>&rdquo; consensus expectations into their trading and into the market well before the report is scheduled, let alone released.</p>
    <p>As the name implies, &ldquo;priced in&rdquo; refers to traders having a view on the outcome of an event and placing bets on it before the news comes out.</p>
    <p>The more likely a report is to shift the price, the sooner traders will price in consensus expectations. How can you tell if this is the case with the current market?</p>
    <p>Well, that&rsquo;s a tough one.</p>
    <p>You can&rsquo;t always tell, so you have to take it upon yourself to stay on top of what the market commentary is saying and what price action is doing before a report gets released.</p>
    <p>This will give you an idea of how much the market has priced in.</p>
    <p>A lot can happen before a report is released, so keep your eyes and ears peeled.</p>
    <p><strong>Market sentiment </strong>can improve or get worse just before a release, so be aware that price can react with or against the trend.</p>
    <p>There is always the possibility that a data report totally misses expectations, so don&rsquo;t bet the farm away on the expectations of others. When the miss occurs, you&rsquo;ll be sure to see price movement occur.</p>
    <p>Help yourself out for such an event by anticipating it (and other possible outcomes) to happen.</p>
    <p>Play the &ldquo;What if&hellip;&rdquo; game.</p>
    <p>Ask yourself, &ldquo;What if A happens? What if B happens?</p>
    <p>How will traders react or change their bets?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>You could even be more specific.</p>
    <p>What if the report comes in under expectation by half a percent? How many pips down will the price move? What would need to happen with this report that could cause a 40 pip drop? Anything?</p>
    <p>Come up with your&nbsp;<strong>different scenarios</strong>&nbsp;and be prepared to react to the market&rsquo;s reaction. Being proactive in this manner will keep you ahead of the game.</p>

    <h2>What the heck?! They revised the data?!! Now what?!!!</h2>
    <p>Too many questions&hellip; in that title.</p>
    <p>But that&rsquo;s right, economic data can and will get revised.</p>
    <p>That&rsquo;s just how economic reports roll!</p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s take the monthly Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) as an example.</p>
    <p>As stated, this report comes out monthly, and usually included with it are revisions of the previous month&rsquo;s numbers.</p>
    <p>We&rsquo;ll assume that the U.S. economy is in a slump and January&rsquo;s NFP figure decreases by 50,000, which is the number of jobs lost. It&rsquo;s now February, and NFP is expected to decrease by another 35,000.</p>
    <p>But the incoming NFP actually decreases by only 12,000, which is totally unexpected.</p>
    <p>Also, January&rsquo;s revised data, which appears in the February report, was revised upwards to show only a 20,000 decrease.</p>
    <p><img title="NFP table and revisions" src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade14-NFP-example.png" alt="" /><br /><strong>As a trader, you have to be aware of situations like this when data is revised.</strong></p>
    <p>Not having known that January data was revised, you might have a negative reaction to an additional 12,000 jobs lost in February.</p>
    <p>That&rsquo;s still two months of decreases in employment, which ain&rsquo;t good.</p>
    <p>However, taking into account the upwardly revised NFP figure for January and the better-than-expected February NFP reading, the market might see the start of a turning point.</p>
    <p>The state of employment now looks totally different when you look at incoming data&nbsp;<strong>AND</strong>&nbsp;last month&rsquo;s revised data.</p>
    <p>Be sure not only to&nbsp;<strong>determine if revised data exists</strong>&nbsp;but also the&nbsp;<strong>scale of the revision</strong>. Bigger revisions carry more weight when analyzing the current data releases.</p>
    <p>Revisions can help to confirm a possible trend change or no change at all, so be aware of what&rsquo;s been released.</p>
