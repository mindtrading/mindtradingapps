        <p>In the previous lesson, I discussed how to use fundamental analysis to&nbsp;<strong>understand specific cryptocurrencies</strong>&nbsp;you&rsquo;re interested in, develop a&nbsp;<strong>directional bias</strong>&nbsp;(&ldquo;bullish&rdquo; or &ldquo;bearish&rdquo;), and then determine if any look like potential&nbsp;<strong>trade ideas</strong>&nbsp;(go &ldquo;long&rdquo; or &ldquo;short&rdquo;).</p>
        <p>Once you&rsquo;ve got your directional bias based on fundamental analysis, it&rsquo;s now time to determine potential&nbsp;<strong>entry prices&nbsp;</strong>(&ldquo;entries&rdquo;)&nbsp;for your trade, as well as&nbsp;<strong>exit prices</strong>&nbsp;(&ldquo;exits&rdquo;) to take a profit or cut your loss.</p>
        <p>For a discretionary trader, this is typically done using&nbsp;<strong>technical analysis (TA)</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>price action (PA)</strong>.</p>
        <p>In this lesson, you&rsquo;re going to learn how to use technical analysis and price action to identify&nbsp;<strong>entry and exit points</strong>&nbsp;when trading crypto.</p>
        <h2>What is the market price?</h2>
        <p>But before jumping into what TA and PA are, we need to have a quick discussion on what the market price is and why it&rsquo;s constantly changing in the financial markets.</p>
        <p><strong>Price is essentially the value at which a buyer and seller agree to make a trade</strong>.</p>
        <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/08/04103454/market-pricing-360x360.png" /></p>
        <p>For example, pretend we&rsquo;re at a farmers&rsquo; market, and let&rsquo;s say a farmer is selling a bag of apples for&nbsp;<strong>$1.00</strong>. If you or someone else agrees that&rsquo;s a fair price and gives $1.00 for a bag of apples, then&nbsp;<strong>the market price is $1.00</strong>.</p>
        Now, if no customers buy a bag of apples for $1.00 that day, then the farmer may lower the price to&nbsp;<strong>$0.95</strong>&nbsp;(or lower) until customers start buying.
        <p>And vice versa&hellip;. if buyers buy out all of the apples at $1.00 and are asking for more, the farmer will likely raise their price for a bag of apples to&nbsp;<strong>$1.10 (or higher)</strong>&nbsp;until the demand for apples slows or stops.</p>
        <p>It&rsquo;s the same with financial assets, but on a much, much larger scale. In the financial markets, there could be thousands upon thousands of buyers and sellers for a single asset, all with different ideas of how much they&rsquo;re willing to buy/sell and at what price.</p>
        <p>And these transactions happen at a much faster pace, many in as little as fractions of a second, depending on the asset being traded.</p>
        <p>With so many market participants and transactions happening every second, the market price will move constantly, depending on the&nbsp;<strong>balance between buyers and sellers.</strong>&nbsp;Or in other words, the balance between the asset&rsquo;s&nbsp;<strong>supply and demand</strong>.</p>
        It&rsquo;s impossible to know exactly what each market player is up to and their reasons for buying or selling at specific prices.
        <p>A spectrum of players from small retail &ldquo;fish&rdquo; to large institutional &ldquo;whales&rdquo; could be trading based on a narrative based on fundamentals, pure speculation on price action, or something as obscure as the migration patterns of African elephants.</p>
        <p>It&rsquo;s basically impossible to know what every trader is thinking so the best we can say about any market environment is that&nbsp;<strong>the price reflects all known public information about the asset and what the collective feeling is on that asset&rsquo;s outlook</strong>&nbsp;(i.e., market sentiment).</p>
        <p>That brings us back to price action and technical analysis.</p>
        <h2>What is price action? What is technical analysis?</h2>
        <p><strong>Price action and technical analysis is the practice of understanding the market sentiment of an asset through a visual or mathematical framework around price history</strong>.</p>
        <p>Through this lens, a trader can understand when market sentiment was&nbsp;<strong>bullish, bearish, or neutral,</strong>&nbsp;and be able to find potential points of inflection or sentiment change.</p>
        <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/08/04103916/chart-analysis-crypto-360x360.png" /></p>
        <p>To illustrate this concept, let&rsquo;s do a quick analysis using price action and technical analysis on bitcoin against the U.S. dollar (BTC/USD) to see what traders are feeling:</p>
        <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/08/01205110/BTC-TA-PAA-example.png" /></p>
        <p>In the chart above, we have BTC/USD price action on the four-hour timeframe, and in terms of price action, we can see that in the month of November, traders were&nbsp;<strong>bearish</strong>&nbsp;as they took the market from near $70,000 to as low as $54,000 before the month end.</p>
        <p>We can also see that&nbsp;<strong>$58,000 and $60,000</strong>&nbsp;were strong areas of interest, first acting as a&nbsp;<strong>support</strong>&nbsp;area in October, then breaking in November and turning into an area of&nbsp;<strong>resistance</strong>, telling us that could be an area that draws in sell orders if bearish sentiment persists.</p>
        Or it could be an area that draws in buy orders if the price breaks above in the near term.
        <p>I also have a technical indicator in the chart at the bottom, the MACD indicator. This indicator is used by many traders to show them when price momentum may be peaking.</p>
        <p>And in this scenario, the MACD&rsquo;s move higher may be signaling that the short-term pop higher in BTC/USD price from $54,000 to $58,000 may be overdone, adding a TA argument that traders may resume the selling pressure.</p>
        <p>So if your fundamental analysis is telling you that BTC/USD could potentially see more selling ahead, then this chart analysis supports a similar point, strengthening the bear case.</p>
        <p>Did that make sense?</p>
        <p>If that all seemed alien to you, don&rsquo;t worry! You can learn more about MACD and other technical indicators by reading our technical analysis lessons for beginners in our School of Pipsology!</p>
        <p>But before checking it out, here are some tips to keep in mind before you start off on that journey.</p>
        <h2>Tips on Using Technical Analysis and Price Action</h2>
        <h3>There IS such a thing as &ldquo;doing too much&rdquo; when it comes to technical analysis and price action.</h3>
        <p>Throwing up too many indicators tends to lead to a phenomenon called &ldquo;<strong>analysis paralysis</strong>.&rdquo; This is where indicators start conflicting with each other as some tools flash &ldquo;buy&rdquo; signals against others saying it&rsquo;s time to &ldquo;sell.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Study the different TA and PA tools and find no more than 2 or 3 that make the most sense to start your journey with and practice religiously.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Multicollinearity</strong>&nbsp;is a statistical term referring to the use of the&nbsp;<em>same</em>&nbsp;type of information more than once.&nbsp;Successful use of technical analysis requires avoiding multicollinearity when using multiple technical indicators.&nbsp;You want to avoid using technical indicators that are &ldquo;collinear&rdquo; in that they are based on very similar or related input resulting in redundant information.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h3>Don&rsquo;t use technical analysis or price action alone as a trade idea generation tool.</h3>
        <p>In most cases, you should not use TA or PA by themselves as a trade idea generation tool, especially for crypto assets.</p>
        <p>Technical analysis and price action are always backward-looking, so they will NOT tell you when potentially major catalysts lie ahead or give you the knowledge as to why market sentiment is leaning one way or the other.</p>
        <p>By using technical analysis and/or price action as your only analysis tool, you increase the odds of being blindsided by a surprise event.</p>
        <p>For beginners, that&rsquo;s why I recommend using fundamental analysis to generate trade ideas, and then using technical analysis and price action to find trade entries and exits.</p>
