    <p>Let&rsquo;s review what you&rsquo;ve learned so far from previous lessons about creating a crypto trading strategy.</p>
    <p>You learned:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>How to use fundamental analysis to look at a cryptocurrency, develop a&nbsp;<strong>directional bias</strong>&nbsp;(&ldquo;bullish&rdquo; or &ldquo;bearish&rdquo;), and generate potential&nbsp;<strong>trade ideas</strong>&nbsp;(go &ldquo;long&rdquo; or &ldquo;short&rdquo;).</li>
    <li>How to use technical analysis (TA) and price action (PA) to identify&nbsp;<strong>entry prices&nbsp;</strong>(&ldquo;entries&rdquo;)&nbsp;for your trade, as well as&nbsp;<strong>exit prices</strong>&nbsp;(&ldquo;exits&rdquo;) to take a profit or cut your loss.</li>
    <li>Three key concepts in trade and risk management&nbsp;to survive as a trader.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The last required task for our discretionary trading process is keeping a&nbsp;<strong>trade journal.&nbsp;</strong></p>

    <h2>What is a crypto trading journal?</h2>
    <p>A trading journal is a log that you use to record your trades. It tracks your trading performance and more importantly, helps you<strong>&nbsp;reflect upon previous trades and learn from any mistakes made</strong>.</p>
    <p>Taking notes and writing out your thoughts are skills many people do not practice or enjoy on a regular basis, but when it comes to achieving competency in your craft, this is a habit you should take up quickly.</p>
    <p><strong>A disciplined trader is a profitable trader and keeping a trading journal is the first step to building your discipline.</strong></p>
    <p>Journaling is a process that seems to be required in most professions, not just in the trading world. Doctors take notes on patients&rsquo; health and treatments.</p>
    <p>Professional athletes break down and review practices and games, taking notes to find ways to improve their craft on and off the court.</p>
    <p>In general, taking notes and journaling is a valuable task for achieving any goal in life. As the saying goes, &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t manage what you don&rsquo;t measure.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Without a journal to track your trading business, the odds are pretty high that you&rsquo;re going to forget pieces of your analysis, trading plan, and catalysts to watch out for. You&rsquo;ll likely&nbsp;<strong>make the same mistakes over and over,</strong>&nbsp;and never see real improvement in your trading performance.</p>
    <p>As you go through each step in the discretionary trading process, jot down your observations and thoughts like your life depends on it because, in one sense, it kinda does.</p>
    <p>That money (your &ldquo;trading capital&rdquo;) you&rsquo;re putting at risk represents energy and time you&rsquo;ve given over your life, so take this task as seriously as a doctor or professional athlete would.</p>
    <h2>What&rsquo;s in a trading journal?</h2>
    <p>Here&rsquo;s a sample of what you&rsquo;d include in a trading journal:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>As you read the news daily to get a view of how markets are behaving, write down any notable news and events and your biases/expectations.</li>
    <li>Use fundamental analysis to develop a directional bias and generate trade idea(s). Write them down.</li>
    <li>Use technical analysis and price action to spot entry and exit points. Write them down.</li>
    <li>Write down your trade and risk management plan.</li>
    <li>Separate your trade ideas between ones that are &ldquo;ready to go live&rdquo; and ones to &ldquo;stalk&rdquo; on a watchlist (those ideas that haven&rsquo;t met all of the criteria for a live trade yet) in your trading journal.</li>
    <li>Track pending orders and open trades.</li>
    <li>Adjust your trade and risk management plan accordingly to new developments. Document these adjustments.</li>
    <li>After closing a trade, note the market&rsquo;s behavior and write down why your trade did or did not work.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Regularly review your trading journal</strong>&nbsp;and see if there are any lessons to be learned and adjustments to make to any of your processes going forward.</p>

    <p>But before you head over there, keep in mind the one trick that significantly raises your odds of successfully developing a journaling habit:&nbsp;<strong>Keep it simple and be consistent</strong>.</p>
    <p>Even if all you have is an online spreadsheet with three columns of data, one being the &ldquo;<strong>Date</strong>,&rdquo; another being &ldquo;<strong>Market Thoughts</strong>&rdquo; filled with generalized observations, and the last being &ldquo;<strong>My Market Expectations,</strong>&rdquo; it&rsquo;s a great starting point!</p>
    <div>
    <div>
    <table border="1px">
    <tbody>
    <tr>
    <td><strong>Date</strong></td>
    <td><strong>Market Thoughts</strong></td>
    <td><strong>My Market Expectations</strong></td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>
    </div>
    </div>
    <p>Remember that you&rsquo;re just&nbsp;<strong>beginning your journey</strong>&nbsp;and it doesn&rsquo;t have to be perfect.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/08/17171401/maintain-trading-journal.png" /></p>
    <p>You just have to do it.</p>
    <p>If you can scroll through TikTok every day for hours, then you can spend a fraction of that time journaling.</p>
    <p>It will get better over time as long as you&nbsp;<strong>stay consistent with your efforts</strong>&nbsp;and apply what you learn along the way to make your journal better.</p>
