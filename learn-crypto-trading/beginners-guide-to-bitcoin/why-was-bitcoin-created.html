    <p>What exactly is Bitcoin?</p>
    <p>Depending on who you ask, the word &ldquo;Bitcoin&rdquo; can have many different definitions.</p>
    <p>And as some start explaining what Bitcoin is, that&rsquo;s when you&rsquo;ll typically start hearing tech jargon spewed out.</p>
    <p>Words like &ldquo;<strong>blockchain</strong>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<strong>protocol</strong>&rdquo;.And phrases like &ldquo;<strong>peer-to-peer networks</strong>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<strong>distributed ledgers</strong>&rdquo;.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/02/16200543/bitcoin-jargon-360x353.png" /></p>
    <p>OMG! Jargon overload! ðŸ¤®</p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s easy to feel like you&rsquo;re drowning in a sea of terms. Trying to accurately describe &ldquo;Bitcoin&rdquo; can get technical and complicated&nbsp;<em>really</em>&nbsp;fast! ðŸ¤¯</p>
    <p>So rather than go that route,&nbsp;I think a better approach is to start with the PROBLEMS that Bitcoin was trying to solve.</p>
    <p>Once you understand that, everything will become much clearer for you and you&rsquo;ll be able to grasp the technical concepts faster and follow along much more easily.</p>
    <h2>Why was Bitcoin created?</h2>
    <p>According to the Bitcoin white paper, Satoshi Nakamoto wanted to create:</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;&hellip;<strong>electronic cash</strong>&nbsp;that would allow online payments to be sent&nbsp;<strong>directly</strong>&nbsp;from one party to another&nbsp;<strong>without going through a financial institution</strong>.&rdquo;</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Translation:</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;<strong>Physical cash</strong>&nbsp;allows me to transact directly in the REAL WORLD with another person without the need of a bank. I like this freedom. I want this same freedom ONLINE. So I need a digital version of cash or&nbsp;<strong>digital cash</strong>. &rdquo;</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Satoshi&rsquo;s answer:&nbsp;<strong>Bitcoin</strong>.</p>
    <p>The concept of creating a digital version of cash that can be sent around online without a &ldquo;trusted intermediary&rdquo; sounds simple but before Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin, all previous attempts were unsuccessful.</p>
    <p><strong>This had never been done before.</strong></p>
    <p>Let me explain why using an example.</p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s say that&nbsp;<strong>Ursula the Unicorn</strong>&nbsp;bakes and sells cupcakes.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/02/16203447/ursula-the-baker.png"  /></p>
    <p>These cupcakes are special. They sing. They&rsquo;re waterproof.</p>
    <p>They are singing waterproof cupcakes!</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/02/16204226/singing-cupcake.png" /></p>
    <p>And each cupcake only cost $1. With air delivery, via unicorn, included for free.</p>
    <p><strong>Molly the Mermaid</strong>&nbsp;wants to buy one cupcake from Ursula.</p>
    <p>So they meet up and transact with cold hard&nbsp;<strong>cash</strong>.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2019/02/26191559/cash-transaction1.png" /></p>
    <p>Here&rsquo;s what happens:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Molly gives the $1 bill to Ursula.</li>
    <li>The $1 bill is now&nbsp;<strong>physically owned</strong>&nbsp;by Ursula.</li>
    <li>Ursula trusts that the $1 bill is&nbsp;<strong>unique</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>real</strong>.</li>
    <li>The $1 bill is unique and real because it can be&nbsp;<strong>verified</strong>&nbsp;since it&rsquo;s issued by a central bank.</li>
    <li>Due to these properties, the $1 bill is used as a&nbsp;<strong>medium of exchange&hellip;</strong>meaning other people are willing to&nbsp;<em>exchange</em>&nbsp;the $1 bill for stuff (&ldquo;goods and services&rdquo;) they want.</li>
    <li>Ursula gives the cupcake to Molly.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Now let&rsquo;s say that Molly is soooo far away that the distance would be even way too far for even Ursula to fly and deliver the cupcake herself. She&rsquo;ll have to ship it via an air courier service like FedEx or UPS.</p>
    <p>Ursula wants Molly to send payment first&hellip;.<strong>online</strong>.</p>
    <p>But how will Molly handle payment?</p>
    <p>How can Molly&nbsp;<strong>send cash over the internet?</strong></p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/02/16212319/digitize-cash-1.png" /></p>
    <p>There lies the problem with cash.</p>
    <p>Cash is&nbsp;<strong>money in the PHYSICAL form of currency</strong>, such as paper banknotes (dollah dollah billz yo!) and metal coins.</p>
    <p>But we have a problem&hellip;.</p>
    <p>You can&rsquo;t send physical cash over the internet!</p>
    <p>Buyers and sellers have to be&nbsp;<strong>physically present at the same location</strong>&nbsp;in order to transact in cash, which isn&rsquo;t always possible.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/02/16213224/face-to-face-transaction.png" /></p>
    <p>Since cash is physical, how do you transfer it online?</p>
    <p>By digitizing it&hellip;by making it&nbsp;<strong>digital</strong>.</p>
    <p>But if it&rsquo;s digital, that means it can be easily reproduced (digital counterfeit).</p>
    <p><strong>So how do you prevent people from spending their digital money twice (or more)?</strong></p>
    <p>So that&rsquo;s one problem.</p>
    <p>There&rsquo;s another problem.</p>
    <p>Molly wants to use cash because she already has some in her wallet. But if she wants to send cash&nbsp;<em>electronically</em>&nbsp;(in digital form), now she has to rely on a financial institution like a bank.</p>
    <p>But what if Molly didn&rsquo;t have an account with a bank? Sorry Molly, no cupcakes for you then.</p>
    <p>Fortunately, in this story, Molly&nbsp;<em>does</em>&nbsp;have a bank account.</p>
    <p>But when we&rsquo;re dependent on such financial institutions, this poses a threat or risk.</p>
    <p>For example, let&rsquo;s say the greedy sharks who run the bank love cookies and hate cupcakes.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/02/16210226/shark-banker-263x360.png" /></p>
    <p>So the bank, not being a fan of cupcakes, may abuse its power and decide to block Molly&rsquo;s transaction.&nbsp;<strong>The bank will not allow any transactions related to cupcakes!</strong></p>
    <p>Say what?! Heartless I tell you!</p>
    <p>Or the bank may charge extra fees for non-local transactions.</p>
    <p>Or even worse, the bank sees unicorns as evil, along with anybody who does business with unicorns as automatically evil also.</p>
    <p>So even though Molly is a mermaid, she&rsquo;s seen as &ldquo;evil&rdquo; because she&rsquo;s trying to buy cupcakes from a unicorn!</p>
    <p>As a result, the bank may freeze Molly&rsquo;s account and now Molly can&rsquo;t even access her money. Molly the Mermaid is locked out!</p>
    <p>The bank is holding Molly&rsquo;s money hostage. The bank is the single entity in control of all of her money. Since there is a single entity in charge, this is considered&nbsp;<strong>centralized</strong>.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;Centralized&rdquo; means one point or source of control.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2019/02/26200955/bank-censorship.png" /></p>
    <p>Molly just wants her cupcake and is frustrated.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;If I were able to use cash, I wouldn&rsquo;t have to go through my bank! Gosh, darn it! This sucks!&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;I wish a digital form of cash existed.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;That I&rsquo;m in&nbsp;<strong>total control</strong>&nbsp;of.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;I want to be able to use this digital form of cash just like the cold hard cash in my tail where I can spend it however I want with whoever I want&nbsp;<strong>without needing the approval of any person, company, or institution</strong>.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>So Molly basically wants two big things:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Digital money that can be used online like&nbsp;<strong>cash</strong>&hellip;.</li>
    <li>That is&nbsp;<strong>decentralized</strong>.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Decentralization is the exact opposite of centralization. With decentralization, there is not one single entity in charge.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Decentralized is where control and decision-making is shared among participants.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In terms of money, &ldquo;<strong>decentralization</strong>&rdquo; means that you don&rsquo;t have to go through an intermediary like a bank or other financial institution.</p>
    <p>This would give you&nbsp;<strong>the freedom</strong>&nbsp;to spend digital money any way you please without the risk of your transactions being blocked or your money being frozen or taken away from you.</p>
    <p>Molly wants&nbsp;<strong>decentralized digital cash</strong>.</p>
    <p>But this is actually extremely difficult to accomplish!</p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s learn why&hellip;</p>
