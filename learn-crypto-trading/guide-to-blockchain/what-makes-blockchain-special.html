    <p>Blockchain this. Blockchain that.</p>
    <p>In the previous lesson, I gave a high-level technical overview of what a blockchain is that hopefully wasn&rsquo;t too boring.</p>
    <p>Now that you know what it is&hellip;</p>
    <p><strong>What&rsquo;s so special about blockchain technology?</strong></p>
    <p>Asking what&rsquo;s so special about blockchain is like asking what&rsquo;s so special about the internet. Or electricity. Or the light bulb.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/03/13135748/lightbulb-150x150.png" /></p>
    <p>Or getting crispy McDonald&rsquo;s french fries fresh from the fryer.</p>
    <p>Yep, it&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;special.</p>
    <p>Here&rsquo;s why&hellip;</p>
    <p>Before blockchain, if you had to store data on a computer that was super important, you needed someone or some entity to OWN and CONTROL the data. Which meant a&nbsp;<strong>central authority</strong>&nbsp;was needed.</p>
    <p>For example, your&nbsp;<strong>bank account balance</strong>. The bank owns this data and controls how the data is updated.</p>
    <p>Your bank ensures that every transaction is valid and authorized by the customer whose funds it moves. Your bank will never let you modify their database directly, even if you ask nicely.</p>
    <p>The bank has to hire IT security folks to protect its data from hackers and other unauthorized people.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/03/13135928/bank-security-150x150.png" /></p>
    <p>Even before computers, this was a problem.</p>
    <p>To maintain an&nbsp;<strong>account</strong>&nbsp;or any sort of record of transactions, you always needed to designate a person or entity as the &ldquo;central authority&rdquo;.</p>
    <p>This central authority would be the one who maintained the&nbsp;<strong>LEDGER</strong>, or record of transactions.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/03/13140719/paper-record-150x150.png" /></p>
    <p>Back in the day, a ledger was basically a piece of paper or an artisan-made leather-bound notebook, updated by hand and kept in a safe place like&hellip;in one&rsquo;s desk drawer.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/03/13140355/book-ledger-150x150.png" /></p>
    <p>But once computers were available, the&nbsp;<strong>ledger was transferred into a database</strong>&nbsp;stored on a hard drive of a centrally located computer that was (hopefully) well guarded.</p>
    <p>Later, IT folks realized it probably wasn&rsquo;t a good idea to just have the database stored on just one computer, because if the hard drive crashed or the computer overheated and burst into flames, the data would be gone forever.</p>
    <p>So the database was&nbsp;<strong>REPLICATED across multiple computers</strong>&nbsp;to keep the data safe.</p>
    <p>But even with the database having multiple copies, these copies still&nbsp;<strong>relied on the primary or &ldquo;official&rdquo; database</strong>. Which was still owned and controlled by a central authority.</p>
    <p>This also meant that if you could somehow hack into the&nbsp;<strong>primary</strong>&nbsp;or &ldquo;official&rdquo; database, you could tamper with the ledger and do bad things like uh&hellip;.add extra zeros to your bank account balance.</p>
    <p>This&nbsp;<strong>single point of control</strong>&nbsp;is a big weakness of having to rely on a central authority.</p>
    <p>What if there was a better way?</p>
    <p>What if there was a way to maintain a ledger without needing a bank or other central authority to own and control the ledger?</p>
    <p>Enter&nbsp;<strong>blockchain technology</strong>.</p>
    <p>Before Satoshi Nakamoto came up with the concept of a blockchain, nobody had figured out a solution on how to maintain a decentralized ledger.</p>
    <p>But the Bitcoin God figured it out!</p>
    <p>Instead of needing an &ldquo;owner&rdquo; for the database, his approach was to store the database&nbsp;<strong>across a computer network</strong>.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/03/13140913/peer-to-peer-network-of-computers.png" /></p>
    <p>A computer network is just a bunch of computers that are physically located in different parts of the world and communicate with each other using the internet.</p>
    <p>Each computer on the network stores its OWN &ldquo;official&rdquo; copy of the database.</p>
    <p>That means that there is no &ldquo;main&rdquo; copy though. Every copy of the database IS the main copy!</p>
    <p>This is where &ldquo;<strong>distributed ledger</strong>&rdquo; comes from.</p>
    <p>Computers are physically located in different places across the world. And each computer keeps a copy of the &ldquo;ledger&rdquo; (the database).</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/03/13141716/computers-across-global-network.png" /></p>
    <p>The computers check and verify transactions to make sure they are all legit before making changes to the database.</p>
    <p>Whenever updates are made, the database is shared across the entire network to make sure every computer is keeping the same copy.</p>
    <p>The &ldquo;distributed&rdquo; part comes from the fact that the computers are geographically distributed in different locations and communicate with each other on a network to make sure every computer is using the same &ldquo;ledger&rdquo; (database).</p>
    <p>This database is also made PUBLIC for everyone to view in real-time, including any changes.</p>
    <p>The blockchain killed the need for&nbsp;<strong>CENTRALIZED ownership and control</strong>&nbsp;of digital data.</p>
    <p>Instead of having to rely on a &ldquo;central&nbsp;<strong>authority</strong>&rdquo; to decide on when to update the ledger, the blockchain relies on &ldquo;<strong>consensus</strong>&rdquo; among all the computers on the network.</p>
    <p>How the computers come to a consensus is based on a programmed set of rules and instructions called a&nbsp;<strong>protocol</strong>.</p>
    <p>This protocol runs on a&nbsp;<strong>software application</strong>&nbsp;that&rsquo;s installed on all the computers on the network</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/03/13141512/blockchain-software-protocol-150x150.png" /></p>
    <p>Think of when you have to make a decision as a group.</p>
    <ol>
    <li>One way to decide is by the &ldquo;<strong>authority</strong>&rdquo; rule where one person makes the decision for the entire group.</li>
    <li>Another way is by &ldquo;<strong>consensus</strong>&rdquo; where each person in the group agrees to support the decision.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The former is how digital ledgers or records of transactions (&ldquo;databases&rdquo;) were maintained and kept accurate PRIOR to the blockchain.</p>
    <p>The latter is the breakthrough that blockchain achieved.</p>
    <p>Imagine thousands of random people (or computers):</p>
    <ul>
    <li>who don&rsquo;t know each other and who don&rsquo;t trust each other&hellip;..</li>
    <li>all agreeing that a&nbsp;<strong>file</strong>&nbsp;containing a history of all transactions is accurate&hellip;.</li>
    <li>without the need of some kind of third-party&nbsp;<strong>middleman</strong>&nbsp;to &ldquo;verify&rdquo; its accuracy.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The genius of blockchain technology is that it&nbsp;<strong>cuts away the middleman</strong>&nbsp;yet maintains an infrastructure that allows strangers to deal with each other.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/08/11215807/cut-out-middleman.png" /></p>
    <p>It does this by taking away the role of &ldquo;I will maintain the ledger.&rdquo; from&nbsp;<strong>central authorities</strong>&nbsp;like banks and handing it to a&nbsp;<strong>network of autonomous computers</strong>&nbsp;where &ldquo;We will all have a copy of the ledger and maintain it together.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>This&nbsp;<strong>transfer of control and decision-making</strong>&nbsp;from a centralized entity (individual, organization, or group) to a distributed network&nbsp;creates a&nbsp;<strong>DECENTRALIZED&nbsp;</strong>system of trust that operates outside the control of any institution.</p>
    <p>That&rsquo;s a crazy accomplishment!</p>
    <p>The blockchain now makes it possible to share and maintain a set of data (like a record of transactions) with many computers that don&rsquo;t trust each other. But the data itself could be trusted to be accurate.</p>
    <p>This had never been done before!</p>
    <p><strong>Blockchain technology is such a life-changing technology that it is now classified as a general-purpose technology, like the steam engine, electricity, computers, the internet, and the selfie.</strong></p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/03/13133456/blockcian-technology.png" /></p>
    <p>Even though blockchain technology&rsquo;s most famous example is Bitcoin, it is now used outside of Bitcoin by other cryptocurrencies.</p>
