    <p>Hello there! üëã</p>
    <p>My name is&nbsp;<strong>Toshi Moshi.</strong></p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/02/16125723/toshi-welcome.png" /></p>
    <p>Welcome to my&nbsp;<strong>School of Crypto</strong>! I will be your friendly guide. üè´</p>
    <p>If you&rsquo;re new to cryptocurrencies, you&rsquo;ve come to the right place! I created this course to make it easier for beginners to&nbsp;<strong>understand the crypto market.</strong></p>
    <p>I provide easy-to-understand information on bitcoin, altcoins, tokens, and the crypto market in general.</p>
    <p>Mainstream awareness of crypto has been gaining momentum. Every day, more and more people jump on the crypto bandwagon whether it&rsquo;s due to a strong passion for the technology&rsquo;s potential to positively impact the future or simply due to FOMO (fear of missing out).</p>
    <p>Along with this increased interest though, has brought an increase in&nbsp;<strong>questionable advice and misinformation</strong>.</p>
    <p>Every day, more and more snake oil salesmen, conmen, shillers, shysters, fraud artists, and other shady folk grace us with their sleazy presence.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/02/16131504/shady-coin-homeless.png" /></p>
    <p>There are&nbsp;<strong>risks</strong>&nbsp;associated with the crypto market, which you need to take time to understand.</p>
    <p>A lot of new traders make the mistake of wanting to get in as fast as they can, hoping to make quick profits and&hellip;. of course&hellip;.get rich quickly!</p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s mind-bogglingly to see so many folks on TikTok, Twitter, and Reddit gambling away their money so they can buy a lambo.</p>
    <p>At BabyPips.com, we encourage a&nbsp;<em>different</em>&nbsp;approach.</p>
    <p>Just like we&rsquo;ve stressed that forex trading is not a get-rich-quick scheme,<strong>&nbsp;you will not hear any get-rich-quick messages from us regarding crypto!</strong></p>
    <p>We strongly encourage that you take a&nbsp;<strong>conservative approach</strong>&nbsp;and only put a SMALL portion of your overall capital that you would use to invest or trade in the financial markets.</p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s no exaggeration when we say that cryptocurrencies are&nbsp;<strong>extremely speculative</strong>. If you&rsquo;re not properly managing your risk, the probability that you&rsquo;ll lose a lot (if not all) of your money is high.</p>
    <p><strong>Caution and care</strong>&nbsp;should be exercised.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/02/16171813/toshi-caution.png" /></p>
    <p><strong>Don&rsquo;t fall for the typical get-rich-quick pitch:</strong></p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry if you don&rsquo;t understand it. The people who do understand say it&rsquo;s going to be massive! It&rsquo;s the next big thing!&rdquo;</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>I disagree.</p>
    <p>YOU do need to understand it.</p>
    <p>I want you to be able to make&nbsp;<strong>informed decisions</strong>, to&nbsp;<strong>intelligently&nbsp;<em>think</em></strong>&nbsp;about exactly what it is that you&rsquo;re buying, and&nbsp;<strong>know what the risks are</strong>&nbsp;and how to properly&nbsp;<strong>manage these risks</strong>.</p>
    <p>In the future, when your grandkids visit you, which do you want to be telling them:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>&ldquo;I missed the boat on crypto.&rdquo;</li>
    <li>&ldquo;I bet your life savings and bought crypto, then lost it all because I didn&rsquo;t really understand what it was all about&hellip;and got suckered by some charismatic scammers&hellip;..which is why I&rsquo;m now single and still living here with your great-grandma.&rdquo;</li>
    </ol>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/07/21110412/old-crypto-trader.png" /></p>
    <p>Hopefully, you will be telling them neither!</p>
    <p><strong>I want to prevent you from becoming a sucker.</strong></p>
    <p>I think it&rsquo;s crucial to at least have a basic understanding of the underlying technology and concepts of cryptocurrencies before plunking down any amount of money.</p>
    <p>My hope is that this course provides a strong foundation for those who are noobs and are just starting their journey into the crypto world.</p>
    <p>By the end of this course, you will be able to decide whether the crypto world is for you.</p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s get started!</p>

    <blockquote>
    <p>Educating yourself is the key to success in trading or investing in crypto. It can mean the difference between generating wealth and losing it all.</p>
