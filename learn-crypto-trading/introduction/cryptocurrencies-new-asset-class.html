    <p>In the previous lesson, you were introduced to&nbsp;<strong>cryptocurrencies</strong>&nbsp;and learned why they&rsquo;re different from traditional currencies.</p>
    <p>Aside from functioning as a new kind of &ldquo;digital money&rdquo; that&rsquo;s used to pay for goods and services, cryptocurrencies are more often used as&nbsp;<strong>financial assets that people trade or invest in</strong>.</p>
    <p>The traditional financial (&ldquo;<strong>TradFi</strong>&rdquo;) industry is still divided on whether crypto should be considered a &ldquo;<strong>financial asset</strong>&rdquo;.</p>
    <p>The popular argument is that they&rsquo;re impossible to value because there are no earnings or dividends, but there are financial assets with similar issues like gold and other commodities.</p>
    <p>I view cryptocurrencies as a financial asset. More broadly, I view cryptocurrencies as a&nbsp;<strong>brand new asset class</strong>. (Currently, a very&nbsp;<em>speculative</em>&nbsp;asset class.)</p>
    <p>Asset classes are categories of investments that have similar characteristics and behave in a similar way such as&nbsp;<strong>stocks</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>bonds</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>commodities</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>real estate</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>cash</strong>&nbsp;(fiat currencies).</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/02/16114521/asset-classes.png" /></p>
    <p>And now there&rsquo;s&hellip;<strong>crypto</strong>!</p>
    <p>Crypto represents the first truly new asset class in&nbsp;<em>decades</em>. ðŸ¤¯</p>
    <p>Rather than just being used as a means of payment, like to pay for food at a restaurant, most cryptocurrencies are used to&nbsp;<strong>make speculative trades</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>held as investments</strong>&nbsp;by people who expect their value to rise.</p>
    <p>Similar to the&nbsp;<strong>forex market</strong>, which is the financial market for&nbsp;<em>fiat</em>&nbsp;currencies, there&rsquo;s now a&nbsp;<strong>crypto market</strong>, a financial market for&nbsp;<em>cryptocurrencies</em>, where both traders and investors can make money.</p>
    <p>But while the forex market is open 24 hours a day, 5.5 days a week, the crypto market is&nbsp;<strong>open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week</strong>. It never closes!</p>
    <p><strong>Traders make bets</strong>&nbsp;(&ldquo;speculate&rdquo;) on short-term price direction, while&nbsp;<strong>investors buy and hold</strong>&nbsp;in hopes that certain cryptocurrencies gain wider user adoption and increase in value over the long term.</p>
    <p>Adding crypto helps investors&nbsp;<strong>diversify their portfolios</strong>. And more experienced crypto investors even&nbsp;<strong>generate passive income</strong>&nbsp;from different cryptocurrencies they hold.</p>
    <p>Since cryptocurrencies are financial assets that you can invest or trade, they&rsquo;re also referred to as &ldquo;<strong>digital assets</strong>&rdquo; or &ldquo;<strong>cryptoassets</strong>&rdquo; or &ldquo;<strong>crypto assets</strong>&ldquo;.</p>
    <h2>Examples of Crypto</h2>
    <p>The first cryptocurrency was&nbsp;<strong>Bitcoin</strong>&nbsp;and it remains the biggest and most well-known.</p>
    <p>There are also other well-known cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, Cardano, Solana, Dogecoin, Polkadot, Litecoin, Cosmos, and many others.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/02/21153121/other-cryptocurrencies.png" /></p>
    <p>Some are similar to Bitcoin. Others are based on different technologies, or have new features that make them totally different from Bitcoin.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>The term &ldquo;cryptocurrency&rdquo; is actually&nbsp;<strong>misleading</strong>&nbsp;because, unlike Bitcoin, most cryptocurrencies do not function as actual currencies.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Today, there are now THOUSANDS of cryptocurrencies that have been created, with each trying to offer new or improved functionalities from earlier cryptocurrencies or to serve a totally different purpose or use case.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, many are actually useless or even worse, outright scams, but a lot of people still buy them.</p>
    <p>Gullible noobs entering the crypto world hear about &ldquo;A coin that will not only change the world but change the galaxy!&rdquo;</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/02/16154624/galaticoin.png" /></p>
    <p>They think: &ldquo;I must buy this&nbsp;<strong>Galaticoin</strong>!&rdquo;</p>
    <p>They buy the dubious coin and give away their money without understanding the underlying technology.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2019/02/26172550/buy-galaticoin-no-fomo-287x360.png" /></p>
    <p>The cryptocurrency ends up being worthless.</p>
    <p>Some people are jumping into the crypto market with the wrong mentality. They believe that it&rsquo;s a&nbsp;<strong>sure bet</strong>&hellip;.that the money they put in will just automatically grow.</p>
    <p>With this mentality, it&rsquo;s not surprising why a scam artist or shiller sees today&rsquo;s cryptocurrency market like how a tiger sees a herd of one-legged deer.</p>
    <p>Lots of&nbsp;<em>delicious</em>&nbsp;opportunities.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/02/16124644/one-legged-deer.png" /></p>
    <p>Don&rsquo;t be a one-legged deer.</p>
    <p>That&rsquo;s my mission&hellip;</p>
    <p><strong>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let you become a one-legged deer.&rdquo;</strong></p>
    <p>Who am I exactly?</p>
