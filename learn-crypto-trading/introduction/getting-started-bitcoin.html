    <p>Today, there are&nbsp;<strong>thousands</strong>&nbsp;of different cryptocurrencies out in the crypto market.</p>
    <p>And when prices have surged in the past, the total value of all these cryptocurrencies has exceeded&nbsp;<strong>$2.9 trillion,&nbsp;</strong>with daily trading volume of over $130 billion<strong>.&nbsp;</strong></p>
    <p>In other words, the crypto market has grown rapidly and it&rsquo;s now pretty big. (But still nowhere as huge as the forex market.)</p>
    <p>For crypto noobs, just trying to figure out where to begin can feel overwhelming. ðŸ˜…</p>
    <p>So rather than try to learn about the entire crypto market all at once, and get overwhelmed, I&rsquo;m going to start with&nbsp;<strong>Bitcoin</strong>.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/02/20104932/bitcoin-yay.png" /></p>
    <p>Since Bitcoin was the original cryptocurrency,<strong>&nbsp;the technical breakthroughs that allowed Bitcoin to emerge underlie all other cryptocurrencies</strong>.</p>
    <p>Understanding Bitcoin, like what it is, where it came from, and how it works provides a solid foundation for being able to navigate the entire crypto space.</p>
    <p>Many of the concepts needed to understand Bitcoin can be&nbsp;<strong>applied to other cryptocurrencies</strong>.</p>
    <p>So if you can get a firm enough grasp of Bitcoin to not be mystified by the topic&hellip;.which is my aim&hellip;.then&nbsp;<strong>you will have a much easier time understanding the rest of the crypto world</strong>.</p>
    <p>I will start with a gentle introduction to Bitcoin and assume you have little to no technical knowledge.</p>
    <h2>What is Bitcoin?</h2>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s start with a very simple description of Bitcoin&hellip;.</p>
    <div>
    <p>Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency, based on an open-source software design, that is used to transmit value between pseudonymous users.</p>
    <p>All transactions, after being confirmed by miners using PoW as the consensus mechanism, are stored on a distributed ledger, called a blockchain.</p>
    </div>
    <div>Changes to the blockchain are append-only and are synchronized about every10 minutes across thousands of nodes located all over the world over a P2P network. All information stored on the blockchain can be viewed publicly, in real-time.</div>
    <div>Cryptographic techniques such as public-key cryptography, hash functions, and digital signatures are used to keep the blockchain secure and immutable so it can be accessible to everybody but hackable to nobody.</div>
    <p>Got all that? ðŸ¤”</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2019/02/27160006/toshi-jargon-overload.png" /></p>
    <p>I&rsquo;m kidding!</p>
    <p>But give yourself a pat on the back for actually reading all that and not scrolling past it. (You didn&rsquo;t scroll past it, right? ðŸ‘€)</p>
    <p><strong>Have no fear. Do NOT be intimidated or discouraged.</strong></p>
    <p>This is the BEGINNER&rsquo;S guide to Bitcoin and we assume zero technical knowledge.</p>
    <p>So this is NOT really how we&rsquo;re going to start learning about Bitcoin.</p>
    <p>But as you can clearly see,&nbsp;<strong>the crypto world is full of technical jargon</strong>!</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/02/16140629/crypto-jargon.png" /></p>
    <p>Jumping into crypto introduces a large number of terms that most people will be unfamiliar with.</p>
    <p>The crypto world seems to&nbsp;<strong>have its own language</strong>&nbsp;and those wishing to learn about the topic can quickly become overwhelmed with all the jargon, acronyms, and other technical terms.</p>
    <p>But if you really want to understand cryptocurrencies and how they are different, it&rsquo;s really important that you do familiarize yourself with certain&nbsp;<strong>core foundational concepts</strong>.</p>
    <p>My goal is to cover terms and phrases that you may initially not know, but do&nbsp;<strong>need to know</strong>.</p>
    <p>Together, we will blast jargon into smithereens so you&rsquo;re able to easily&nbsp;<strong>speak the language of the crypto world</strong>&nbsp;with ease.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/02/16134311/jargon-blaster.png"  /></p>
    <p>I&rsquo;ve also found a lot of&nbsp;<strong>inconsistencies</strong>&nbsp;in how certain terms are used or defined on the interwebz.</p>
    <p>I want to establish a&nbsp;<strong>common vocabulary</strong>&nbsp;with clear definitions of concepts and terms.</p>
    <p>This will help make sure that every time a buzzword or jargon phrase appears throughout our course, it is used consistently and correctly.</p>
    <p>I can&rsquo;t stress enough the importance of learning the concepts behind all this&nbsp;<del>ridiculous</del>&nbsp;wonderful jargon.</p>
    <p>How else will you impress your dinner date or wow a crowd at cocktail parties?</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/02/16161047/crypto-party.png" /></p>
    <p>Do you give a nervous smile or chuckle when someone mentions crypto because you&rsquo;re clueless?</p>
    <p>Those days will soon be over.</p>
    <p>By the end of this course, you WILL be able to understand the geeky definition of Bitcoin that I wrote earlier in this lesson. ðŸ¤“</p>
    <p>(If you scrolled past it earlier, scroll back up!)</p>
    <p>You&rsquo;ll be knowledgeable enough to be able to approach unfamiliar crypto terminology with confidence.</p>
    <p>You&rsquo;ll go from &ldquo;crypto clueless&rdquo; to &ldquo;crypto competent&rdquo;. ðŸ’ª</p>
    <p>Now back to Bitcoin&hellip;.</p>
