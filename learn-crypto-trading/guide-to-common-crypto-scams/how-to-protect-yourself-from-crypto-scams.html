    <h2>8 Tips to Protect Yourself from Crypto Scams</h2>
    <p>Here are 8 helpful tips you can take to protect yourself from crypto scams.</p>
    <h3>1. Never share your wallet&rsquo;s seed phrase.</h3>
    <p>If you are asked to share the seed phrase&nbsp;of your crypto wallet, to participate in an investment opportunity, or to &ldquo;restore&rdquo; or &ldquo;load&rdquo; your account, it&rsquo;s a scam to steal your holdings.</p>
    <p>Don&rsquo;t fall for it!</p>
    <p>Never share your seed phrase or private keys with anyone. Even if yo mama asks for it.</p>

    <p>And remember to keep your seed phrase in a safe place.</p>
    <h3>2. Do your own research.</h3>
    <p>If you&rsquo;re unfamiliar with a cryptocurrency and don&rsquo;t know what makes it unique, do your homework.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/05/07101654/do-your-own-research-shitcoin-360x360.png" /></p>
    <p>Search online using the company name as well as the cryptocurrency name, and add &ldquo;<strong>review</strong>,&rdquo; &ldquo;<strong>scam</strong>,&rdquo; or &ldquo;<strong>complaint</strong>&rdquo; to your search.</p>
    <p>Pay attention to the results and don&rsquo;t just skim the content. Online reviews may have come from fake profiles.</p>
    <p>Always do your own research (<strong>DYOR</strong>) before you risk any money.</p>
    <h3>3. Ignore urgent requests.</h3>
    <p>Scammers try to use high-pressure tactics to get you to send your money quickly.</p>
    <p>For example, they may offer discounts or bonuses if you act now. Or they may pretend to be a friend in an emergency who needs money sent as crypto.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/05/07132114/urgent-message-scam-360x341.png" /></p>
    <p>Watch for heavy sales pitches to &ldquo;Invest now!&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s probably a &ldquo;pump and dump&rdquo; scam.</p>
    <p>Urgent payment requests are a big warning sign. If you receive these types of requests, just&nbsp;<strong>delete the messages and ignore them</strong>.</p>
    <h3>4. Be suspicious of social media posts.</h3>
    <p>Social media is the most profitable method used by scammers than&nbsp;<em>any other method</em>&nbsp;of reaching people.</p>
    <p>Crypto scammers often use social networking apps like Twitter or chat apps like Telegram and Discord to promote their scams.</p>
    <p>They may claim that influencers or celebrities endorse or support their projects, or are even investors. Posts may include photos or screenshots. But this is all fake and all lies.&nbsp;Do not believe the hype.</p>
    <p>When&hellip;not if, you see the heavy promotion of a new cryptocurrency or other crypto projects on social media, be skeptical and DYOR.</p>
    <p>And if someone appears on your social media and rushes you to start a friendship or romance, watch out! Be aware of romance scams.</p>
    <h3>5. Ignore random DMs.</h3>
    <p>If you get a random direct message (&ldquo;DM&rdquo;) from a stranger who is trying to pitch you a crypto investment &ldquo;opportunity&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s a scam.</p>
    <p>Never transfer your crypto or provide any personal information to anybody who makes unsolicited contact with you.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/05/07131147/random-text-message-scams-360x341.png" /></p>
    <p>Even if it&rsquo;s not a total stranger and you know the person, remain suspicious.</p>
    <p>Either that person has been convinced by a scammer and is now trying to get&nbsp;<em>you</em>&nbsp;to participate OR their phone, email, or social media account has been hacked and the hacker is impersonating your friend.</p>
    <h3>6. Make sure the website address is correct.</h3>
    <p>When visiting a crypto-related website, always&nbsp;<strong>double-check the website&rsquo;s address</strong>&nbsp;(&ldquo;URL&rdquo;) before entering your information.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/05/07102131/website-url-360x360.png" /></p>
    <p>If you&rsquo;re unfamiliar with a cryptocurrency&rsquo;s website, get the URL from an official source, such as the cryptocurrency&rsquo;s official Twitter account.</p>
    <p>You can also use well-known&nbsp;<strong>price-tracking websites</strong>&nbsp;for cryptocurrencies such as CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko. Simply search for the specific cryptocurrency and look for the link to their official website.</p>
    <p>Whenever you receive ANY messages, whether via email, text, chat, or DM,&nbsp;<strong>always check the spelling of the URLs in any links</strong>&nbsp;before you click! And&nbsp;<strong>watch out for URL redirects</strong>, where you&rsquo;re subtly sent to a different website with a similar design.</p>
    <h3>7. Download apps from official mobile app distribution platforms.</h3>
    <p>When using crypto mobile apps, only download from official mobile app distribution platforms, also known as &ldquo;app stores&rdquo;.</p>
    <p>For iOS devices, this would be the&nbsp;<strong>Apple App Store</strong>. For Android devices, this would be the&nbsp;<strong>Google Play Store</strong>.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/05/07102657/app-stores-360x217.png" /></p>
    <p>If you&rsquo;re asked to download a mobile app outside the App Store or Google Play Store, which is known as &rdquo;&nbsp;<strong>sideloading</strong>&ldquo;,</p>
    <p>I highly recommend against it. These apps have NOT been reviewed by Apple or Google.</p>
    <p>For example, you could be downloading and installing a fake mobile wallet. Once you send any crypto into this wallet, it will be immediately transferred to a wallet that definitely won&rsquo;t be yours.</p>
    <p>Be leery of requests to download apps to fix issues or that allow access to your device.</p>
    <h3>8. Avoid anything with &ldquo;promises&rdquo; or &ldquo;guarantees&rdquo;.</h3>
    <p>If someone &ldquo;promises&rdquo; high returns, that&rsquo;s a scam.</p>
    <p>And if they &ldquo;guarantee&rdquo; returns, that&rsquo;s also a scam.</p>
    <p>But if they promise and guarantee high returns with zero risk, that&rsquo;s legit.</p>
    <p>I&rsquo;m kidding! Of course, that&rsquo;s a scam!</p>
    <p>Legitimate investments that can guarantee high returns with no risk do not exist. You&rsquo;re better off trying to find a pot of gold at the end of a rainbow.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/05/07100757/pot-of-gold-360x360.png" /></p>
    <p>See glowing testimonials or awesome-sounding success stories? They&rsquo;re probably fake.</p>
    <p><strong>If something sounds too good to be true, it is.</strong></p>
