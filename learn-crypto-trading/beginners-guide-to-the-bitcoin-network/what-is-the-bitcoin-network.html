    <p>What is the Bitcoin network?</p>
    <p>The Bitcoin network is a&nbsp;<strong>peer-to-peer (P2P) network</strong>.</p>
    <p>From the words of the Bitcoin God himself:</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;A purely&nbsp;<strong>peer-to-peer</strong>&nbsp;version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.&rdquo;</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The&nbsp;<strong>Bitcoin network</strong>&nbsp;is made up of computers running the&nbsp;<strong>Bitcoin software</strong>&nbsp;(also known as a&nbsp;<strong>Bitcoin client</strong>).</p>
    <p>The software running is what makes the whole thing work.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/02/17193409/bitcoin-client-on-network.png" /></p>
    <p>Any computer on the Bitcoin network can &ldquo;talk&rdquo; with each other&nbsp;<strong>directly</strong>.</p>
    <p>This is different from a client-server network where every computer on the network must first go through a central server.</p>
    <p>In the real world, P2P networks don&rsquo;t look as pretty and organized as above. Not every computer can connect directly with each other because&hellip;.the world is too big.</p>
    <p>So let&rsquo;s keep it real&hellip;.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/02/17193555/bitcoin-client-on-network-realistic.png" /></p>
    <p>Since there is no central server in a P2P network, it is a&nbsp;<strong>decentralized</strong>&nbsp;network.</p>
    <h2>Centralized vs. Decentralized Network</h2>
    <p>A decentralized network consists of &ldquo;peers&rdquo; that can run&nbsp;<em>independently</em>&nbsp;of each other.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/02/22125958/decentralized-vs-centralized-network.png" /></p>
    <p>Why does this matter?</p>
    <p>There are two main reasons:</p>
    <h3>1. No Central Point of Failure</h3>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/02/17193858/central-point-of-failure-360x341.png" /></p>
    <p>If one computer goes down, the network&nbsp;<strong>continues to run</strong>&nbsp;like it never existed. This is different from a centralized network.</p>
    <p>In a centralized network configuration, like the client-server network, if the central server goes down,&nbsp;<strong>the&nbsp;<em>entire</em>&nbsp;network goes down with it</strong>.</p>
    <p>This means that the&nbsp;<strong>Bitcoin network can not be shut down</strong>. Because there is no &ldquo;server&rdquo; to take down.</p>
    <p>Each computer on the Bitcoin network is&nbsp;<strong>independent</strong>. If one fails, the network will still run successfully.</p>
    <h3>2. Decentralized Consensus</h3>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/02/17193947/decentralized-consensus.png" /></p>
    <p>When using electronic money to make a payment, like with a bank transfer from your checking account, your transaction has to go through a trusted &ldquo;middleman&rdquo; or third party to settle the transaction by deducting funds from one account and adding them to another.</p>
    <p>If this middleman settles the transaction, then the transaction is considered valid.</p>
    <p>If I transferred you some money, you and I&nbsp;<em>agree</em>&nbsp;the money has actually transferred from my account to yours because&nbsp;<strong>we relied on a trusted intermediary or central authority</strong>&hellip;..the bank.</p>
    <p>So in this case, &ldquo;consensus&rdquo; on whether the transaction is valid requires&nbsp;<strong>centralization</strong>.</p>
    <p>Bitcoin is different. It uses&nbsp;<strong>decentralized consensus</strong>.</p>
    <p>The idea is that instead of relying on an intermediary, ALL the computers on the Bitcoin network have to come to an agreement by &ldquo;<strong>consensus</strong>&rdquo; on which transactions are valid.</p>
    <p>Basically,&nbsp;<strong>the middleman is replaced by a network of computers</strong>.</p>
    <p><em>HOW&nbsp;</em>all of these computers actually come to a consensus will be explained in a later lesson.</p>
    <p>For now, let&rsquo;s take a look at how the Bitcoin network works.</p>
