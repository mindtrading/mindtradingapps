    <p>Instead of a governing body or central organization (like a bank) managing transactions, Bitcoin is run by a&nbsp;<strong>network</strong>&nbsp;made up of thousands of computers running some software that handles the sending and receiving of bitcoins.</p>
    <p>This network of computers is called the&nbsp;<strong>Bitcoin network</strong>.</p>
    <p>Before we dig deeper into the details of the actual Bitcoin network, let&rsquo;s take a step back first and review what a &ldquo;network&rdquo; is.</p>
    <h2>What is a network?</h2>
    <p>What&rsquo;s a network? Or more specifically, what&rsquo;s a&nbsp;<em>computer</em>&nbsp;network?</p>
    <p>A&nbsp;<strong>network</strong>&nbsp;is just a bunch of computers linked together allowing them to exchange data with each other.</p>
    <p>There are two basic ways a network can be arranged:</p>
    <h3>1. Client-Server Network</h3>
    <p>The first type of network is known as a&nbsp;<strong>&ldquo;client-server network</strong>&rdquo;.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/02/17192841/client-server-network-1.png"  /></p>
    <p>A client-server network is when there is one centralized computer (called the &ldquo;server&rdquo;) that acts as a hub to which other computers (called &ldquo;clients&rdquo;) are connected.</p>
    <p>Data is requested by computers known as &ldquo;<strong>clients</strong>&rdquo; (such as PCs or even smartphones) and are served by computers called &ldquo;<strong>servers</strong>&rdquo;.</p>
    <p>This is the type of network configuration used by banks and popular payment apps like PayPal, Venmo, Apple Pay, and Google Pay.</p>
    <p>In conventional digital banking, your laptop or mobile phone acts as an electronic &ldquo;client&rdquo; interacting with a central server operated by your bank.</p>
    <p>This &ldquo;<strong>hub-and-spoke</strong>&rdquo; network configuration is highly efficient but it&rsquo;s fragile since the server is a &ldquo;chokepoint&rdquo; and becomes a centralized single point of failure (&ldquo;SPOF&rdquo;).</p>
    <p><strong>If the server goes down, the&nbsp;<em>entire</em>&nbsp;network goes down.</strong></p>
    <h2>2. Peer-to-Peer Network (P2P)</h2>
    <p>The second type of network is known as a &ldquo;<strong>peer-to-peer network</strong>&rdquo;.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/02/17193005/p2p-network.png" /></p>
    <p>Where&rsquo;s the &ldquo;server&rdquo;? There is none.</p>
    <p>Instead of &ldquo;servers&rdquo; and &ldquo;clients&rdquo;, computers are simply known as &ldquo;<strong>nodes</strong>&rdquo; since they can function as both client AND server.</p>
    <p>A&nbsp;<strong>peer-to-peer network,</strong>&nbsp;also known as a&nbsp;<strong>P2P network</strong>, is created when two or more computers are connected and e<strong>xchange data with each other without going through a separate &ldquo;server&rdquo; computer</strong>.</p>
    <p>In a P2P network, computers are able to &ldquo;talk&rdquo; to each other&nbsp;<strong>directly</strong>.</p>
    <p>Instead of a &ldquo;hub-and-spoke&rdquo; configuration, a P2P network is structured like a &ldquo;s<strong>pider web</strong>&rdquo;.</p>
    <p>A popular example of a P2P network is the&nbsp;<strong>internet</strong>&nbsp;itself.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>For folks with a tad bit of gray hair, you may have remembered a famous music-sharing software called Napster. Napster deserves credit for popularizing the use of software that runs on a P2P network. BitTorrent is another one.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In a peer-to-peer network:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Everyone is&nbsp;<strong>connected to each other</strong>, so it&rsquo;s a&nbsp;<em>network</em>.</li>
    <li>Everyone on the network is&nbsp;<strong>equal</strong>, so they are all considered peers.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each peer is equal to the others, and each peer has the same rights and duties as the others. Peers are both clients AND servers&nbsp;<em>at the same time</em>.</p>
    <p>What the heck does this have to do with Bitcoin?</p>
    <p>Remember&hellip;Bitcoin runs on a computer network which is known as the&nbsp;<strong>Bitcoin network</strong>.</p>
    <p>And it&rsquo;s configured as a peer-to-peer (P2P) network!</p>
    <p>Why is this important?</p>
    <p>In the next lesson, I&rsquo;ll explain why. ðŸ¤”</p>
