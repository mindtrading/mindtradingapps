    <p>What does the Bitcoin network do?</p>
    <p>As mentioned in the previous lesson,&nbsp;the Bitcoin network is made up of&nbsp;<strong>computers</strong>&nbsp;running the Bitcoin&nbsp;<strong>software.&nbsp;</strong>These computers or &ldquo;machines&rdquo; are&nbsp;known as Bitcoin&nbsp;<strong>nodes</strong>.</p>
    <p>Bitcoins nodes&nbsp;<strong><em>gossip</em></strong>. They love to talk to each other.</p>
    <p>But instead of talking about recent drama from the Kardashians, they communicate about what&rsquo;s going on around the network.</p>
    <p>This is done by sending each other&nbsp;<em>messages</em>.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/02/17194831/bitcoin-network-message.png" /></p>
    <p>In Bitcoin&rsquo;s case, each message contains information about a new&nbsp;<strong>transaction</strong>.</p>
    <p>Nodes&nbsp;<strong>form a network</strong>&nbsp;by connecting and sharing transactions with one another.</p>
    <p>This sharing of&nbsp;<strong>information</strong>&nbsp;(&ldquo;transaction data&rdquo;) is what allows all the computers on the network to stay up-to-date, which is pretty important if you want to run a digital currency on the internet.</p>

    <h2>Who is part of the Bitcoin network?</h2>
    <p><strong>Any computer</strong>&nbsp;that is running a Bitcoin client software is part of the network.</p>
    <p>Got an active Internet connection?&nbsp;Then you can join.&nbsp;<strong>Anybody can join the Bitcoin network!</strong></p>
    <p>Aside from an internet connection, you&rsquo;ll just need to download and install the&nbsp;<strong>software</strong>&nbsp;(Bitcoin client) and let the application run on your computer all day long.</p>
    <p>Once it&rsquo;s up and running, the computer will be known as a Bitcoin &ldquo;<strong>node</strong>&rdquo; on the Bitcoin network.</p>
    <p>There are no jocks or mean girls who will bully you and try to keep you out. Got a Bitcoin client software up and running on your computer? Welcome to the cool club. You now got node status yo.</p>
    <p>In computer geek lingo, a &ldquo;<strong>client</strong>&rdquo; is a piece of hardware or software that connects to a server.</p>
    <p>For example, an internet browser like Google Chrome or Apple Safari is a &ldquo;client&rdquo; since it connects to a website&rsquo;s server to request its content</p>
    <p>In the context of Bitcoin,&nbsp;<strong>a client is a software that connects to other clients in a<em>&nbsp;peer-to-peer</em>&nbsp;manner</strong>.</p>
    <p>Because all these clients talk to&nbsp;<strong>each other</strong>, they form a network where&nbsp;<strong>each client is a node</strong>. There is no Bitcoin &ldquo;server&rdquo; for Bitcoin clients to connect to. Every Bitcoin client is, at the same, a&nbsp;<em>server</em>&nbsp;also.</p>
    <p>To avoid confusion, this is why the term &ldquo;<strong>node</strong>&rdquo; is typically used in place of &ldquo;client&rdquo;.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/02/17195207/bitcoin-network-of-nodes.png" /></p>
    <p>The Bitcoin network is just a bunch of&nbsp;<strong>connected nodes</strong>&nbsp;from all over the globe. And there are over 15,000 of them!</p>
    <p>Here&rsquo;s a map showing the geographical distribution of Bitcoin nodes:</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/03/02094729/map-bitcoin-nodes-1-780x471.jpg" /></p>
    <p>When you read Bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies) described as being &ldquo;<em>managed by peer-to-peer networks of computers running software</em>,&rdquo; this is what they mean.</p>
    <p>Think of the Bitcoin network as a&nbsp;<strong>leaderless network</strong>&nbsp;of independent computers (&ldquo;nodes&rdquo;) that operate autonomously based on the Bitcoin software.</p>
