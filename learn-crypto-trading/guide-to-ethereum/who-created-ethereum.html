    <p>Who created Ethereum?</p>
    <p>The answer is complicated but the simple answer is a bunch of folks.</p>
    <p>The &ldquo;idea&rdquo; of Ethereum originated from then 19-year-old&nbsp;<strong>Vitalik Buterin</strong>, computer programmer and co-founder of Bitcoin Magazine who REALLLY wanted more use cases for blockchain technology than supporting cryptocurrencies.</p>
    <p>So, in November 2013 Buterin leveled up his &ldquo;Ultimate Scripting&rdquo; project and introduced &ldquo;Ethereum&rdquo; via a whitepaper:</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>What this project intends to do is take cryptocurrency 2.0, and generalize it &ndash; create a fully-fledged, Turing-complete (but heavily fee-regulated) cryptographic ledger that allows participants to encode arbitrarily complex contracts, autonomous agents and relationships that will be mediated entirely by the blockchain.</p>
    <p>On-chain currencies, futures contracts, prediction markets, Namecoin-style domain name systems and even provably fair gambling sites will become trivial to implement, existing as simple, hundred-line-of-code contracts on the chain.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>But Buterin didn&rsquo;t have a solid computer language yet, let alone a Turing-complete one. He also hadn&rsquo;t formed a team to build the project with.</p>
    <p>In true geek fashion, our boy got the first supporters and used the &ldquo;greedy algorithm&rdquo; to recruit the rest of the &ldquo;first five&rdquo; co-founders:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Mihai Alisie</strong>&nbsp;who also co-founded Bitcoin Magazine</li>
    <li><strong>Anthony Di Iorio</strong>&nbsp;who founded the Toronto Bitcoin Meetup Group (TBMG), where he met Vitalik Buterin. Currently, he is the founder and CEO of Decentral Inc.</li>
    <li><strong>Amir Chetrit</strong>&nbsp;who worked on the Colored Coins project where he met Buterin</li>
    <li><strong>Charles Hoskinson</strong>&nbsp;who made content for The Bitcoin Education Project and TBMG and knew Di Iorio. And is the founder of Cardano.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>And then the founding team quickly expanded to eight to include a few key players:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Gavin Wood,</strong>&nbsp;a computer scientist who got in touch with Buterin after reading Ethereum&rsquo;s whitepaper. Mr. Wood is a serial entrepreneur who has also founded the Web3 Foundation and Polkadot, among many other projects.</li>
    <li><strong>Jeffrey Wilcke</strong>&nbsp;was a core developer of Mastercoin, one of the projects that inspired the Ethereum network. Currently the co-founder of Grid Games.</li>
    <li><strong>Joseph Lubin</strong>&nbsp;also knew Di Iorio from TBMG which was then renamed the Bitcoin Alliance of Canada. Lubin is currently the CEO and co-founder at ConsenSys, an Ethereum software company most well known for the MetaMask wallet.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The gang lucked out with Dr. Gavin Wood, who not only helped Buterin with his C++ but was also responsible for shifting the project&rsquo;s vision from &ldquo;programmable money that&rsquo;s moved around by contracts&rdquo; to a more general-purpose computing platform.</p>
    <p>He also conceptualized&nbsp;<strong>Solidity</strong>, the actual programming language that runs Ethereum.</p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s thanks to Solidity that developers can create dApps, design smart contracts, and launch Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) on Ethereum.</p>
    <p>I guess you could say that Gavin Wood did the team&hellip; a solid. ity.</p>
    <p>No wonder Wood left out everyone else&rsquo;s names when he wrote Ethereum&rsquo;s &ldquo;Yellow Paper&rdquo; in April 2014.</p>
    <p>His groupmates be slackin&rsquo;!</p>
    <p>Kidding.</p>
    <p>Other members were busy doing other things including establishing the Swiss-based nonprofit Ethereum Foundation in June 2014 so that it could oversee the first-ever Ether sale.</p>
    <p>The 42-day &ldquo;presale&rdquo; that ended in September 2014 netted a cool 31,591 BTC, which translated to&nbsp;<strong>$18,439,08</strong>6 at the time in exchange for about&nbsp;<strong>60,102,216 ETH</strong>.</p>
    <p>Funding secured!</p>
    <p>The presale gains went into development and in July 2015, the team launched the Frontier network where miners were able to load and generate the Ethereum Genesis block.</p>
    <p>A few months later, prediction markets protocol&nbsp;<strong>Augur</strong>&nbsp;ran the first-ever&nbsp;<strong>initial coin offering (ICO)</strong>&nbsp;on the Ethereum blockchain and raised over $5 million in 45 days.</p>
    <h2>The DAO Hack and Ethereum Fork</h2>
    <p>All was going well in Ethereum-ville until 2016 when an attacker exploited a vulnerability in a popular (but unrefined) smart contract.</p>
    <p>It was German startup Slock.it that developed a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) creatively called &ldquo;The DAO.&rdquo; The project promised to use the ETH it would raise in its sale to fund Uber and Airbnb-like projects with ETH. In return, token holders get to vote on which proposals to fund and possibly receive dividends.</p>
    <p>The DAO became wildly popular and raised over 11.5 million ETH within a 27-day crowd sale. That was more than $150 million and 16% of all Ether supply!</p>
    <p>But The DAO&rsquo;s smart contract &ndash; not the Ethereum network &ndash; had loopholes and with a lot of moolah on the line, a &ldquo;hacker&rdquo; was able to siphon $50 million worth of ETH from the project&rsquo;s Ethereum address and into a &ldquo;child DAO.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>The amount of ETH tied to the project and the hits that Ethereum&rsquo;s rep took led to the Ethereum Foundation stepping in.</p>
    <p>Will it stick to the &ldquo;code is law&rdquo; principle and let the attacker get away with its gains? Or will it make an exception to the &ldquo;too big to fail&rdquo; project and &ldquo;undo&rdquo; the attacker&rsquo;s hack?</p>
    <p>After a civil war among Ethereum community k̶e̶y̶b̶o̶a̶r̶d̶ ̶w̶a̶r̶r̶i̶o̶r̶s members, a hard fork was eventually implemented. Ethereum&rsquo;s blockchain splintered into one with the DAO hack and one without.</p>
    <p>The blockchain with the OG code that allowed the DAO hack to remain a part of its history became known as&nbsp;<strong>Ethereum Classic (ETC)</strong>, while the blockchain that reversed the hack and returned the &ldquo;stolen&rdquo; ETH is what many now call the&nbsp;<strong>Ethereum (ETH)</strong>&nbsp;blockchain.</p>
    <h2>The Merge</h2>
    <p>The DAO hack wasn&rsquo;t the first drama in the Ethereum project, and it won&rsquo;t be the last. These days, the project is focused on &rdquo;&nbsp;<strong>The Merge&rdquo;.</strong></p>
    <p>The Merge involves the &ldquo;merging&rdquo; of the Ethereum main chain with the &ldquo;Beacon Chain&rdquo;, a brand-new, proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain. When this occurs, Ethereum will be one step closer to achieving the full scale, security, and sustainability outlined in its Ethereum vision.</p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s the Ethereum Foundation funding multiple research and development teams that will facilitate the transition to The Merge. Among the OG founders,&nbsp;<strong>only Buterin remains active in Ethereum&rsquo;s development</strong>.</p>
