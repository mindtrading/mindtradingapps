    <p>Ethereum is known as a &ldquo;<strong>smart contract platform</strong>&ldquo;.</p>
<p>A&nbsp;<strong>platform</strong>&nbsp;(or computing platform) is an operating environment in which a piece of software, like programs or applications, can be run (or &ldquo;executed&rdquo;).</p>
<p>But what the heck is a&nbsp;<strong>smart contract</strong>?</p>
<h2>What is a Smart Contract?</h2>
<p><strong>Smart contracts are automated computer programs that are hosted and executed on a blockchain.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/08/07174222/smart-contract-code.png"  /></p>
<p>Despite its name, &ldquo;smart contracts&rdquo; aren&rsquo;t necessarily smart or legally binding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Automated</em>&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;smart&rdquo; and &ldquo;<em>program</em>&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;contract&rdquo; would&rsquo;ve been a better name, but I&rsquo;m not the genius who came up with the concept!</p>
<p><strong>Nick Szabo</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; who coined the term in the late 90&rsquo;s &ndash; compared smart contracts to a vending machine.</p>
<p>Users insert coins into the machine and, assuming the inserted amount is correct, the machine &ldquo;<strong>self-executes</strong>&rdquo; and delivers the goods they requested. Nobody else was involved but you and the vending machine. No third-party involvement was required. Not even the vending machine owner.</p>
<p>The interaction requires little to no trust: the vending machine has no choice but to deliver the goods upon receiving the money.</p>
<p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/08/08130304/smart-contract-vending-machine-exanoke.png" /></p>
<p>Now imagine writing agreements that have terms as clear and predictable as a vending machine and then using blockchain technology to automatically implement the terms of an agreement between parties.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what a smart contract does.</p>
<p>In Ethereum, smart contracts are bits of coded instructions submitted onto the blockchain so that network participants can enforce and store these contracts in a secure and trustless manner.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In slightly more technical terms, a smart contract is a collection of&nbsp;<strong>code and data</strong>&nbsp;that resides at a specific address on Ethereum&rsquo;s blockchain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Smart contracts are also&nbsp;<strong>deterministic</strong>&nbsp;so that those involved in the contract know what results to expect when the contract is executed.</p>
<p>Think of a smart contract as a software program on the blockchain that automatically executes when predetermined conditions are met.</p>
<p>These predetermined conditions, directly written into<strong>&nbsp;lines of code,&nbsp;</strong>are the equivalent of the &ldquo;terms of agreement&rdquo; in a traditional contract.</p>
<p>Now that you know what smart contracts are, let me introduce you to what makes Ethereum a smart contract platform.</p>
<h2>What is EVM?</h2>
<p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/08/17121725/evm-360x360.png" /></p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s not a new type of electronic music.</p>
<p>If smart contracts are instructions written in code, it&rsquo;s the&nbsp;<strong>Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)</strong>&nbsp;that executes them on the Ethereum blockchain.</p>
<p>A &ldquo;<strong>virtual machine</strong>&rdquo; is a piece of software that behaves like an actual physical computer that can run programs and deploy apps.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically a software program on a physical computer that works like it is a&nbsp;<strong>separate computer inside the main computer</strong>.</p>
<p>Why is a &ldquo;separate computer&rdquo; needed to execute smart contracts (which are just computer programs)?</p>
<p>Since not every Ethereum node (which are just computers) uses the same hardware, operating system (OS), and other settings, you need a way to &ldquo;abstract&rdquo; all this out so the code of the smart contract can just run without having to deal with all the different types of computer configurations with their specific requirements.</p>
<p>Otherwise, you&rsquo;d have to write a different version of the smart contract for each type of computer configuration! ðŸ‘Ž</p>
<p>Smart contracts don&rsquo;t want to deal with all this drama! It wants to be device-agnostic and OS-agnostic.</p>
<p>This is where the EVM comes in. ðŸ’ª</p>
<p>It provides an&nbsp;<strong>execution environment</strong>&nbsp;for smart contracts, meaning a smart contract can execute (&ldquo;run&rdquo;) in&nbsp;<em>any</em>&nbsp;environment (&ldquo;any computer or operating system&rdquo;).</p>
<p>Developers can write a smart contract and be sure that it follows the software industry standard practice of &ldquo;Write once, run anywhere&rdquo; (WORA), also known as &ldquo;Write once, run everywhere&rdquo; (WORE).</p>
<p>Basically, a smart contract is will run on any computer with an EVM, Cool huh?</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not the only cool thing.</p>
<p>Since the EVM&rsquo;s purpose is to be<strong>&nbsp;the computation engine embedded in all full Ethereum nodes.&nbsp;</strong>it is&nbsp;<strong>Turing-complete.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>In computer-speak, &ldquo;<strong>Turing-complete&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;means that EVM can theoretically compute anything you can think of computing.</p>
<p>So, in theory, ANY computer application can be programmed and run on the Ethereum platform!</p>
<p>Smart contracts are written in code using high-level programming languages like Solidity, Vyper, or Serpent.</p>
<p>This code gets compiled to something called &ldquo;bytecode&rdquo; by the EVM which then gets deployed to the Ethereum blockchain</p>
<p>Thanks to EVM, the Ethereum blockchain can go beyond smart contracts and can be used to create&nbsp;<strong>decentralized applications (dApps)</strong>.</p>
<p>In the next lesson, we&rsquo;ll learn more about decentralized apps (dApps).</p>
