    <p>If you&rsquo;ve decided that it&rsquo;s worth buying or minting NFTs, then it&rsquo;s time to look for legit places where you can do so.</p>
    <p>Don&rsquo;t just go blindly buying some &ldquo;promising NFT with enormous profit potential&rdquo; from a &ldquo;fintech guy&rdquo; on a Discord group!</p>
    <p>There are two kinds of marketplaces for NFTs:</p>
    <ol>
    <li><strong>Centralized</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Decentralized</strong></li>
    </ol>
    <p>As the name suggests, centralized marketplaces have a central authority that typically takes care of the nitty-gritty.</p>
    <p>This covers things like copyright checks or owner authentication for the NFTs sold on its platform.</p>
    <p>In exchange, centralized marketplaces can impose certain restrictions or tack on extra fees for transactions.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, decentralized marketplaces have no central authority overseeing the activity. Anyone can pretty much list anything on the marketplace, even fake NFTs.</p>
    <p>Among the many in existence, there are a few NFT marketplaces that have earned a pretty solid reputation.</p>
    <h2>OpenSea</h2>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/11/04163845/opensea.png" /></p>
    <p>OpenSea is the first and largest marketplace where you can buy and sell NFTs.</p>
    <p>To date, there are roughly 35 million NFTs on the platform, covering a wide range of digital goods such as art pieces, game collectibles, virtual real estate, and domain names.</p>
    <p>OpenSea is also compatible with the Ethereum, Polygon, and Klaytn blockchains.</p>
    <p>Buyers can utilize over 150 payment tokens and buy either fixed-price NFTs or bid on items in auctions</p>
    <h2>SuperRare</h2>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/11/04163913/superrare.png" /></p>
    <p>SuperRare is another well-known peer-to-peer digital artwork marketplace.</p>
    <p>It is still in its early stages and only accepts payments in ETH, requiring users to have a MetaMask wallet as well.</p>
    <p>What makes SuperRare unique is that it screens artists&rsquo; profiles thoroughly and lists only those that meet its criteria.</p>
    <p>Also, it maintains exclusivity in hosting unique or single-edition art pieces.</p>
    <h2>Rarible</h2>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/11/04163935/rarible.png" /></p>
    <p>Rarible is also among the leading NFT marketplaces, particularly for tokenized digital collectibles.</p>
    <p>It allows users to mint, buy, and sell items from a variety of NFT categories like art, photography, music, animation, domains, metaverses, and games.</p>
    <p>Just as in OpenSea, some NFTs on Rarible are sold at a fixed price while some are auctioned.</p>
    <p>One advantage of using Rarible is you can earn royalties in NFTs you resell, which can create a stream of passive income.</p>
    <h2>Others</h2>
    <p>If you&rsquo;re looking to buy F-NFTs to take advantage of potential price upside without having to shell out big bucks for a whole NFT piece, marketplaces such as&nbsp;<strong>Fractional</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Niftex</strong>&nbsp;are worth checking out.</p>
    <p>Leading cryptocurrency exchanges such as Binance and Coinbase also launched their own NFT marketplaces to get a slice of the growing market.</p>
