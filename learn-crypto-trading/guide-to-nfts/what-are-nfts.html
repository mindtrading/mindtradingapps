    <p>In the dark old days before blockchain technology&nbsp;existed, it was hard for people to&nbsp;<strong>verify the authenticity</strong>&nbsp;of any unique asset they own without the help of an intermediary or trusted third party.</p>
    <p>Physical assets like ID cards and concert tickets could be forged, while goods like luxury bags and olive oil seem to be counterfeited on a regular basis.</p>
    <p>Digital assets have it worse as pictures can be copied and pasted, while songs and published materials can easily be downloaded without the owners getting a cent from the distribution.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/11/04111141/copy-paste-file.gif"  /></p>
    <p>Enter&nbsp;<strong>Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)</strong>, pronounced as &ldquo;en eff tees&rdquo;, which are digital assets that are stored on blockchains.</p>
    <p>WAIT. A NON-FUN WHAAA?!?!</p>
    <h2>What is an NFT?</h2>
    <p><strong>Non-fungible tokens are representations (tokens) of real-world information and physical or digital assets.</strong></p>
    <p>To put it another way, assets and/or information are &ldquo;tokenized&rdquo; using cryptography and are stored on a digital ledger&nbsp;with all the advantages of blockchain technology.</p>
    <p>Creating or &ldquo;<strong>minting</strong>&rdquo; NFTs on blockchains allows NFT owners to have a secure, decentralized, and immutable&nbsp;<strong>proof of ownership of a unique asset</strong>&nbsp;and all it represents.</p>
    <p>Many NFT creators take tokenization one step further by including metadata or attaching conditions around the digital asset&rsquo;s ownership and future distribution.</p>
    <h2>NFTs Are &ldquo;Non-Fungible&rdquo;</h2>
    <p>Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are called non-fungible because they&rsquo;re not&hellip;&nbsp;<strong>fungible</strong>.</p>
    <p>That is, each NFT is&nbsp;<strong>unique</strong>&nbsp;and cannot be substituted or interchanged with another.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;<strong>Non-fungible</strong>&rdquo; means that something is unique and can&rsquo;t be replaced with something else. Like your mother.</p>
    <p>A dollar bill, despite each having a unique serial number, is still fungible because any other one-dollar bill would still be worth one dollar and people won&rsquo;t think twice about exchanging one for another.</p>

    <p>Ditto for a cup of brown sugar in your pantry, which is indistinguishable and interchangeable from any cup of brown sugar in the grocery store.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/11/04110235/sugar-bag.png" /></p>
    <p>On the other hand,&nbsp;<strong>a child&rsquo;s drawing</strong>&nbsp;of her family on the fridge is non-fungible because&nbsp;<strong>there&rsquo;s nothing else like it</strong>, and is not interchangeable with another child&rsquo;s drawing of a butterfly.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/11/04110111/fridge-drawing-nft.png" /></p>
    <p>Or any drawing you&rsquo;ve ever seen, for that matter.</p>
    <p><strong>Your passport is also non-fungible</strong>&nbsp;because it contains unique information that makes it different from all other passports.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>An&nbsp;<strong>NFT</strong>&nbsp;is a unique digital identifier that is recorded in a blockchain and is used to certify authenticity and ownership.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h2>NFTs are NOT cryptocurrencies</h2>
    <p>Just because NFTs are cryptography-based assets and use blockchains doesn&rsquo;t mean that they are considered cryptocurrencies.</p>
    <p>For one thing,&nbsp;<strong>cryptocurrencies are fungible</strong>. One ETH is as good as any other ETH across crypto markets while an NFT is unique and can&rsquo;t be substituted by another.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/11/04112129/eth-is-not-nft.png" /></p>
    <p>NFTs are also created using&nbsp;<strong>a different token standard</strong>.</p>
    <p>Popular tokens like&nbsp;<strong>ETH</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>MATIC</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>SHIB</strong>&nbsp;use the ERC-20 standard on Ethereum&rsquo;s blockchain.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, most of today&rsquo;s NFTs typically follow the&nbsp;<strong>ERC-721</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>ERC-1155 token standards</strong>&nbsp;that have more specific rules around establishing ownership and transferring tokens.</p>
    <p>Lastly, NFTs can&rsquo;t be traded on your usual crypto exchanges. Instead, you&rsquo;ll have to browse through&nbsp;<strong>NFT marketplaces</strong>&nbsp;and establish an NFT-compatible wallet if you want to own one.</p>
