    <p>Now if NFTs are so cool, you&rsquo;ve probably thought of creating (or &ldquo;<em>minting</em>&ldquo;) one yourself.</p>
    <p>After all, you can technically put just about anything into an NFT if you wanted.</p>
    <p>All you have to do is store data on a digital ledger and the world is your oyster, right?</p>
    <p>What if you could pull off a Beeple and sell your NFT creation for millions of dollars?</p>
    <p>But just because you CAN create an NFT does not guarantee you will make a fortune. Heck, you might even lose money if you&rsquo;re not careful.</p>
    <p><img title="Create an NFT?" src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/11/04160758/create-nft-idea.png" /></p>
    <p>First off, you need a thorough&nbsp;<strong>understanding of NFT dApps and blockchains to be able to decide which one to use</strong>.</p>
    <p>Although the majority of NFTs are built on&nbsp;<strong>Ethereum</strong>, there are other blockchains such as&nbsp;<strong>Tezos</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Solana</strong>, or&nbsp;<strong>Flow</strong>&nbsp;that come with their respective pros and cons.</p>
    <p>Each of these blockchains has its own cryptocurrency, which means you have to read up on its market dynamics and corresponding transaction fees.</p>
    <p>Gotta make sure your potential revenues aren&rsquo;t eaten up by costs!</p>
    <p>Also, just because you&rsquo;ve come up with a unique and mind-blowing invention, like an alarm clock that cooks bacon at 6 am, does not mean the product will sell.</p>
    <p>It might not even make it through Shark Tank.</p>
    <p><strong>If your NFT creation does not provide any kind of value for potential buyers, then good luck selling it!</strong></p>
    <p>Yes, we know, avatars of uninterested primates or jpegs of rocks don&rsquo;t seem to be worth anything at all, but to the right audience, they are.</p>
    <p><img title="NFT Buyer" src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/11/04161428/NFT-buyer.png" /></p>
    <p>Of course, building that audience and getting your marketing plan done right is by no means an easy feat.</p>
    <p>Not everyone can get in touch with my buddies Snoop Dogg or Steve Aoki, then ask them to buy and promote an NFT.</p>
    <p>Just as in starting a business, you should ask yourself the following questions to determine if creating your NFT can be profitable:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>What</strong>&nbsp;are you offering to your potential customers?</li>
    <li>Which&nbsp;<strong>problems</strong>&nbsp;or market gaps are your NFTs addressing?</li>
    <li>Is there enough&nbsp;<strong>demand</strong>&nbsp;for your NFT and how do you gauge it?</li>
    <li>Are there similar NFTs in existence and how does yours&nbsp;<strong>differentiate</strong>&nbsp;from them?</li>
    <li>How do you plan to reach and build your&nbsp;<strong>target market</strong>?</li>
    </ul>
