    <p>Think you&rsquo;re ready to buy your first NFTs?</p>
    <p>Not if you&rsquo;ve skipped the basics of what non-fungible tokens are and the potential risks of buying and owning one!</p>
    <p>If you&rsquo;ve read up on your NFT 101 AND you&rsquo;re sure that you&rsquo;re not running on FOMO, then lemme give you the&nbsp;<strong>step-by-step process on how to buy your first NFT.&nbsp;</strong></p>
    <h2>1. Create an NFT-compatible wallet</h2>
    <p>As explained in my &ldquo;Beginner&rsquo;s Guide to Crypto Wallets&rdquo; course, while crypto wallets can show ownership and balances, they don&rsquo;t literally store your coins and tokens.</p>
    <p>Instead, crypto wallets store the keys that will grant you access to your digital assets.</p>
    <p>And what do we do with keys?</p>
    <p><strong>We don&rsquo;t lose them!</strong></p>
    <p>We also don&rsquo;t give keys to anyone unless we trust the person 110% not to rob us blind.</p>
    <p>This is why it&rsquo;s important to know your basic wallet options as well as the protection they provide.</p>
    <p>A&nbsp;<strong>hot wallet,</strong>&nbsp;for example, may provide easier access to your digital assets than a hardware-based&nbsp;<strong>cold wallet</strong>&nbsp;would but it&rsquo;s also more vulnerable to scams that may drain your balances.</p>
    <p>Of course, the wallets&rsquo; protection levels won&rsquo;t matter if you don&rsquo;t guard the&nbsp;<strong>private keys</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>seed phrase</strong>&nbsp;that serves as the &ldquo;password&rdquo; to your hot or cold wallets.</p>
    <p>Having trouble keeping up with NFT wallet lingo?</p>
    <p>Think of NFTs as your ticket to an exclusive concert. The ticket represents your ownership of a slot in the concert&rsquo;s audience so you really don&rsquo;t want to lose it.</p>
    <p>You can either take a picture of your ticket and store all the details on your phone (soft wallet) or keep the hard copy of the ticket (hard wallet) and place it in a safe place in your house.</p>
    <p>Either way, you shouldn&rsquo;t give your phone password or house keys (seed phrase or private key) to ANYBODY unless you want to risk somebody stealing your ticket and using your slot before you do.</p>
    <p>When buying blockchain-based NFTs, you should also aim for wallets that are compatible with:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>The&nbsp;<strong>blockchain</strong>&nbsp;where your NFTs are created and processed</li>
    <li>The crypto or fiat&nbsp;<strong>currency</strong>&nbsp;your NFT is priced in</li>
    <li>The&nbsp;<strong>platform</strong>&nbsp;that offers the NFT you&rsquo;re buying</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Not all wallets store NFTs</strong>&nbsp;and not all wallets are compatible with some blockchains, so you should double-check before you create one.</p>
    <p>Newbies can start by getting a&nbsp;<strong>Metamask</strong>&nbsp;wallet as it supports NFTs and some of the more commonly used blockchains and cryptocurrencies.</p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s easy to access on Google Chrome where you can add Metamask as an extension.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/11/05130539/metamask-browser-extension.png" /></p>
    <p>You&rsquo;re then asked to create a wallet that will yield the only SEED PHRASE &ndash; composed of about 12 to 24 words &ndash; that will unlock your wallet.</p>
    <p>Write your seed phrase on a piece of paper or store it somewhere where nobody can see it, not even apps that have access to your clipboards.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/11/05130636/metamask-secret-recovery-phrase.png" /></p>
    <p>Once you&rsquo;ve put in your&nbsp;<strong>seed phrase</strong>, you should have access to a wallet showing balances across different networks:</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/11/05130753/metamask-balance.png" /></p>
    <h2>2. Connect your wallet to an NFT marketplace</h2>
    <p>Is your wallet compatible with your preferred marketplace?</p>
    <p>Only one way to find out.</p>
    <p>Popular NFT marketplaces like OpenSea and Rarible list the compatible wallets almost as soon as you visit their sites.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/11/05130953/opensea-wallet-support.png" /></p>
    <p>Some mobile apps also use QR codes to connect wallets.</p>
    <p>While the NFT scene is pretty new, marketplaces will generally fall into three categories:</p>
    <p>An&nbsp;<strong>open</strong>&nbsp;marketplace allows anyone to buy, sell, or mint (create) NFTs.</p>
    <p>A&nbsp;<strong>closed</strong>&nbsp;marketplace is a bit more exclusive, only allowing select artists to sell and trade their goods.</p>
    <p>A&nbsp;<strong>proprietary</strong>&nbsp;marketplace sells NFTs that are either trademarked or copyrighted by the company operating it.</p>
    <p>Once you&rsquo;ve confirmed that your wallet can store NFTs from your preferred marketplace, you can start securing your funds.</p>
    <h2>3. Secure funds</h2>
    <p>Big NFT marketplaces usually allow the use of credit cards or even debit cards to purchase NFTs.</p>
    <p>For everything else, there&rsquo;s M̶a̶s̶t̶e̶r̶c̶a̶r̶d̶ ETH.</p>
    <p>Ethereum isn&rsquo;t the only blockchain on the NFT scene but it&rsquo;s the most widely used in NFT marketplaces.</p>
    <p>Ethereum&rsquo;s token ether (ETH) is also one of the most accessible cryptocurrencies found in centralized and decentralized exchanges.</p>
    <p>The easiest way to get your hands on some ETH is to buy it from a centralized exchange.</p>
    <p>Binance, Coinbase, and Gemini are some of the biggest centralized crypto exchanges.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/11/05131125/binance-cex.png" /></p>
    <p>Just keep in mind that coins and tokens stored in exchange wallets mean that the exchanges have your private keys.</p>
    <p>You can lose access to your balances if the exchange gets hacked or if the exchange locks your account for any reason.</p>
    <p>When it comes to exchanges, best think &ldquo;<strong>Not your keys, not your coins</strong>.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>This is why you should transfer your ETH balance to your non-exchange wallet as soon as you buy your ETH.</p>
    <p>To transfer your ETH from your exchange wallet to the wallet that&rsquo;s connected to the NFT marketplace, you should:</p>
    <h3>Withdraw ETH from your exchange wallet</h3>
    <p>Navigate to your crypto exchange&rsquo;s wallet and click the&nbsp;<em>Withdraw</em>&nbsp;button.</p>
    <p>Select ETH wallet in the &ldquo;Withdraw from&rdquo; field.</p>
    <h3>Send ETH to your non-exchange wallet&rsquo;s public address.</h3>
    <p>This is the 42-character hexadecimal address on your account.</p>
    <p>You can copy the address to the clipboard, scan the account&rsquo;s QR code, or manually input all 42 characters for extra security.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/11/05131335/copy-wallet-address.png" /></p>
    <h3>Wait a couple of minutes until the non-exchange wallet is reflecting the ETH transfer.</h3>
    <p>You can check Etherscan.io to get updates on your transaction.</p>
    <p>Don&rsquo;t forget that the withdrawal will incur&nbsp;<strong>gas</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>transaction fees</strong>!</p>
    <p>This means that the balance on your non-exchange wallet will be less than the amount you&rsquo;ve withdrawn from the exchange.</p>
    <p>Depending on the NFT listing and conditions, buying NFTs can also mean paying gas fees to the Ethereum network and maybe transaction fees to the marketplace.</p>
    <p>Make allowances if you want to send a whole or specific amount to your non-exchange wallet.</p>
    <p>Are you now seeing ETH reflected on the wallet you&rsquo;re using for the NFT marketplace?</p>
    <p>If yes, then CONGRATS! You just got your&nbsp;<strong>FUNDING SECURED</strong>!</p>
    <h2>4. Choose your NFT</h2>
    <p>Now that you&rsquo;ve connected your NFT wallet to the exchange and have the<strong>&nbsp;$$$</strong>, how do you know which NFTs you should buy?</p>
    <p>Should you buy the most bored-looking ape?</p>
    <p>How about the Reddit avatar that looks bougie af?</p>
    <p>A good place to start would be &ldquo;<strong>creators</strong>&rdquo; that you&rsquo;re already familiar with. Maybe your favorite pop stars and trading idols have their own recos.</p>
    <p>Browsing your&nbsp;<strong>social media</strong>&nbsp;*cough* Twitter *cough* feeds for trending hashtags or topics can also give hints on what&rsquo;s popular in the NFT world.</p>
    <p>Last but not least,&nbsp;<strong>marketplaces</strong>&nbsp;themselves provide trending works, artists, and collections that you can start with.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/11/05131619/opensea-marketplace.png" /></p>
    <p>Once you&rsquo;ve chosen your NFT, then you gotta pay attention to how you can buy it.</p>
    <p>Most NFT listings operate on a&nbsp;<strong>TIMED AUCTION</strong>&nbsp;that&rsquo;s not unlike eBay&rsquo;s items. The NFT will either go to the highest bidder, or the seller can choose to accept any offer during the auction.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/11/05131723/pudgy-penguin.png" /></p>
    <p>Other NFTs can simply be<strong>&nbsp;BOUGHT DIRECTLY</strong>&nbsp;for their listed price.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/11/05131814/buy-nft-directly.png" /></p>
    <p>Meanwhile, some marketplaces allow buyers to&nbsp;<strong>OFFER</strong>&nbsp;for listings that are currently not on sale, or offer prices that are marginally lower than the listed price.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/11/05131902/make-an-offer-for-nft.png" /></p>
    <p>Once you&rsquo;ve chosen an NFT, the marketplace will usually prompt you to double-check the purchase details.</p>
    <p>Transaction details can include:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>The&nbsp;<strong>public address o</strong>f the NFT payment recipient</li>
    <li>Total&nbsp;<strong>NFT price</strong></li>
    <li>Estimated&nbsp;<strong>gas fees</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Total purchase price</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/11/05132033/nft-transaction-example.png" /></p>
    <p>Take note that NFT prices and gas fees can change every few seconds. Make allowances for price AND gas fee fluctuations!</p>
    <p>Once you&rsquo;ve okayed the transaction, the NFT marketplace can take a few seconds to a few minutes to reflect your purchase.</p>
    <p>OpenSea, for example, shows your NFT purchases on your account profile.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/11/05132128/nft-purchase.png" /></p>
    <p>Wanna check your brand spankin&rsquo; new asset on your Metamask wallet?</p>
    <p>You can view your coin balances and assets (including NFTs) at https://portfolio.metamask.io/ or on your MetaMask mobile app.</p>
