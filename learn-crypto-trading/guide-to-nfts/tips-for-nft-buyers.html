    <p>Have you bought your first non-fungible token (NFT)?</p>
    <p>Or maybe you&rsquo;re still on the fence but are open to buying one or two (or four hundred) NFTs?</p>
    <p>Whether you&rsquo;re just planning to soothe a FOMO or you plan to make a career out of buying NFTs, here are 5 tips to help maximize your NFT investments:</p>
    <h2>1. Protect the bag</h2>
    <p>If you can&rsquo;t protect $30 worth of NFTs, how can you protect $300 or $3,000 worth of digital assets?</p>
    <p>Get to know the&nbsp;<strong>different crypto and NFT wallets</strong>&nbsp;on the market and pick one or two that will work for your needs. Invest in a cold wallet if you&rsquo;re planning on HODLing NFTs long-term.</p>
    <p>Use&nbsp;<strong>password managers</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>2FA</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>authenticator apps</strong>&nbsp;to make it really hard for scammers to steal your coins and NFTs.</p>

    <p>Read up on PHISHING SCAMS that aim to get your NFT account/wallet details by giving you fake forms via Twitter, Discord, or new project &ldquo;airdrops.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Likewise, watch out for CATFISHING SCAMS that imitate legitimate marketplaces, project websites, and influencer social media accounts to get you to share your wallet details.</p>
    <h2>2. Know the PRODUCT</h2>
    <p>Just like you wouldn&rsquo;t buy a stock or real estate until you&rsquo;ve done your research, you also shouldn&rsquo;t buy NFTs without knowing their value.</p>

    <p>Is the seller even selling original work? Or was the design pulled from an unsuspecting artist&rsquo;s catalog?</p>
    <p>Is the NFT committing&nbsp;<strong>copyright infringement</strong>?</p>
    <p>If so, then you probably shouldn&rsquo;t buy meme NFTs of your branded childhood faves.</p>
    <p>Will the NFT still have value even through a crypto winter?</p>
    <p>Remember that most NFTs are priced in cryptos. A crypto bear market can drag down your NFT&rsquo;s value, yo!</p>
    <h2>3. Know the SELLER</h2>
    <p>Even original artwork/tokens can lose value if their popularity is based on hype.</p>
    <p>Who&rsquo;s &ldquo;selling&rdquo; the NFT?</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/11/05134352/shady-nft-seller-360x360.png" /></p>
    <p>Are they celebrities and &ldquo;thought leaders&rdquo; who got paid to say &ldquo;Trust me bro. This collection will moon!&rdquo;?</p>
    <p>Or maybe you&rsquo;re getting FOMO from a dedicated group of &ldquo;early adopters&rdquo; who are preparing to dump after the pump.</p>
    <p>Look for strong, resilient communities who are truly excited about a project.</p>
    <p>If there&rsquo;s real-life demand, there&rsquo;s a better chance that your NFT will continue to gain in value.</p>
    <h2>4. Know the PLATFORM</h2>
    <p>If you REALLY want to maximize your NFT investments, you should also be aware of&nbsp;<strong>network or blockchain fees</strong>&nbsp;that may cut your profits.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, take note of&nbsp;<strong>marketplace restrictions</strong>&nbsp;that may limit how you buy/sell/trade your NFTs.</p>

    <h2>5. Get inspiration from the community</h2>
    <p>Planning to &ldquo;buy low, sell high&rdquo; your way to NFT investment success?</p>

    <p>You can follow popular NFT buyers or artists who can point you to future NFT trends.</p>
    <p>If you&rsquo;re lucky, you can even track their purchases on blockchains and snag similar works!</p>
    <p>Signing up on NFT groups and marketplaces can also work for you if you&rsquo;re into NFT drops.</p>
    <p>Planning on getting &ldquo;higher value&rdquo; NFTs? Try applying or signing up on curated platforms that invite more exclusive NFT artists.</p>
    <p>There you have it, folks!</p>
    <p>IRL traders have shed blood, sweat, and actual tears to share their lessons so make sure you don&rsquo;t waste it!</p>
