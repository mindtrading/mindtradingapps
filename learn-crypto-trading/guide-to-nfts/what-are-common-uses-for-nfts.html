    <p>A unique and programmable token that can irrefutably establish digital ownership?</p>
    <p>ERRBODY got time fo dat!</p>
    <p>NFTs&rsquo; popularity may have started with animal illustrations and pixelated avatars but users quickly found other popular use cases.</p>
    <h2>Art</h2>
    <p>By tokenizing an art product on a blockchain, artists can &ldquo;sign&rdquo; their work to prove that they own it.</p>
    <p>They can then cut middlemen and sell their work to a wider audience via global NFT exchanges.</p>
    <p>They can also establish transfer parameters through&nbsp;<strong>smart contracts</strong>&nbsp;so that they&rsquo;ll have more power over their product&rsquo;s margins and distribution.</p>
    <p>Artists can earn a small income each time their NFTs are exchanged instead of just earning from the initial sale.</p>
    <p>Similarly, big brands can tokenize their content for easier licensing activities, and major and minor celebrities can issue NFTs to sell exclusive merchandise to their followers.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, art collectors can enjoy proving ownership of rare physical or digital items without worrying that they&rsquo;re holding fakes.</p>
    <h2>Gaming</h2>
    <p>Why bother spending on your online game character&rsquo;s potions, skills, and fancy armor upgrades when you could permanently get locked out of your account at the drop of a hat?</p>
    <p>Thankfully, online games are warming up to blockchain technology, which allows players to&nbsp;<strong>earn/buy in-game assets that they directly own and can sell to other players</strong>.</p>
    <p>Some gaming NFTs may even be traded or ported to other games!</p>
    <h2>Fractional Ownership</h2>
    <p>NFTs by themselves cannot be split into parts as those parts will be fungible in nature.</p>
    <p>However, owners can lock NFTs into a smart contract that will yield a specific number of &ldquo;<strong>Fractionalized NFTs (F-NFTs)</strong>.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>These fractional shares are useful for people who want to &ldquo;own&rdquo; or sell an expensive, real-life product.</p>
    <p>A 14-bedroom mansion, for example, would sell quicker if multiple people agree to partially own it.</p>
    <p>F-NFT technology can likely facilitate that scenario and make future verification and sale much more efficient in the future than current processes.</p>
    <p>Small businesses could potentially get additional funding by offering some of their &ldquo;shards&rdquo; (partial ownership of the business through NFTs) to the public, similar to how corporations sell shares of the company in the public stock market to raise capital.</p>
    <h2>Identity Management</h2>
    <p>Proving ownership of a data point and storing it on a secure blockchain will come in handy for those who are looking to establish identity information.</p>
    <p>NFT technology can give people ready access to their birth certificates, passports, verified medical history, and education credentials.</p>
    <p>Not only that, but they&rsquo;ll be able to share only the relevant information with other parties as needed.</p>
    <p>Nobody can claim to have&nbsp;<em>your</em>&nbsp;birth certificate AND you won&rsquo;t have to fill out 37 forms every time you go to a different clinic or travel out of the country!</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, manufacturing businesses that use NFTs can confirm where their raw materials originated.</p>
    <p>They can then track their products&rsquo; progress through the supply chain and verify the authenticity of their products to their customers.</p>
    <p>Last but not least, NFTs can help sports and concert organizers prevent counterfeit ticket sales and help organizers control attendance at conventions.</p>
    <h2>Social Tokens</h2>
    <p>Social tokens are a broad category of NFTs issued by individuals and communities.</p>
    <p>Launching numbered batches of NFTs opens the door to membership &ldquo;clubs&rdquo; that offer an exclusive experience.</p>
    <p>For example, Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) offers members-only access to its art space called&nbsp;<em>Bathroom</em>.</p>
    <p>Other clubs can sell NFTs as membership tokens and offer other privileges. Artists can launch official fan clubs and lawyers and florists can sell tokens for their services.</p>
    <p>Token sellers can even track the NFT owners&rsquo; activities and offer rewards for engagement or loyalty!</p>
    <p>Imagine winning a five-minute chat with your K-pop idol as they have irrefutable proof through your membership that you&rsquo;ve watched their latest video 318 times in the last 24 hours&hellip;because who does that?</p>
    <h2>Collateral</h2>
    <p>NFTs may not function as cryptocurrencies but they&nbsp;<em>do</em>&nbsp;have value that can be leveraged to get cryptocurrency or fiat-denominated loans.</p>
    <p>Once the borrower and lender have agreed on the NFT&rsquo;s value and loan parameters, then using&nbsp;<strong>NFTs as collateral</strong>&nbsp;may not be too different from using art to get loans.</p>
    <p>Due to increasing demand, DeFi and CeFi applications are making progress in establishing NFT appraisal and collateral loan standards.</p>
