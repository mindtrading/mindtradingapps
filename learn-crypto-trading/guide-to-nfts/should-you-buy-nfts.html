    <p>In the previous lessons, you&rsquo;ve learned what an NFT is, a very brief history about them, and how they&rsquo;re used.</p>
    <p>This brings us to the million-dollar (or is it billion-dollar?) question:</p>
    <p><strong>Should you buy NFTs?</strong></p>
    <p>The short answer is: It depends on whether you see&nbsp;<strong>value</strong>&nbsp;in it or not.</p>
    <p>Now the concept of value, of course, is highly&nbsp;<strong>subjective</strong>.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/11/04154151/thinking-about-buying-nft.png" /></p>
    <p>As with buying original artwork by a world-famous artist, a pair of authentic Nike Air Mags, vintage sports memorabilia, or shares of a company, value is in the eye of the beholder.</p>
    <p>There are even websites, such as NFT Price Floor, that track the floor price, historical price chart, sales data and trade volume of the top NFT collections.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/11/02105726/nft-price-floor-780x482.png" /></p>
    <p>Some buy art for&nbsp;<strong>sentimental purposes</strong>&nbsp;or for<strong>&nbsp;social prestige</strong>.</p>
    <p>Some purchase rare sneakers to add to their&nbsp;<strong>collection</strong>.</p>
    <p>Some buy vintage goods at a bargain to&nbsp;<strong>flip them for a profit.</strong></p>
    <p>Some invest in startups because they see&nbsp;<strong>potential growth</strong>.</p>
    <p>If you plan on buying NFTs for similar reasons, then good for you!</p>
    <p>On the other hand, if you&rsquo;ll be shelling out thousands of dollars to buy an NFT out of sheer&nbsp;<strong>FOMO</strong>, then you might wanna back up a bit.</p>
    <p>In fact, back all the way up to the part where we talk about the risks involved in buying NFTs.</p>
    <p>Don&rsquo;t forget that art pieces or collectibles &ndash; be they physical or digital ones &ndash; can be challenging to authenticate and appraise.</p>
    <p><strong>Make sure you have a solid understanding of the NFT market and conduct your due diligence before forking over your money.</strong></p>
    <p>Just keep in mind that NFTs &ndash; heck, even blockchains &ndash; are still very relatively young technologies and industries.</p>
    <p>Think Leonardo DiCaprio&rsquo;s Titanic years before he gave us&nbsp;<em>Django Unchained</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>The Revenant</em>. It already looks legit, but its potential is unlimited.</p>
    <p>For now, we could use more<strong>&nbsp;unified protocols</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>interoperability</strong>&nbsp;to help decrease transaction costs and increase NFT adoption.</p>
    <p>Regulations would not only protect NFT owners from speculative price swings, but they would also encourage more people to tokenize their real-world assets on the blockchain.</p>
    <p>Developers can also increase&nbsp;<strong>security measures</strong>&nbsp;so that newbies and pros alike won&rsquo;t get scammed by fake browser extensions and counterfeit NFTs.</p>
    <p>Finally,&nbsp;<strong>appraisal standards</strong>&nbsp;would help participants price NFTs.</p>
    <p>Once the NFT ecosystem has made progress on these hurdles, then we could be looking at a world where<strong>&nbsp;almost all digital and (tokens of) physical assets are stored and traded on global blockchains.</strong></p>
