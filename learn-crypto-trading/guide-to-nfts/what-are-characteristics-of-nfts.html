    <p>In the previous lesson, you learned what an NFT is</p>
    <p>That NFTs, by definition, are NOT identical nor interchangeable with anything else.</p>
    <p>In other words, one of the defining characteristics of NFTs is that they are&nbsp;<strong>unique</strong>.</p>
    <p>What do I mean by unique?</p>
    <p>For example, there is only one&nbsp;<strong>Mona Lisa.&nbsp;</strong></p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/11/04120728/mona-lisa.png" /></p>
    <p>There may be several replicas and forgeries of the Mona Lisa, but&nbsp;<strong>only one was painted by Leonardo himself in the 1500s</strong>.</p>
    <p>And by Leonardo, I&rsquo;m talking about the Italian polymath, not the ninja turtle. ðŸ˜‚</p>
    <p>You can also take photos of the Mona Lisa or frame a high-res print to display in your living room, but that&rsquo;d be nowhere close to the monetary value given to the authentic original version.</p>
    <p>The real Mona Lisa is *probably* displayed in a huge gallery in the Louvre&hellip; or hermetically sealed in a secure underground vault. We may never know for sure.</p>
    <p><strong>Just like Mona Lisa is one of a kind, so is an NFT.&nbsp;</strong></p>
    <p>When it comes to famous art masterpieces, ownership and authenticity are verified through professional appraisers who issue certificates to guarantee that it is the one and only true original.</p>
    <p>With NFTs, keeping track of who owns what is made much more secure through the use of&nbsp;<strong>blockchain technology</strong>. Whoever holds the private keys to the address where an NFT is assigned on a blockchain has&nbsp;<strong>digital ownership</strong>&nbsp;and full control of the asset.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/11/04121336/nft-ownership-360x319.png" /></p>
    <p>This means that whoever owns the NFT solely has the ability to sell it or give it away. If you have an NFT that you&rsquo;ve decided to keep for yourself, you own it forever!</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Not familiar with&nbsp;<strong>private keys</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>addresses</strong>? Read our lesson on crypto wallets.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Even after you pass away, no one can just take the NFT for themselves like real-world assets, unless you&rsquo;ve given them some kind of access to your digital wallet.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>An NFT is a&nbsp;<em>package&nbsp;</em>that is made up of two key components: the&nbsp;<strong>token</strong>&nbsp;itself and the<strong>&nbsp;digital content</strong>. This digital content takes the form of a file, like a text file, image file, audio file, video file, etc. This file is known as the &ldquo;<strong>metadata</strong>&rdquo; While the token itself is stored &ldquo;<strong>on-chain</strong>&rdquo; or directly on a blockchain, the metadata is usually NOT stored on the blockchain, also known as being stored &ldquo;<strong>off-chain</strong>&ldquo;.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Because an NFT is technically a piece of code on a blockchain, it can be&nbsp;<strong>programmed</strong>&nbsp;to have various built-in features.</p>
    <p>One example is that&nbsp;<strong>royalties</strong>&nbsp;can be programmed on the tokens, which means that an artist can still monetize secondary sales of their work.</p>
    <p>And depending on the blockchain the NFT is built on, it is also&nbsp;<strong>permissionless</strong>. This means that third-party features can be built on the NFT, allowing it to be used in multiple ways, even more than what the original creators intended.</p>
