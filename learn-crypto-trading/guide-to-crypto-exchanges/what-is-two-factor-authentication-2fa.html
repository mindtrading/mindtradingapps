    <p>After signing up with a crypto exchange, you&rsquo;ll probably be required to configure security settings on your account and come across something called &ldquo;<strong>2FA</strong>&ldquo;.</p>
    <p>In this lesson, I&rsquo;m going to explain what 2FA is and why most crypto exchanges require it.</p>
    <p>In order to log in to any online account,&nbsp;<strong>authentication</strong>&nbsp;is required. Authentication is just a fancy word for &ldquo;proving the identity of a user&rdquo;.</p>
    <p><strong>2FA</strong>&nbsp;is a specific type of authentication process that requires two methods (also referred to as &ldquo;factors&rdquo;) to verify your identity.</p>
    <p>With so much personal information stored in our mobile devices and computers, it&rsquo;s no surprise that these are prime targets for hackers or malware resulting in data breaches</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>A&nbsp;<strong>data breach</strong>&nbsp;is an incident where information is stolen from a system without the knowledge or permission of the system&rsquo;s owner.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Because of that, most apps and websites have to beef up their security to protect their customers and their funds.</p>
    <p>One effective way that crypto exchanges used to verify that their users are really who they say they are is to require &ldquo;<strong>2FA</strong>.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>2FA provides an&nbsp;<strong>additional level of protection</strong>&nbsp;against unauthorized access to your crypto exchange account.</p>

    <h2>What is Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)?</h2>
    <p><strong>A password alone is NOT enough to keep your crypto exchange account secure</strong>.</p>
    <p>Two-factor authentication, or 2FA, is a method of improving the security of your crypto exchange&rsquo;s account by requiring an additional &ldquo;factor&rdquo; to prove the account holder&rsquo;s identity and be able to access their account.</p>
    <p>A &ldquo;factor&rdquo; is a distinct form of identification needed in order to access something.</p>
    <p>There are 3 main &ldquo;factors&rdquo;</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Something you KNOW&nbsp;</strong>(e.g. password, security question, PIN)</li>
    <li><strong>Something you HAVE&nbsp;</strong>(e.g. code provided by a device)</li>
    <li><strong>Something you ARE&nbsp;</strong>(e.g. fingerprint, iris scan, facial scan, voice scan)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In 2FA, you need to provide TWO factors to authenticate.</p>
    <p><strong>Security questions</strong>, such as &ldquo;What is your mother&rsquo;s maiden name?&rdquo; or &ldquo;What is the name of the street you grew up in?&rdquo; are NOT considered 2FA because they substitute for your password.</p>
    <p>Basically, the security question and your password are in the same category, which makes it NOT a two-factor.</p>
    <h2>How does 2FA work?</h2>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/05/19140356/2fa-process-780x276.png" /></p>
    <p>There are two popular 2FA options:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>SMS</li>
    <li>Authenticator app</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>SMS</h3>
    <p>Originally, entering a code sent to your phone via a text message was the primary option for the second &ldquo;factor&rdquo; of 2FA authentication.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/05/19125142/2fa-sms-code.png" /></p>
    <p>Since most people own a smartphone, it was easy for them to just provide their mobile number and receive a text message that contained a code to enter after entering their username and password.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, hackers have devised multiple methods to&nbsp;<em>reroute</em>&nbsp;your phone number and intercept these text messages (like SIM swapping).</p>
    <p><strong>Authenticator apps have proven to be more secure and reliable than SMS.&nbsp;</strong></p>
    <h3>Authenticator app</h3>
    <p>Authenticator apps work in a similar fashion to SMS text.</p>
    <p>You get a code on an app on your smartphone and use it in combination with your username and password to log into your accounts.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/05/19121417/2fa-code-360x315.png" /></p>
    <p>The critical difference is that&nbsp;<strong>the code is NOT delivered over the mobile network&nbsp;</strong>and c<strong>an work offline</strong>.</p>
    <p>This makes it much more difficult for hackers to intercept the code.</p>
    <p>In order for the Authenticap app to work with the account you are trying to access, you first need to &ldquo;pair&rdquo; the app on your smartphone with the account.</p>
    <p>If you change phones, you have to go through the process&nbsp;<em>again</em>.</p>
    <p>After logging into your crypto exchange&rsquo;s account with your username and password, 2FA requires that you enter a<strong>&nbsp;One-Time Password (OTP)</strong>&nbsp;that is sent to your smartphone to complete your login process.</p>
    <p><strong>OTP</strong>&nbsp;is a 6-digit code generated by smartphone apps such as Authy, Google Authenticator, or Microsoft Authenticator</p>
    <p>One-time passwords are a common possession or &ldquo;<strong>something you have</strong>&ldquo;.&nbsp;As its name suggests, the OTP only works once.</p>
    <p>This enhances your security as it requires an additional layer of authentication from your smartphone before your login is verified. The overall strength of the authentication is the&nbsp;<strong>combination</strong>&nbsp;of the two factors.</p>
    <p>In the scary scenario where your password has been compromised, a hacker would still need the OTP. As long as your phone is still in your possession, only you would be able to provide the OTP.</p>
    <p>Without your physical device, the remote hacker can&rsquo;t pretend to be you in order to gain unauthorized access to your account.</p>
    <h2>HOTP vs TOTP</h2>
    <p>Authenticator apps create one-time passwords (OTPs). OTPs are&nbsp;<strong>unique numeric passwords</strong>&nbsp;generated with a standardized algorithm. And are available offline.</p>
    <p>Some exchanges require you to choose the type of OTP standard for your 2FA setup.</p>
    <p>There are 2 types of OTP standards:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>HOTP</strong>&nbsp;(HMAC-based One Time Password)</li>
    <li><strong>TOTP</strong>&nbsp;(Time-based One Time Password)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The HOTP password can be valid for an unknown period of time. In contrast, the TOTP password changes&nbsp;<strong>every 30 seconds</strong>.</p>
    <p><strong>TOTP is more secure</strong>&nbsp;since the code is generated by your Authenticator app every 30 seconds and requires synchronization between the app on your device and the app&rsquo;s server.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Make sure to use 2FA&nbsp;<strong>everywhere!&nbsp;</strong>Not just for your crypto exchange account, but for your online bank accounts, email accounts, your password manager, and any other online service that requires a login.</p>
