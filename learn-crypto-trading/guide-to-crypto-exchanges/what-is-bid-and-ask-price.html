    <p>On your crypto exchange&rsquo;s trading platform, when looking to trade a specific cryptocurrency like bitcoin (BTC), you will see a bunch of numbers known as the &ldquo;<strong>bid</strong>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<strong>ask</strong>&rdquo; prices.</p>
    <p>But what are these prices? And what do they mean?</p>
    <p>Understanding the&nbsp;<strong>mechanics of pricing</strong>&nbsp;is crucial to understanding how crypto exchanges work.<img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/06/23130315/bid-and-ask-prices-347x360.png" /></p>
    <p>In order to have any kind of market,&nbsp;<strong>transactions</strong>&nbsp;need to occur.</p>
    <p>And in order for transactions to occur, you need to have both&nbsp;<strong>buyers</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>sellers</strong>.</p>
    <p>On a spot crypto exchange, a buyer is a person who wants to buy a cryptocurrency. And the seller is a person who owns a cryptocurrency and wants to&nbsp;<em>exchange</em>&nbsp;it either for fiat currency like U.S. dollars (USD ) or for another cryptocurrency like ether (ETH).</p>
    <p>The bid and ask prices are the prices at which other buyers are willing to buy and sellers are willing to sell.</p>
    <p><strong>Buyers bid</strong>&nbsp;and<strong>&nbsp;sellers ask</strong>&nbsp;(or&nbsp;<strong>offer</strong>).</p>
    <p>When entering a buy order, your order needs to match with a seller. And when entering a sell order, your order needs to match with a buyer.</p>
    <p>So when you see a price quote:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>The&nbsp;<em>bid</em>&nbsp;is the price at which you can&nbsp;<strong>sell</strong></li>
    <li>The&nbsp;<em>offer</em>&nbsp;is the price at which you can&nbsp;<strong>buy</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How Bid and Ask Prices Work</h2>
    <p>A buyer wants to buy at the lowest possible price, while a seller wants to sell at the highest possible price.</p>
    <p>So for a trade to happen, the person looking to buy and the person looking to sell have to&nbsp;<strong>agree on a specific price</strong>.</p>
    <p>A crypto exchange is structured to constantly find a price that both the buyer and seller will agree on.</p>
    <p>To come up with a price, a crypto exchange provides a trading platform where crypto traders can submit orders stating at what price and how many units they are willing to buy (AND sell) a specific cryptocurrency.</p>
    <p>Said differently, a crypto trader looking to buy or sell a specific TRADING PAIR will state a specific PRICE and specific QUANTITY.</p>
    <p>These orders are then displayed and can be seen by&nbsp;<em>everyone</em>&nbsp;trading on the exchange.</p>
    <p>In the trading world:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>The word &ldquo;bid&rdquo; is the price someone is willing to buy,</li>
    <li>The word &ldquo;ask&rdquo; is the price someone is willing to sell ((also sometimes referred to as an &ldquo;offer&rdquo;).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In normal circumstances,&nbsp;<strong>the bid price is lower than the ask price</strong>.</p>
    <p>The slight price difference between these two prices is known as the &ldquo;<strong>bid-ask spread</strong>&rdquo; or usually just the &ldquo;<strong>spread</strong>&ldquo;.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>The highest price that someone is willing to buy a crypto at is known as the &ldquo;<strong>best bid</strong>&ldquo;.</li>
    <li>This best bid price guarantees the highest possible price for any seller at that particular time.</li>
    <li>The lowest possible price that someone is willing to sell at is called the &ldquo;<strong>best ask</strong>&rdquo; or &ldquo;<strong>best offer&rdquo;.</strong></li>
    <li>This best ask price guarantees the lowest possible price for any buyer at that particular time.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This mechanism of &rdquo; best bid&rdquo; and &ldquo;best ask&rdquo; is an effective way to keep the market&nbsp;<strong>fair</strong>. It&rsquo;s designed to give traders the&nbsp;<strong>best possible price available at that moment in time</strong>.</p>
    <h2>How do Crypto Exchanges Use Bid and Ask Prices?</h2>
    <p>Crypto exchanges match buyers and sellers together and automate the entire process.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/05/26190907/crypto-order-types.png" /></p>
    <p>On their trading platform, after you&rsquo;ve selected a trading pair (a crypto/fiat or crypto/crypto pair), when you want to buy or sell, you&rsquo;ll be provided an order form where you can place the following&nbsp;<strong>order types</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Market</strong>&nbsp;order</li>
    <li><strong>Limit</strong>&nbsp;order</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A&nbsp;<strong>market order</strong>&nbsp;will execute immediately at the current best available price</p>
    <ul>
    <li>If you&rsquo;re buying, your trade will execute at the &ldquo;best bid&rdquo; price.</li>
    <li>If you&rsquo;re selling, your trade will execute at the &ldquo;best ask&rdquo; price.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A l<strong>imit order</strong>&nbsp;lets you set a specific price for the order to execute.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>If you&rsquo;re buying, you can place a<strong>&nbsp;buy limit order</strong>&nbsp;and specify a &ldquo;limit price&rdquo;, which is the maximum price you&rsquo;re willing to pay.</li>
    <li>If you&rsquo;re selling, you can place a<strong>&nbsp;sell limit order</strong>&nbsp;and specify a &ldquo;limit price&rdquo;, which is the minimum price you&rsquo;re willing to accept.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Traders often use limit orders to have&nbsp;<strong>more control over execution prices</strong>.</p>
    <p>And it is the buy limit and sell limit orders that provide liquidity on a crypto exchange.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>The buy limit orders are the BIDS.</li>
    <li>The sell limit orders are the ASKS.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The crypto exchange aggregates these bids and asks and with this data, sets the current best available price(&ldquo;market price&rdquo;) in real-time.</p>
    <p>Below is a simplified account of how this works on most crypto exchanges.</p>
    <p>The&nbsp;<strong>green</strong>&nbsp;bars show the volume of bids (buy orders) and the&nbsp;<strong>red</strong>&nbsp;show the volume of asks (sell orders).</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/05/22115820/bid-and-ask-prices-crypto-exchange.png" /></p>
    <p>Whenever a bid and ask price &ldquo;<strong>cross</strong>&rdquo;, this means that&nbsp;<strong>a seller will sell at a price that a buyer is willing to pay&nbsp;</strong>OR&nbsp;<strong>a buyer will buy at a price that a seller is willing to accept.</strong></p>
    <p>When this happens, the crypto exchange immediately matches and fills as much volume as it can for those orders.</p>
    <p>This ensures the&nbsp;<strong>buyers always buy at the lowest ask price</strong>, and the&nbsp;<strong>sellers sell at the highest bid price</strong>.</p>
