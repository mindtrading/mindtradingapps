    <p>Trading cryptocurrencies is not free.ðŸ˜²</p>
    <p>When buying and selling cryptocurrencies on a trading platform provided by a&nbsp;<strong>centralized crypto exchange (CEX)</strong>, you have to pay&nbsp;<strong>trading fees</strong>.</p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s important to be aware of the types of trading fees that crypto exchanges charge and understand how they work.</p>
    <p>In general, when calculating fees on a crypto exchange, the fees are based on the&nbsp;<strong>type of order</strong>&nbsp;that you place and are charged when the order is&nbsp;<strong>executed and matched</strong>.</p>
    <p>Orders are usually classified into two categories:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Orders charged with &ldquo;<strong>maker fees</strong>&ldquo;</li>
    <li>Orders charged with &ldquo;<strong>taker fees</strong>&ldquo;</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Maker fees are lower than maker fees. And both fees vary depending on your&nbsp;<strong>average trading volume</strong>&nbsp;over a given time period (usually the past 30 days).</p>
    <p>As your trading volume&nbsp;<em>increases</em>, the&nbsp;<em>lower</em>&nbsp;your fees as a percentage of your trade size.</p>
    <p>In this lesson, you are going to learn about:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>The fee structure that crypto exchanges use that&rsquo;s commonly known as the&nbsp;<strong>&ldquo;maker-taker&rdquo; fee</strong>&nbsp;model.</li>
    <li>The concepts of &ldquo;<strong>maker</strong>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<strong>taker</strong>&ldquo;.</li>
    <li>What &ldquo;<strong>maker fees</strong>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<strong>taker fees&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;are and the differences between them.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>What is a maker and taker?</h2>
    <p>The purpose of a crypto exchange is to&nbsp;<strong>match orders</strong>&nbsp;from customers who want to BUY cryptocurrencies with orders from customers who want to SELL cryptocurrencies.</p>
    <p>For providing this &ldquo;matching&rdquo; service, a crypto exchange will charge you a fee when your order is&nbsp;<strong>executed</strong>&nbsp;(&ldquo;matched&rdquo; with another customer&rsquo;s order).</p>
    <p>The fee depends on the following:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>The trading pair</li>
    <li>Your trading volume within a specific time period</li>
    <li>Whether your order is&nbsp;<strong>maker</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>taker</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Most crypto exchanges utilize a&nbsp;<strong>&ldquo;maker-taker&rdquo; fee model</strong>&nbsp;for determining trading fees for all orders.</p>
    <p>The maker-taker model is a way to differentiate fees between orders that add liquidity (&ldquo;maker&rdquo; orders) and take away liquidity (&ldquo;taker&rdquo; orders).</p>
    <p>If you place an order that is executed immediately, you are considered a &ldquo;<strong>taker</strong>&rdquo; because this order&nbsp;<strong>takes liquidity</strong>&nbsp;and will be charged a &ldquo;<strong>taker fee</strong>&ldquo;.</p>
    <p>If you place an order that is NOT executed immediately, but instead &ldquo;rests&rdquo; or &ldquo;sits&rdquo; on the order book, you are considered a &ldquo;maker&rdquo; because this order<strong>&nbsp;adds liquidity</strong>&nbsp;and will be charged a&rdquo;&nbsp;<strong>maker fee</strong>&ldquo;.</p>
    <p>Maker and taker orders are charged different fees.</p>
    <h2>What is a maker fee?</h2>
    <p>A &ldquo;maker fee&rdquo; is charged for &ldquo;maker&rdquo; orders.</p>
    <p>A&nbsp;<strong>maker order</strong>&nbsp;is an order you place that is NOT executed or matched immediately with a buyer&rsquo;s (or seller&rsquo;s) order on the order book.</p>
    <p>More specifically, in order to be considered a maker order:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>A buy order has to be placed at a<strong>&nbsp;lower price than the lowest sell order</strong>&nbsp;(or &ldquo;ask&rdquo;) on the order book.</li>
    <li>A sell order has to be placed at a&nbsp;<strong>higher price than the highest buy order</strong>&nbsp;(or &ldquo;bid&rdquo;) on the order book.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Your order is ADDED to the order book. And when this happens, you become a &ldquo;maker&rdquo;.</p>
    <h3>A limit order is a maker order.</h3>
    <p>A&nbsp;<strong>limit order</strong>&nbsp;that is NOT executed immediately is considered a maker order.</p>
    <p>For example, if BTC/USD is currently trading at&nbsp;<strong>$31,000</strong>&nbsp;and you submit a buy limit order for 1 BTC at a limit price of&nbsp;<strong>$30,000</strong>, this order will not be immediately executed.</p>
    <p>Instead, it will be added to the order book. The order will &ldquo;<strong>rest</strong>&rdquo; on the order book and will not be executed unless the price falls to $30,000.</p>
    <p>By placing this order, you&rsquo;re referred to as a &ldquo;<strong>maker</strong>&rdquo; because you added liquidity or &ldquo;<strong>made</strong>&rdquo; a market.</p>
    <p>If you hadn&rsquo;t placed that order, there may not be any other traders willing to buy 1 BTC for $30,000.</p>
    <p>So if a seller appeared who was willing to sell 1 BTC for $30,000, there would literally be &ldquo;<strong>no market</strong>&rdquo; because there are no buyers willing to buy at the seller&rsquo;s price.</p>
    <p>(This would be similar to you going on eBay, listing your Rolex watch or Herm&egrave;s bag for sale, and not a single buyer showing up. There is no market for your item.)</p>
    <p>But with your order, you&rsquo;re able to &ldquo;<strong>make a market</strong>&rdquo; because now there&rsquo;s a buyer (you) who will buy from the seller.</p>
    <p>This is why you&rsquo;re called a &ldquo;maker&rdquo;.</p>
    <h2>What is a taker fee?</h2>
    <p>A &ldquo;taker fee&rdquo; is charged for &ldquo;taker&rdquo; orders.</p>
    <p>What is a&nbsp;<strong>taker order</strong>?</p>
    <p>A taker order is an order that is matched immediately against a&nbsp;buyer&rsquo;s (or seller&rsquo;s) order already on the order book.</p>
    <p>More specifically, in order to be considered a taker order:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>A buy order has to be placed at the&nbsp;<strong>lowest sell order</strong>&nbsp;(or &ldquo;best ask&rdquo;) on the order book.</li>
    <li>A sell order has to be placed at the&nbsp;<strong>highest buy order</strong>&nbsp;(or &ldquo;best bid&rdquo;) on the order book.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Your order removes or TAKES existing orders on the order book. And when this happens, you become a &ldquo;taker&rdquo;.</p>
    <h3>A market order is a taker order.</h3>
    <p>A&nbsp;<strong>market order</strong>&nbsp;is considered a taker order since it executes immediately.</p>
    <p>For example, if BTC/USD is currently trading at&nbsp;<strong>$31,000</strong>&nbsp;and you submit a market order for 1 BTC, this order will be immediately executed.</p>
    <p>By placing this order, you&rsquo;re referred to as a &ldquo;<strong>taker&nbsp;</strong>&rdquo; because you &ldquo;<strong>took liquidit</strong>y&rdquo; from&nbsp;the market.</p>
    <p>If you hadn&rsquo;t placed that order, there would still be a sell order pending on the order book willing to sell 1 BTC for $31,000.</p>
    <p>But since you &ldquo;took&rdquo; that order (your market buy order was immediately matched with the seller&rsquo;s limit order), if&nbsp;<em>another</em>&nbsp;buyer appeared willing to buy 1 BTC for $31,000, there may not be another seller willing to accept that same price.</p>
    <h2>Examples of Maker and Taker Fees</h2>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s look at an example of how a crypto exchange would charge you if you were a &ldquo;maker&rdquo; versus a &ldquo;taker&rdquo;.</p>
    <h3>Taker Fee Example</h3>
    <p>We&rsquo;ll assume the following:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>You want to purchase 3 bitcoin (BTC) at a price of $30,000</li>
    <li>Your 30-day trading volume is currently at&nbsp;<strong>$100,000</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>According to the crypto exchange&rsquo;s fee schedule, you will either be charged one of the following:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>The maker fee of&nbsp;<strong>0.15%</strong></li>
    <li>The taker fee of&nbsp;<strong>0.25%.</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Your order is executed with taker fees</p>
    <p>In this example, the total costs of your order equals 3 * $30,000 =&nbsp;<strong>$90,000</strong>.</p>
    <p>You place your order as a market order and it is immediately filled.</p>
    <p>Because your order was executed as a &ldquo;taker&rdquo;, the total &ldquo;taker fee&rdquo; can be calculated:</p>
    <pre>$90,000 * (0.25 / 100) = <strong>$225</strong></pre>
    <h3>Maker Fee Example</h3>
    <p>In this example, you&rsquo;re a big baller shot caller, known in the crypto world as a &ldquo;<strong>whale</strong>&rdquo; and assume the following:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>You want to purchase 100 bitcoin (BTC) at a price of $20,000</li>
    <li>&nbsp;Your 30-day trading volume is currently at&nbsp;<strong>$10,000,000.</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>According to the crypto exchange&rsquo;s fee schedule, you will either be charged one of the following:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>The maker fee of&nbsp;<strong>0.02%</strong></li>
    <li>The taker fee of<strong>&nbsp;0.10%.</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>In this example, the total costs of your order equals 10 * $20,000 = $2,000,000. Which is your toilet paper budget for one of your eight mansions.</p>
    <p>Currently, BTC/USD is trading at $30,000 so you place a buy limit order at&nbsp;<strong>$20,000</strong>.</p>
    <p>Your order is now &ldquo;resting&rdquo; on the order book.</p>
    <p>The next morning, the crypto market tanks and bitcoin falls and your order gets filled.</p>
    <p>Because your order was executed as a &ldquo;maker&rdquo;, the total &ldquo;maker fee&rdquo; can now be calculated:</p>
    <pre>$2,000,000 * (0.02 / 100) = <strong>$400</strong></pre>
    <p>If you noticed, the maker fee is lower than the taker fee. This encourages traders to add liquidity.</p>
    <p>The downside with&nbsp;<strong>maker orders is it can some take time for your order to be filled</strong>. It&rsquo;s possible that your order will &ldquo;rest&rdquo; on the order book and&nbsp;<em>never</em>&nbsp;be filled if there aren&rsquo;t a lot of market participants (known as a &ldquo;thin market&rdquo;).</p>
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>A market for a given trading pair is made up of&nbsp;<strong>makers</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>takers</strong>.</p>
    <p>There is&nbsp;<em>always</em>&nbsp;a maker and a taker for every executed order.</p>
    <p><strong>Makers</strong>&nbsp;create buy or sell orders that aren&rsquo;t executed immediately. This creates&nbsp;<strong>liquidity</strong>, meaning it&rsquo;s easier for&nbsp;<em>other</em>&nbsp;people to immediately buy or sell if they agree to the price specified by the makers&rsquo; orders.</p>
    <p>The people who wish to buy or sell immediately are called &ldquo;takers&rdquo;. They &ldquo;take&rdquo; the orders created by the &ldquo;makers&rdquo;.</p>
    <p>Makers are charged a &ldquo;maker fee&rdquo; when their order is executed, while takers are charged a &ldquo;taker fee&rdquo;.</p>
    <p>Your order could be charged BOTH maker and taker fees.</p>
    <p>For example, if you place an order that is&nbsp;<em>partially</em>&nbsp;executed immediately, you will be charged a<strong>&nbsp;taker fee</strong>&nbsp;on the portion.</p>
    <p>The&nbsp;<em>remaining</em>&nbsp;portion of your order will be added to the order book and will be charged a&nbsp;<strong>maker fee</strong>&nbsp;if/when it is executed.</p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s say that you wanted to buy 2 BTC. One BTC could be executed immediately (and you&rsquo;d pay a taker fee), and if there are no more sellers at your price, you&rsquo;d have to wait until one appears. And when a seller does finally appear and the last half of your order executes, you&rsquo;d pay a maker fee.</p>
    <p>In my opinion,&nbsp;<strong>you should try to use a limit order</strong>&nbsp;when making trades to benefit from a lower maker fee.</p>
    <p>Generally, crypto exchanges reward makers with lower fees since they add liquidity. Since takers are provided the &ldquo;immediacy&rdquo; of being to buy or sell, they pay a higher fee for this benefit.</p>
    <p>In summary:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Makers</strong>&nbsp;&ldquo;create or make a market&rdquo; by adding orders for other traders to take.</li>
    <li>An order is charged the<strong>&nbsp;maker fee</strong>&nbsp;if the order is not matched immediately against an order already on the order book.</li>
    <li><strong>Takers</strong>&nbsp;remove liquidity by &ldquo;taking&rdquo; available orders that are filled immediately (and are charged a<strong>&nbsp;taker fee</strong>).</li>
    <li>An order is charged the&nbsp;<strong>taker fee</strong>&nbsp;if the order is matched immediately against an order already on the order book.</li>
