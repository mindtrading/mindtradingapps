    <p>In the crypto market, most crypto traders and investors buy and sell cryptocurrencies on a centralized exchange&nbsp;(CEX).</p>
    <p>A key concept that you should understand before placing your first crypto trade on an exchange is the &ldquo;<strong>order book&rdquo;</strong>.</p>
    <p>An order book offers a real-time &ldquo;behind the scenes&rdquo; view into the&nbsp;<strong>supply and demand</strong>&nbsp;of a particular cryptocurrency.</p>
    <p>In this lesson, I will discuss the purpose of a crypto exchange&rsquo;s order book and how it is used to execute trades.</p>
    <h2>What is an order book?</h2>
    <p>An order book is a&nbsp;<strong>list</strong>&nbsp;of all the pending (or &ldquo;open&rdquo;) buy and sell orders that are currently available for a specific trading pair.</p>
    <p>The order book is&nbsp;<strong>public</strong>, allowing all users on an exchange to see the orders in the market.</p>
    <p>As traders add, remove, change, and execute orders,&nbsp;<strong>the order book will change</strong>.</p>
    <p>For example, a crypto exchange could have an order book for the BTC/USD trading pair.</p>
    <p>The order book will have all the buy and sell limit orders that customers have placed on the exchange to either buy or sell bitcoin (BTC) for U.S. dollars (USD).</p>
    <p>Since the price of bitcoin (BTC) is using USD as the quote currency, this means that BTC is priced in USD on the order book.</p>
    <p>Crypto exchanges all you to trade multiple trading pairs. For example, aside from being to trade&nbsp;<strong>BTC/USD</strong>, you can also trade other cryptos/fiat pairs like ETH/USD, BNB/USD, ADA/USD, or even crypto/crypto pairs like ETH/BTC or ADA/ETH.</p>
    <p>Each trading pair has its own order book. So on a crypto exchange,&nbsp;<strong>there is not just one order book, but many</strong>!</p>
    <p>Anybody can place a pending order, also known as a &ldquo;<strong>limit order</strong>&rdquo; on an order book.</p>
    <p>That order will remain on the order book until the person that placed the order either:</p>
    <ol>
    <li><strong>Cancels</strong>&nbsp;the order or&hellip;</li>
    <li>Another person agrees to&nbsp;<strong>take</strong>&nbsp;the order.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>For example, if you place a limit order to buy bitcoin (BTC) for&nbsp;<strong>30,000</strong>&nbsp;USD, someone else on the exchange will need to agree to sell bitcoin BTC) at the same price of 30,000 USD.</p>
    <p>Placing an order does not necessarily mean that another person will agree to take your order. If someone else on the exchange places a better order than the one you placed, then that order will be taken first.</p>
    <p>Returning to the previous example, if someone else places a limit order to buy bitcoin (BTC) for&nbsp;<strong>30,001</strong>&nbsp;USD, which is higher than your order price of&nbsp;<strong>30,000</strong>&nbsp;USD, then that order will be taken first. Why would a seller accept your price when it can get a slightly higher price instead?</p>
    <p>The requirement to take the best available bid or ask price is enforced by a crypto exchange so its customers don&rsquo;t accidentally take a worse price than the best one available.</p>
    <h2>How do I use an order book?</h2>
    <p>When you place an order on the exchange, you have two options.</p>
    <ol>
    <li>You can place a limit order that will &ldquo;sit&rdquo; in the order book and&nbsp;<strong>wait for someone else to take</strong>&nbsp;it.</li>
    <li><strong>You can immediately take</strong>&nbsp;someone else&rsquo;s limit order that&rsquo;s already &ldquo;sitting&rdquo; on the order book.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Here&rsquo;s an example of what an order book looks like:</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/05/22150933/crypto-exchange-order-book.png" /></p>
    <p>The asks are shown in&nbsp;<strong>red</strong>&nbsp;and the bids are shown in&nbsp;<strong>green</strong>.</p>
    <p>For each price level, you will see a &ldquo;Market Size&rdquo; or &ldquo;Cumulative Quantity&rdquo;. This is the quantity of the cryptocurrency that are willing to be bought or sold at that specific price.</p>
    <p>You can think of the order book as representing&nbsp;<strong>supply and demand</strong>.</p>
    <p>The asks are people offering their bitcoins (BTC) for sale on the exchange and providing&nbsp;<strong>supply</strong>&nbsp;to fulfill the&nbsp;<strong>demand</strong>&nbsp;from buyers.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/05/22171407/crypto-order-book-example.png" /></p>
    <p>This order book shows the available buy and sell orders for the BTC/USD trading pair.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>The&nbsp;<strong>buy side</strong>&nbsp;(in&nbsp;<strong>green</strong>) represents all open buy orders (&ldquo;bids&rdquo;) below the last traded price.</li>
    <li>The&nbsp;<strong>sell side&nbsp;</strong>(in&nbsp;<strong>red</strong>&nbsp;) represents all open sell orders (&ldquo;asks&rdquo;) above the last traded price.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you look closely, near the middle, you can see the &ldquo;best bid&rdquo; and the &ldquo;best ask&rdquo;.</p>
    <p>The &ldquo;best bid&rdquo; price, which is the highest price someone is willing to buy some bitcoin, is&nbsp;<strong>29968.79</strong></p>
    <p>The buyer(s) who entered this order is basically saying, &ldquo;Yo, I am&nbsp;<em><strong>bidding</strong>&nbsp;</em>on 0.0474 units of BTC in exchange for&nbsp;<strong>29968.79&nbsp;</strong>USD.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>The &ldquo;best ask&rdquo; price, which is the lowest price someone is willing to sell their bitcoin, is&nbsp;<strong>29969.62</strong></p>
    <p>The seller(s) who entered this order is basically saying, &ldquo;Yo, I am&nbsp;<em><strong>asking</strong>&nbsp;</em>someone to buy 0.0276 units of BTC that I own for&nbsp;<strong>29.969.62&nbsp;</strong>USD.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>The&nbsp;<em>gap</em>&nbsp;between the highest buying price (&ldquo;best bid&rdquo;) and the lowest selling price (&ldquo;best ask&rdquo;) is called the &ldquo;<strong>spread</strong>&ldquo;.</p>
    <p>The spread measures the difference between the highest buy order and the lowest sell order.</p>
    <p>In this case, the spread is&nbsp;<strong>0.81</strong>&nbsp;USD.</p>
    <h2>What if I want to buy?</h2>
    <p>If you want to&nbsp;<strong>buy</strong>&nbsp;BTC/USD, you can either:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Place a buy limit order on the buy side (green text)</li>
    <li>Take the best ask on the sell side (red text)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Since the best ask price on the sell side is&nbsp;<strong>29.969.62&nbsp;</strong>USD, you can instantly &ldquo;take&rdquo; that price by placing a &ldquo;<strong>market order</strong>&ldquo;.And you become the proud new owner of 0.0276 bitcoin. üòÅ</p>
    <p>Otherwise, you would need to place (or &ldquo; make&rdquo;) a buy &ldquo;<strong>limit order</strong>&rdquo; specifying a &ldquo;<strong>limit price</strong>&rdquo; that is less than or equal to&nbsp;<strong>29968.79&nbsp;</strong>USD on the buy side.</p>
    <p>All these buy limit orders remain &ldquo;open&rdquo; and will just &ldquo;sit&rdquo; in the order book until someone agrees to sell or &ldquo;take&rdquo; at the limit price.</p>
    <p>There is no guarantee someone else will ever agree to sell at the available &ldquo;limit prices&rdquo; or &ldquo;bids&rdquo; so you don&rsquo;t know how long your order will &ldquo;sit&rdquo; before it&rsquo;s ever taken.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>For example, if you place a buy limit order for BTC?USD with a limit price of 1 USD, you might die of old age before you ever find someone willing to sell you bitcoin at that price&hellip;unless the crypto market experiences the greatest crash ever. üò±</p>
    <p>Assuming that doesn&rsquo;t happen, your &ldquo;bid&rdquo; will just &ldquo;rest&rdquo; or &ldquo;sit&rdquo; in the order book until you manually cancel the order.</p>
    <h2>What if I want to sell?</h2>
    <p>If you already own some bitcoins and want to&nbsp;<strong>sell&nbsp;</strong>BTC/USD, you can either:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Place a sell limit order on the sell side (red text)</li>
    <li>Take the best bid on the buy side (green text)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Since the best bid price on the sell side is&nbsp;<strong>29968.79</strong>USD, you can instantly &ldquo;take&rdquo; that price by placing a &ldquo;<strong>market order</strong>&ldquo;.And say goodbye to 0.0474 of your bitcoin. üëã</p>
    <p>Otherwise, you would need to place (or &ldquo; make&rdquo;) a sell &ldquo;<strong>limit order</strong>&rdquo; specifying a &ldquo;<strong>limit price</strong>&rdquo; that is more than or equal to&nbsp;<strong>29.969.62&nbsp;</strong>USD on the sell side.</p>
    <p>Typically, a crypto exchange will charge a higher fee if you &ldquo;<strong>take</strong>&rdquo; an order versus if you &ldquo;<strong>make</strong>&rdquo; or place a limit order for others to &ldquo;take&rdquo;.</p>
    <p>This fee model used by crypto exchanges is known as the &ldquo;<strong>maker-taker</strong>&rdquo; fee model and will be discussed in more detail in the next lesson.</p>
