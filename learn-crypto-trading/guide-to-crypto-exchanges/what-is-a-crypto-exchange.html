    <p>What&rsquo;s a crypto exchange?</p>
    <p>If you&rsquo;ve read the previous lessons from my &ldquo;Beginner&rsquo;s Guide to Bitcoin Wallets&ldquo;, you&rsquo;ve learned what a crypto wallet is, how to set one up, and how to send and receive bitcoin.</p>
    <p>But if you don&rsquo;t have any bitcoins, how do you get some?</p>
    <p><strong>How do you&nbsp;<em>buy</em>&nbsp;bitcoin?</strong></p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/06/01122656/buy-and-sell-bitcoin.png" /></p>
    <p>In order to buy bitcoin, you&rsquo;ll need to open an account with a &ldquo;<strong>crypto exchange&rdquo;</strong>.</p>
    <p>A crypto exchange is where buyers and sellers can trade crypto. The crypto exchange provides you with a&nbsp;<strong>trading platform</strong>, usually in the form of a web or mobile &ldquo;app&rdquo;, where you can buy and sell crypto.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Crypto exchanges are known as&nbsp;<strong>crypto asset trading platforms (CTPs)</strong>.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Before crypto exchanges, people were only able to acquire bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies) through mining or by negotiating individual transactions on online forums, or even&nbsp;<strong>face-to-face transactions</strong>&nbsp;in the real world.</p>
    <p>Nowadays,&nbsp;<strong>most crypto beginners enter the world of crypto through an exchange</strong>. These companies make it easy for you to buy bitcoin quickly with just a couple of clicks.</p>
    <p>There are A LOT of different exchanges operating with some more focused on beginners to the crypto markets, whiles others are designed for more experienced crypto traders.</p>
    <p>Different exchanges support different cryptocurrencies so you may need to use multiple crypto exchanges depending on what you want to buy or sell.</p>
    <p>This guide will introduce you to what crypto exchanges are and help you find one that&rsquo;s right for you.</p>
    <h2>What is a crypto exchange?</h2>
    <p>Crypto exchanges are websites and apps where you can exchange one cryptocurrency you own for another.</p>
    <p>More specifically, a cryptocurrency exchange is an online trading platform where you can buy, sell and trade cryptocurrencies.</p>
    <p>These trading platforms are defined as an &ldquo;<strong>exchange</strong>&rdquo; because their role is to simply MATCH buyers and sellers and are not involved in the transaction. They do take d charge a fee for facilitating each transaction.</p>
    <p>Depending on the crypto exchange, you can use traditional fiat currency like U.S. dollars to buy a cryptocurrency. For example, you can buy bitcoin (BTC) with U.S. dollars (USD).</p>
    <p>Or you can use other cryptocurrencies. For example, if you already have some bitcoins, you can buy litecoin (LTC) with your bitcoins (BTC).</p>
    <p>In a nutshell, a crypto exchange allows you to:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Buy</strong>&nbsp;bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies</li>
    <li><strong>Convert</strong>&nbsp;cryptocurrencies you own for other cryptocurrencies</li>
    <li><strong>Sell</strong>&nbsp;your cryptocurrencies and withdraw</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>What are the different types of crypto exchanges?</h2>
    <p>In general, the term &ldquo;exchange&rdquo; is used to describe any trading platform that allows the&nbsp;<em>exchange</em>&nbsp;of currencies.</p>
    <p>But in crypto, there are actually two types of exchanges:</p>
    <ol>
    <li><strong>Centralized</strong>&nbsp;crypto exchanges (CEX)</li>
    <li><strong>Decentralized</strong>&nbsp;crypto exchanges (DEX)</li>
    </ol>
    <p>But which one is best for beginners? Let&rsquo;s quickly do a high-level overview on both to see which option makes more sense.</p>
    <h3>Centralized Exchange</h3>
    <p>A&nbsp;<strong>centralized crypto exchange (CEX)</strong>&nbsp;is typically an online business where users can create an account to buy/sell, send/receive and store native cryptocurrencies like bitcoin (BTC). This is pretty similar to forex and stock trading platforms in traditional finance (&ldquo;TradFi&rdquo;).</p>
    <p>The assets on the centralized platform are under the custody of the business. Because a CEX has so much control over user funds, these businesses are usually highly regulated.</p>
    <p>Complying with financial regulations where they operate gives them the privilege to allow users to be able to connect their bank accounts in order to fund their CEX accounts.</p>
    <h3>Decentralized Exchange</h3>
    <p>A<strong>&nbsp;decentralized crypto exchange (DEX)</strong>&nbsp;is where crypto traders conduct transactions directly with one another.</p>
    <p>It is considered an alternative to traditional, centralized exchanges.</p>
    <p>A DEX is not controlled by any one person or entity and is essentially a software program or app running on the internet.</p>
    <p>A user would&nbsp;<strong>connect their self-custodial crypto wallet to a DEX</strong>&nbsp;to exchange or &ldquo;<strong>swap</strong>&rdquo; their crypto assets. Trades are executed in an automated process by the software code. without the need for an intermediary.</p>
    <p>Algorithms, coded as smart contracts, are used to determine the prices of cryptocurrencies relative to others</p>
    <p>Unlike CEX transactions which are handled internally, DEX transactions are settled directly on the blockchain.</p>
    <p>Users have complete control of their crypto assets during this whole process with a DEX.</p>
    <p>It is trustless, permissionless, and open source, all meaning that it&rsquo;s open to anyone to interact with at any time.</p>
    <p>But with no central authority and/or no government oversight of a DEX, the user can&rsquo;t connect to their bank account and there is no customer service support if any issues arise.</p>
    <h2>CEX or DEX?</h2>
    <p>Both CEXs and DEXs charge trading fees and the user experience is relatively simple for both platforms, although centralized exchanges are better known to have a more user-friendly experience, as well as provide customer service.</p>
    <p>Due to the ability to deposit and withdraw fiat currency, access to customer support, and operating under regulatory oversight,&nbsp;I&rsquo;d recommend that beginners first start with a&nbsp;<strong>centralized crypto exchange (CEX)</strong>.</p>
    <p><strong>A DEX is more for advanced users and has a different set of risks</strong>. Using a DEX requires more technical skill and familiarity with decentralized finance (DeFi).</p>
    <p>For the rest of this beginner&rsquo;s guide,&nbsp;<strong>I&rsquo;ll stay focused on CEXs</strong>&nbsp;and dive more into DEXs and DeFi in future lessons.</p>
