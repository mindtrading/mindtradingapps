    <p>What is KYC?</p>
    <p>I know what you might be thinking&hellip;</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/05/18221916/know-your-customer.png" /></p>
    <p>Nope. Sorry.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s NOT a new kind of Kentucky chicken. ðŸ˜‚</p>
    <h2>What is KYC?</h2>
    <p>When opening an account, you may notice that the crypto exchange requires you to complete something called a&nbsp;<strong>&ldquo;KYC&rdquo; verification&nbsp;process</strong>.</p>
    <p>Crypto exchanges in the U.S. and many other countries are subject to&nbsp;<strong>anti-money laundering (AML)</strong>&nbsp;banking laws and regulations.</p>
    <p>In order to comply with these regulations, crypto exchanges must gather specific information about their customers. This process is typically known as &ldquo;<strong>KYC</strong>&rdquo; which stands for&rdquo;<strong>Know Your Customer</strong>&ldquo;.</p>
    <p>This means that you will have to provide personal information that confirms your identity.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/05/18220003/kyc-photo-id-1.png" /></p>
    <p>In order to prevent funds from being used for fraud, money laundering, terrorist financing, posing as a fake German heiress, and other illegal activity, exchanges have to take things a few steps further than your barista asking for your coffee drink and nickname.</p>
    <p>By collecting information about the identity of their customers, a database is created that law enforcement agencies can use in their investigations in the case of some future criminal activity.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/05/18220533/anti-money-laundering-360x360.png" /></p>
    <p><strong>&ldquo;Know Your Customer&rdquo;(KYC) isn&rsquo;t unique to crypto and applies to almost ALL financial institutions that hold customer funds.</strong></p>
    <p>For example, you actually go through a KYC process even when opening a bank account, or applying for a credit card, car loan, or mortgage.</p>
    <p>There are&nbsp;<strong>different levels of KYC</strong>&nbsp;ranging from zero KYC to super thorough KYC.</p>
    <p>Although some crypto exchanges may still allow users to deposit funds without going through KYC, they are becoming a dying breed as it becomes a global standard. Nowadays,&nbsp;<strong>most major crypto exchanges require KYC as soon as a new user opens an account</strong>.</p>
    <h2>How does KYC work?</h2>
    <p>When you sign up for an account on an exchange, you will have to provide your basic information such as:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Your full name</li>
    <li>Your date of birth</li>
    <li>Your address</li>
    <li>Your email address</li>
    <li>Your phone number</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This information is needed to ensure that the exchange meets requirements under&nbsp;<strong>Anti-Money Laundering (AML)</strong>&nbsp;regulations.</p>
    <p>The purpose of AML regulations is to prevent people from<strong>&nbsp;hiding the origin, flow, and destination</strong>&nbsp;of electronic money transfers so that law enforcement agencies can&nbsp;<strong>track the flow of illicit funds.&nbsp;</strong></p>
    <p>You can&rsquo;t hide if you have to reveal your identity.</p>
    <p>Depending on the trading platform or the local laws, the exchange can also ask for additional information such as:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Your source of income</li>
    <li>Your social security number</li>
    <li>A government-issued photo ID such as a driver&rsquo;s license or passport</li>
    <li>Proof of address such as a copy of your utility bill</li>
    <li>A photo of yourself (selfie)</li>
    <li>A facial biometric scan (video selfie)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/05/18215552/kyc-selfie-360x360.png"  /></p>
    <p>While the initial sign-up process is usually automated, financial institutions have client services teams (actual human beings) tasked with double-checking that the information provided is accurate. You might even get a call from them, too!</p>
    <p>To find out a crypto exchange&rsquo;s specific KYC requirements and how long you can expect the verification process to take, look for the customer support section on their website.</p>
    <p>Lastly, it&rsquo;s also common for exchanges to have more KYC requirements for<strong>&nbsp;larger account sizes or big transactions</strong>. They&rsquo;re just making sure that the funds are from legit sources and that there&rsquo;s nothing shady going on!</p>
    <p>Other crypto exchanges require the same KYC process regardless of the value of the funds that you wish to deposit or withdraw.</p>
    <p>As you can see, it&rsquo;s a lot of personal information you&rsquo;ll need to disclose.</p>
    <p><strong>That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s important to make sure you&rsquo;re dealing with a trustworthy crypto exchange!</strong></p>
    <p>While KYC might seem like a hassle for you, you probably don&rsquo;t have a choice.</p>
    <p>With&nbsp;<strong>billions of dollars</strong>&nbsp;entering the crypto market from various sources, more governments are forcing crypto exchanges to comply with their Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) processes.</p>
