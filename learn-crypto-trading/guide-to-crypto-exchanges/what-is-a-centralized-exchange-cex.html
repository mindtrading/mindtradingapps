    <p>What is a centralized crypto exchange (CEX)?</p>
    <p>A centralized crypto exchange (CEX) is a business that provides you with a multitude of services such as a&nbsp;<strong>crypto trading platform&nbsp;</strong>(buy and sell transactions),<strong>&nbsp;account services</strong>&nbsp;(account funding and withdrawal), and&nbsp;<strong>customer support services.</strong></p>
    <p>Centralized exchanges remain the most widely used method to buy and sell crypto.</p>
    <p>They are attractive to many crypto users since they are considered to be more convenient and easier to use than a decentralized exchange (DEX).</p>
    <h2>What is a Centralized Crypto Exchange (CEX)?</h2>
    <p>A&nbsp;<strong>centralized exchange (CEX</strong>) allows any person with an internet connection to discover and transact with crypto assets.</p>
    <p>It is owned and operated by a private company and requires users to sign up and open an account in order to participate.</p>
    <p>CEXs facilitate transactions of crypto assets between buyers and sellers. by providing an<strong>&nbsp;online trading platform</strong>&nbsp;that maintains an&nbsp;<strong>order book</strong>: a collection of buy and sell orders posted by individual traders.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p><em>Orders</em>&nbsp;are requests to buy or sell a certain amount of a specific cryptocurrency at a specified price.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>A CEX aggregates orders placed in the order book by its users and then uses special software to match and execute the corresponding buy and sell orders.</p>
    <p>Examples of centralized exchanges include Binance, Coinbase, Bybit, Gemini, Kraken, and Kucoin.</p>
    <h2>What does a Centralized Crypto Exchange (CEX) do?</h2>
    <p>A cryptocurrency exchange has three primary roles:</p>
    <h3>Order Matching</h3>
    <p>In a crypto exchange, buyers and sellers transact with each other. This means that you buy crypto from another user of the exchange rather than from the exchange itself.</p>
    <p>The exchange itself provides a PLACE for people who want to buy crypto AND for people who want to sell their crypto. It&nbsp;<strong>matches</strong>&nbsp;buyers and sellers.</p>
    <p>If a buyer wants to buy bitcoin (BTC) at $20,000 and a seller wants to sell bitcoin at $20,000, the exchange matches the orders of these two people.</p>
    <h3>Clearing Counterparty</h3>
    <p>The exchange also acts as a central clearing&nbsp;<em>counterparty</em>.</p>
    <p>This is just a fancy way of saying that all&nbsp;<strong>matched orders</strong>&nbsp;<em>appear</em>&nbsp;to be against the exchange ITSELF rather than between the users directly.&nbsp;This provides&nbsp;<strong>anonymity</strong>&nbsp;for both parties since the buyer won&rsquo;t know who the seller is and vice versa.</p>
    <p>Also, as the central clearing counterparty., the CEX handles the entire process of the transaction and ensures that all obligations are met between buyer and seller and that the transaction actually completes.</p>
    <p>For example, if you bought 1 bitcoin (BTC) for $20,000, the exchange ensures that you have $20,000 (USD) and that USD is transferred to the seller&rsquo;s account and the newly bought BTC is transferred to your account.</p>
    <p>You can&rsquo;t just take the bitcoin and disappear, and the seller can&rsquo;t take your U.S. dollars and disappear (and keep their bitcoin).</p>
    <h3>Custodian</h3>
    <p>The exchange also acts as a custodian for any cash and/or crypto held in your account.</p>
    <p>Some exchanges allow you to deposit fiat currencies, such as U.S. dollars or euros, while others only allow you to deposit cryptocurrencies like bitcoin (BTC) or ether (ETH).</p>
    <p>Whether it&rsquo;s fiat or crypto, once deposited, they are under the custody of t<strong>he exchange</strong>. This means that you&rsquo;re now trusting the exchange to keep your funds safe the same way you&rsquo;d trust a bank&rsquo;s vault to hold your money.</p>
    <p>Now that you&rsquo;ve learned what a centralized crypto exchange (CEX) is, let&rsquo;s learn how to choose a good one.</p>
