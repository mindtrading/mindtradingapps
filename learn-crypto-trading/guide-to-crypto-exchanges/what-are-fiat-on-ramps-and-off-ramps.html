    <p>If you&rsquo;re new to the crypto world, it won&rsquo;t be long until you come across the phrases, &ldquo;fiat on-ramps&rdquo; and &ldquo;fiat off-ramps&rdquo;.</p>
    <p>In this lesson, you&rsquo;ll learn what these phrases mean. üëç</p>
    <p>The process of transferring money between fiat and crypto is known as &ldquo;<strong>on-ramping&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;and &ldquo;<strong>off-ramping</strong>&rdquo;.</p>
    <p>If you&rsquo;ve ever bought crypto with fiat money, you&rsquo;d have used a &ldquo;<strong>fiat on-ramp</strong>&rdquo; (also known as a &ldquo;<strong>fiat gateway</strong>&ldquo;).</p>
    <p>Fiat on-ramps and off-ramps act like &ldquo;roads&rdquo;, connecting the fiat and crypto worlds.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/05/30103418/crypto-road-to-fiat-780x180.png" /></p>
    <p>Where&nbsp;<strong>on-ramps</strong>&nbsp;are a way to enable users to convert their fiat currency for cryptocurrencies, off-ramps are the opposite.</p>
    <p><strong>Off-ramps</strong>&nbsp;allow you to &ldquo;cash out&rdquo; your crypto by enabling you to exchange your crypto for fiat currency.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/05/30103133/fiat-off-ramp-crypto-1.png" /></p>
    <p>A simple way to think of fiat on-ramps and off-ramps is to imagine&nbsp;<strong>two roads</strong>. One road is part of the &ldquo;fiat world&rdquo; and the other road is part of the &ldquo;crypto world&rdquo;.</p>
    <p>If you&rsquo;re in the &ldquo;<strong>fiat world</strong>&rdquo; and wish to access the &ldquo;<strong>crypto world</strong>&ldquo;, you use an entrance ramp or &ldquo;<strong>on-ramp</strong>&rdquo;</p>
    <p>And if you&rsquo;re in the &ldquo;<strong>crypto world</strong>&rdquo; and wish to return to the &ldquo;<strong>fiat world</strong>&ldquo;, you use an exit ramp or &ldquo;<strong>off-ramp&rdquo;</strong></p>
    <p>Fiat on-ramps and off-ramps allow you to&nbsp;<strong>move your money back and forth</strong>&nbsp;between the fiat and crypto worlds.</p>
    <p>These &ldquo;ramps&rdquo; need to bring in&nbsp;<strong>new users</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>new money</strong>&nbsp;into the crypto market.</p>
    <h2>What is &ldquo;Fiat&rdquo;?</h2>
    <p>The term &ldquo;<strong>fiat</strong>&rdquo; is a Latin word that is often translated as &ldquo;it shall be&rdquo; or &ldquo;let it be done.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>In plain English, fiat is defined as &ldquo;the giving of orders by someone who has complete authority.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>In the context of money, modern governments issue &ldquo;<strong>fiat currency&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;to bused as the primary&nbsp;<em>money</em>&nbsp;in their economy.</p>
    <p>Fiat currency refers to a&nbsp;<strong>government-issued currency</strong>&nbsp;that has no intrinsic value because it&rsquo;s not backed by anything (such as commodities like gold or silver).</p>
    <p>For example,&nbsp;<strong>U.S. dollars</strong>&nbsp;is a fiat currency.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/05/21145327/dollar-bill-fiat-360x360.png" /></p>
    <p>So are the Japanese&nbsp;<strong>yen</strong>, Chinese&nbsp;<strong>yuan</strong>, British&nbsp;<strong>pound</strong>, Philippine&nbsp;<strong>peso</strong>, Swiss&nbsp;<strong>franc</strong>, Thai&nbsp;<strong>bath</strong>, Brazilian&nbsp;<strong>real</strong>, and South African&nbsp;<strong>rand</strong>.</p>
    <p>The only reason fiat currency is used as money is due to the fact that the government, using its authority, &ldquo;<strong>orders it so</strong>&rdquo; by authorizing the fiat currency to be established as&nbsp;<strong>legal tender</strong>.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/05/21145143/fiiat-currency-legal-tender-360x360.png" /></p>
    <p>Legal tender is anything recognized by law as a means to settle a public or private debt or meet a financial obligation, such as tax payments, contracts, and legal fines</p>
    <p>While governments may be in control of their fiat currency and maintain its supply, its value is entirely dependent on&nbsp;<strong>how holders perceive its value and utility</strong>.</p>
    <p>Basically, for fiat currency to function as money, holders must have faith it has value and will maintain this value.</p>
    <h2>What are fiat &ldquo;on-ramps&rdquo; and &ldquo;off-ramps&rdquo;?</h2>
    <p>Fiat on-ramp and off-ramps, also known as&nbsp;<strong>fiat gateways</strong>, are&nbsp;<em>gateways</em>&nbsp;into and out of the crypto world.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/05/21183352/fiat-ti-crypto-gateway-360x360.png" /></p>
    <p>While there are different types of fiat gateways such as bank transfers or credit card payments, generally speaking, any form of fiat deposit into the crypto market is a fiat gateway.</p>
    <h2>What is a Fiat On-Ramp?</h2>
    <p>If you want to get involved in bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, unless it&rsquo;s gifted to you, you have to buy some.</p>
    <p>And in order to buy some, this requires you to exchange the fiat currency you own for cryptocurrency.</p>
    <p>And in order to exchange fiat currency for cryptocurrency, you need to use an &ldquo;<strong>on-ramp</strong>&ldquo;.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/05/21182312/fiat-on-ramp-360x360.png" /></p>
    <p>A fiat &ldquo;on-ramp&rdquo; is a service that allows for the&nbsp;<strong>exchange of fiat currencies for cryptocurrencies</strong>.</p>
    <p>For example, you exchange USD (fiat currency) for BTC (cryptocurrency).</p>
    <p>Since most people hold fiat currency, exchanging fiat is the most accessible method of access to cryptocurrencies.</p>
    <p>On-ramps allow you to&nbsp;<strong><em>leave</em>&nbsp;the fiat-based monetary system and&nbsp;<em>enter</em>&nbsp;into the decentralized, blockchain-based monetary system</strong>&nbsp;instead.</p>
    <p>In other words, it&rsquo;s an&nbsp;<strong>&ldquo;on-ramp&rdquo; to the world of cryptocurrencies</strong>.</p>
    <h2>What is a Fiat Off-Ramp?</h2>
    <p>The opposite of an on-ramp is an off-ramp.</p>
    <p>An &ldquo;<strong>off-ramp</strong>&rdquo; is a service that allows for the exchange of cryptocurrencies for fiat.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/05/21182404/fiat-off-ramp-360x360.png" /></p>
    <p>The availability of an off-ramp assures users that they&rsquo;re not locked into a cryptocurrency and can &ldquo;exit&rdquo; (sell crypto for fiat) at any time.</p>
    <p>Off-ramps are complementary to on-ramps and serve a critical role in providing a way for you to bring your money back into the traditional world of fiat.</p>
    <p>Being able to fairly easily turn cryptocurrency back into fiat helps to increase new user adoption for crypto since they can &ldquo;get out&rdquo; if needed.</p>
    <p>On-ramps allow you to leave the&nbsp;<strong>traditional fiat monetary system</strong>&nbsp;and enter into the&nbsp;<strong>decentralized, blockchain-based monetary system</strong>&nbsp;instead.</p>
    <p>Off-ramps allow you to leave the decentralized, blockchain-monetary system and enter into the fiat-based monetary system instead.</p>
    <p>In other words, it&rsquo;s an&nbsp;<strong>&ldquo;off-ramp&rdquo; to the world of fiat currencies</strong>.</p>
