    <p>In order to send or receive bitcoins, you need to use a Bitcoin &ldquo;<strong>wallet</strong>&ldquo;.</p>
    <p>But unlike a wallet in the real world that actually holds your cash (and debit and credit cards), a Bitcoin wallet does NOT actually &ldquo;hold&rdquo; your bitcoins.</p>
    <p>Instead, a Bitcoin wallet is a&nbsp;<strong>hardware device or software program</strong>&nbsp;that<strong>&nbsp;interacts with Bitcoin&rsquo;s blockchain</strong>&nbsp;by providing the necessary information needed to create Bitcoin transactions.</p>
    <p>One piece of information is called a &ldquo;<strong>wallet addres</strong>s&rdquo; or simply an &ldquo;<strong>address</strong>&rdquo;.</p>
    <p>Bitcoin transactions can be described as the&nbsp;<strong>transfer of bitcoins from one address to&nbsp;<em>another</em>&nbsp;address</strong>.</p>
    <p>For example, let&rsquo;s say Kim wants to send some bitcoins to Kylie. Each of them will have a Bitcoin wallet which will generate an &ldquo;<strong>address</strong>&rdquo; for them.</p>
    <p>Kim will provide Kylie&rsquo;s Bitcoin address, and then her wallet will ask to authorize the transaction.</p>
    <p>And voila! The bitcoins will &ldquo;move&rdquo; from Kim&rsquo;s address to Kylie&rsquo;s address and this &ldquo;movement&rdquo; will be recorded on Bitcoin&rsquo;s blockchain.</p>
    <p>Sounds simple but there&rsquo;s a lot more going on behind the scenes.</p>
    <p>In this lesson, we&rsquo;re going to learn what exactly a crypto wallet is. I&rsquo;ll be talking about a Bitcoin wallet, but all crypto wallets work in a similar fashion.</p>
    <h2>What is a Bitcoin wallet?</h2>
    <p>Bitcoin wallets are totally different from physical wallets. Instead of storing money, Bitcoin wallets store something called &ldquo;&nbsp;<strong>keys</strong>&rdquo;.</p>
    <p>And one of those keys known as a &ldquo;<strong>private key</strong>&rdquo; is what allows you to send (&ldquo;move&rdquo;) your bitcoins to another address.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/03/06140535/bitcoin-wallet-holds-private-key.png" /></p>
    <p>As you start using bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, it is important to learn how wallets work.</p>
    <p>When dealing with crypto wallets, you will come across terms like &ldquo;<strong>private key</strong>&ldquo;, &ldquo;<strong>public key</strong>&ldquo;, &ldquo;<strong>address</strong>&ldquo;, and &ldquo;s<strong>eed phrase</strong>&ldquo;.</p>
    <p>Wallet software often attempts to shield you from the need to understand what these terms are and how they work. But a&nbsp;<strong>basic understanding of key concepts</strong>&nbsp;underlying crypto wallets can help prevent you from making mistakes that could cost you money.</p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s learn what all this wallet lingo is all about and how they all work together.</p>
    <h2>What are a private key, a public key, and an address?</h2>
    <p>To send and receive money online, you usually need an &ldquo;account number&rdquo; and a &ldquo;password&rdquo;.</p>
    <p>In the Bitcoin world, this is called a&rdquo;&nbsp;<strong>public key&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;and a &ldquo;<strong>private key</strong>&ldquo;.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/02/28200432/public-and-private-key.png" /></p>
    <p>Bitcoin uses a<strong>&nbsp;&ldquo;two-key system&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;in which the&nbsp;<strong>public key</strong>&nbsp;allows you to RECEIVE bitcoins, while the&nbsp;<strong>private key</strong>&nbsp;is needed to SEND bitcoins.</p>
    <p>The two keys are&nbsp;<strong>connected to each other in&nbsp;<em>mathematical</em>&nbsp;terms</strong>.</p>
    <p>The &ldquo;<strong>private ke</strong>y&rdquo; is a unique secret number that only you know.</p>
    <p>It is used to &ldquo;sign&rdquo; transactions. These &ldquo;digital signatures&rdquo; are required in order to send bitcoin. (More on &ldquo;digital signatures&rdquo; in a later lesson.)</p>
    <p>This &ldquo;<strong>public key</strong>&rdquo; is a crazy long number so a&nbsp;<strong>shortened version of the public key is used instead</strong>&nbsp;making it much easier to read.</p>
    <p>This &ldquo;compressed format&rdquo; or shortened version of the public key is called the&nbsp;<strong>address</strong>.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/02/28200655/address-publick-key.png" /></p>
    <p>A &ldquo;<strong>Bitcoin address</strong>&rdquo;, or simply &ldquo;<strong>address</strong>&rdquo;, is a string of 26-35 alphanumeric characters, beginning with the number 1 or 3 or &ldquo;bc&rdquo;.</p>
    <p>Here&rsquo;s an example of an address:</p>
    <pre>1AYJ2fXPABrS7RXqH2dfcAMwHAXk5Nrtoc</pre>
    <p>It can also be shown as a QR code:</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/03/06134529/publick-key-qr-code-150x150.png" /></p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>A QR code (which stands for &ldquo;Quick Response&rdquo;) is a graphical representation of the address that can be read by your mobile phone&rsquo;s camera.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>When you want to send bitcoins to a friend, you ask your friend for their &ldquo;Bitcoin address&rdquo;. It can be&nbsp;<strong>freely shared</strong>&nbsp;with the public and anyone can potentially send bitcoins to them.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, and as its name suggests,&nbsp;<strong>a private key should be kept private</strong>.</p>
    <p>But if you&rsquo;re curious, here&rsquo;s what a private key looks like:</p>
    <pre>L5eb3xFcPHSoSytWm77UVgC6vRk4pNrhjQMQNwfootvYnzZQLXJh</pre>
    <p>(Please be nice and don&rsquo;t steal my bitcoins!)</p>
    <p>Think of it as a password that gives you the ability to prove ownership and spend the bitcoins associated with your address, similar to how you would use a password to access your bank account.</p>
    <p>You should NEVER, under any circumstances, share your private key(s) with any other person.</p>
    <p>No one should ever see your private key because the person that knows the private key controls the funds in a wallet address. If someone steals your private key, there is no way to prove that the bitcoins are yours.</p>
    <p>And voil&agrave;! That&rsquo;s the role of the private key, the public key, and the address.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Your&nbsp;<strong>public key</strong>&nbsp;is like your &ldquo;account number&rdquo;.</li>
    <li>Your&nbsp;<strong>address</strong>&nbsp;is a shorter version of your account number. This is the one you give out to people to send you some bitcoin.</li>
    <li>Your&nbsp;<strong>private key</strong>&nbsp;is like your &ldquo;password&rdquo; that proves ownership of the bitcoins associated with a given address.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The sender needs the&nbsp;<strong>recipient&rsquo;s address</strong>&nbsp;to be able to send bitcoins to the recipient. Once the bitcoins are in the recipient&rsquo;s address, he/she will then be able to spend or withdraw them with his/her private key.</p>
    <h2>Where do keys and addresses come from?</h2>
    <h3>Private Key</h3>
    <p>It all starts with the private key, which is just a&nbsp;<strong>randomly generated number</strong>:</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/02/28201237/private-key-is-random-number.png" /></p>
    <p>This long number is shortened by converting it into hexadecimal format.</p>
    <p><strong>Hexadecimal</strong>&nbsp;is a numbering system where&nbsp;<strong>16 possible digits</strong>&nbsp;are used to represent numbers.</p>
    <p>The first ten digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9; represent the same value you&rsquo;re used to.</p>
    <p>The remaining six digits are represented by A, B, C, D, E, and F, which map out to values of 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/02/28201413/hexadecimal.png" /></p>
    <p>So a single hexadecimal digit can show 16 different values instead of the normal 10.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/02/28201633/hexadecimal-converter.png"  /></p>
    <p>And that is a private key&hellip; just&nbsp;<strong>a big random number</strong>&nbsp;in hexadecimal format.</p>
    <p>A private key can be any number between 1 and 115792089237316195423570985008687907852837564279074904382605163141518161494337.</p>
    <h3>Public Key</h3>
    <p>Your&nbsp;<strong>public key</strong>&nbsp;is DERIVED from your&nbsp;<strong>private key</strong>.</p>
    <p>But wait a minute, the public key is uh public! It can be seen by other people.</p>
    <p>Doesn&rsquo;t this mean that people will also be able to see my private key?!</p>
    <p>Nope.</p>
    <p>While the public key is created from the private key,&nbsp;<strong>you can&rsquo;t work in reverse</strong>&nbsp;and try to figure out the private key.</p>
    <p>How come? Well, it&rsquo;s complicated. Let&rsquo;s just say that an algorithm, based on something called elliptic curve cryptography&nbsp;(ECC). prevents you from figuring out the private key even if you know the public key.</p>
    <p>Basically, your private key is protected by some serious&nbsp;<strong>math</strong>.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/02/28202150/publick-key-derived-form-private-key-780x507.png" /></p>
    <p>A private key and a public key are&nbsp;<strong>mathematically linked</strong>. So while it&rsquo;s very easy to produce a public key from a private key, it&rsquo;s practically impossible to produce the private key from a public key.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>A private key can be converted into a public key, but a public key can&rsquo;t be converted back into a private key.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h3>Address</h3>
    <p>The public key is then &ldquo;compressed&rdquo; to make it shorter and easier to use.</p>
    <p>So think of an address as a shorter and (slightly)&nbsp;<strong>easier-to-read representation of the public key</strong>.</p>
    <p>In summary,&nbsp;<strong>the private key generates the public key, which in turn, is compressed and shortened to form the public address</strong>.</p>
    <p>The relationship between private key, public key, and Bitcoin address is shown below:</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/02/28202515/relationship-between-keys-and-addresses.png"  /></p>
    <p>But each step is&nbsp;<strong>irreversible</strong>.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/02/28202625/relationship-between-keys-and-addresses-irreversible.png" /></p>
    <p>Each step is considered a &ldquo;one-way function&rdquo;, which means it&rsquo;s incredibly difficult for a computer to reverse each operation and figure out the data from the previous step.</p>
    <h2>How are the keys and addresses generated?</h2>
    <p>If you haven&rsquo;t noticed, it all starts with the private key. And while it&rsquo;s possible to try and do it yourself,<strong>&nbsp;private keys are usually generated by your Bitcoin wallet</strong>. It&rsquo;s all done behind the scenes but it&rsquo;s still good to have a high-level understanding of the process.</p>
    <p>Here&rsquo;s some artwork to help you visualize the process of generating a private/public key pair and corresponding address:</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/02/28212508/key-generation-process.png" /></p>
    <ol>
    <li>The wallet software generates a&nbsp;<strong>random number</strong>.</li>
    <li>This random number becomes the&nbsp;<strong>private key</strong>.</li>
    <li>The wallet software will use this private key to automatically generate the&nbsp;<strong>public key</strong>.</li>
    <li>With this public key, an&nbsp;<strong>address</strong>&nbsp;will then be generated.</li>
    <li>Congratulations! You now have a brand new address to send and receive bitcoins!</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>What happens if you lose your private key?</h2>
    <p>Losing your private key is similar to losing your cash.</p>
    <p>Once it&rsquo;s gone, it&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>gone</em>!</p>
    <p><strong>It is IMPOSSIBLE to figure out your private key from either your public key or address.</strong></p>
    <p>And you need your private key to&nbsp;<strong>move or spend your bitcoins!&nbsp;</strong></p>
    <p>So if you lose your private key, ALL bitcoins stored on the address associated with this private key will be locked there for eternity.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/02/28205408/bitcoin-locked.png" /></p>
    <p>In order to spend the bitcoins, you need a &ldquo;<strong>digital signature</strong>&rdquo; to authorize the transaction, and in order to create a digital signature, you need your&nbsp;<strong>private key</strong>.</p>
    <p>So without a private key&hellip;no &ldquo;digital signature&rdquo;&hellip;.without a &ldquo;digital signature&rdquo;&hellip;.<strong>no transaction</strong>.</p>
    <p>Complicated math is used to ensure that a private key is not able to be figured out from the public key, especially since the public key (displayed in the format of an &ldquo;<strong>address&rdquo;</strong>) can be seen by everyone on the Bitcoin network.</p>
    <p>While this approach is very unforgiving, at least you know that nobody or no entity, like the government, can go behind your back and seize your bitcoins.</p>
    <p>There is only one private key to access your bitcoins, and&nbsp;<strong>you, and only YOU, are totally responsible for it</strong>.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/08/12182603/you-are-responsible-for-private-key.png" /></p>
    <p>If you lose or forget it, you have nobody else to blame&hellip;except YOSELF.</p>
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Public and private keys are always created in pairs.</li>
    <li>The&nbsp;<strong>public key</strong>&nbsp;is used to RECEIVE bitcoins.</li>
    <li>Due to its length, it is compressed into a format known as the&nbsp;<strong>address</strong></li>
    <li>The address is similar to an account number of a bank account.</li>
    <li>The&nbsp;<strong>private key</strong>&nbsp;is what authorizes you to control funds attached to an address and initiate transactions from that address.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As you can see, &ldquo;storing&rdquo; bitcoins simply refers to the&nbsp;<strong>safekeeping of private keys</strong>.</p>
