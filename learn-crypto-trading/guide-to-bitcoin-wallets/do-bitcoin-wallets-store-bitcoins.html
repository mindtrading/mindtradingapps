        <p>What does it actually mean to &ldquo;store crypto&rdquo;?</p>
        <p>A popular misconception about crypto wallets is that they&nbsp;<strong>contain</strong>&nbsp;or actually&nbsp;<strong>store</strong>&nbsp;actual crypto.</p>
        <p>In Bitcoin&rsquo;s case, this means that some people believe that Bitcoin wallets actually contain bitcoins.</p>
        <p>But this is false.</p>
        <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/08/15161537/confused-about-crypto-wallets-360x360.png" alt="" /></p>
        <p>Unlike a physical wallet in the real world which holds cash, a Bitcoin wallet does NOT actually hold your bitcoins.</p>
        <p>It can&rsquo;t.</p>
        <p>Why not?</p>
        <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/02/28194206/crypto-is-digital.png" alt="" /></p>
        <p>Because, unlike cash, bitcoins&nbsp;<strong>don&rsquo;t exist in&nbsp;<em>physical</em>&nbsp;form</strong>. They&rsquo;re&nbsp;<strong>digital</strong>. You can&rsquo;t physically store something that doesn&rsquo;t&nbsp;<em>physically</em>&nbsp;exist!</p>
        <h2>Bitcoins are just numbers.</h2>
        <p>Bitcoins are simply represented by&nbsp;<strong><em>numbers</em>&nbsp;on a ledger</strong>&hellip;Bitcoin&rsquo;s blockchain.</p>
        <p>When I say, &ldquo;<strong>I own 3 bitcoins</strong>.&rdquo;, what this really means is that we can look at Bitcoin&rsquo;s blockchain (which is public), look up my address (which was generated by my Bitcoin wallet)., and see that I have&nbsp;<strong>3 bitcoins associated with this address</strong>.</p>
        <p>A helpful way to think about how a Bitcoin wallet works is to imagine that you have a real-world wallet that doesn&rsquo;t hold any cash but holds just a&nbsp;<strong>debit card</strong>.</p>
        <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/02/28182428/card-wallet-360x360.png" alt="" /></p>
        <p>If you&rsquo;re not familiar with a debit card, it&rsquo;s a rectangular piece of plastic that looks like a credit card except that it&rsquo;s linked to the user&rsquo;s checking account at a bank.</p>
        <p>A debit card (also known as a &ldquo;check card&rdquo; or &ldquo;bank card&rdquo;) is a&nbsp;<strong>payment card</strong>&nbsp;used to buy goods or services. that&nbsp;<strong>deducts money directly from your checking account when it&rsquo;s used</strong>.</p>
        <p>The&nbsp;<strong>amount of money that can be spent with it is tied to the account balance</strong>&nbsp;(the amount of funds in your checking account).</p>
        <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/02/28182617/cashier-360x360.png" alt="" /></p>
        <p>So when you&rsquo;re at the checkout counter at the grocery store, and it&rsquo;s time to pay, you grab your wallet from your pocket or purse, whip out your debit card, and swipe or insert it at the terminal.</p>
        <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/02/28182705/debit-card-in-hand-360x360.png" alt="" /></p>
        <p>The cashier will either ask you to enter a personal identification number (PIN) or give you a slip to sign.</p>
        <p>Your PIN number or signing your name (signature) is how you &ldquo;prove&rdquo; you are you and are authorizing the spending of your funds from your checking account.</p>
        <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/02/28182737/card-terminal-360x360.png" alt="" /></p>
        <p>As you can see,&nbsp;<strong>your money is not stored on your debit card</strong>. What the debit card provides is &ldquo;access&rdquo; to the funds in your checking account.</p>
        <p>And with your PIN or signature, which &ldquo;proves&rdquo; you are the owner of the checking account, you can &ldquo;unlock&rdquo; the funds sitting in your checking account&hellip;.and &ldquo;spend&rdquo; the funds.</p>
        Your checking account is just part of a digital ledger of the bank, so &ldquo;spending&rdquo; your funds just means that money is moved from your checking account to another account.
        <p>In this case, the grocery store&rsquo;s bank account.</p>
        <p>So if you think about it, if the only thing your wallet holds is a debit card, your wallet is NOT storing any actual money.</p>
        <p>What it&rsquo;s actually storing is&nbsp;<strong>something (the debit card) that gives you &ldquo;access&rdquo; to your money</strong>.</p>
        <p>For example, U.S. dollars do not physically exist on debit cards. The debit card does not &ldquo;store&rdquo; your dollars. But the debit card gives you &ldquo;access&rdquo; to the U.S. dollars you own in your checking account.</p>
        <p><strong>Your money isn&rsquo;t stored &ldquo;in&rdquo; your debit card.</strong></p>
        <p>Your money since it&rsquo;s digital (or electronic) is represented by your checking account balance, which are just&nbsp;<strong>numbers recorded on a digital ledger</strong>&nbsp;(or database) that&rsquo;s stored on your bank&rsquo;s server.</p>
        <p>If you lose your debit card or accidentally burn it or flush it down the toilet, you don&rsquo;t lose your money.</p>
        <p>A Bitcoin wallet works in a similar fashion with a couple of differences.</p>
        <p>Instead of a checking account, Bitcoin uses &ldquo;<strong>addresses</strong>&rdquo; to represent account numbers. A Bitcoin address is where bitcoins (BTC) can be&nbsp;<strong>RECEIVED</strong>&nbsp;and from which they can be&nbsp;<strong>SENT to&nbsp;<em>other</em>&nbsp;addresses</strong>.</p>
        <p>And rather than holding a debit card, a Bitcoin wallet holds something called a &ldquo;<strong>private ke</strong>y&rdquo;.</p>
        <p>So a Bitcoin wallet does NOT store bitcoins,&nbsp;<strong>it stores a private key(s)</strong>.</p>
        <p>A private key is just a string of digits. This private key is like a debit card in the sense that&nbsp;<strong>if you are in&nbsp;<em>possession</em>&nbsp;of it</strong>, you have&nbsp;<strong>access to a specific&nbsp;<em>address</em>&nbsp;and can &ldquo;spend&rdquo; any bitcoins that are tied to that&nbsp;<em>address</em></strong>.</p>
        <p>Just like a debit card and knowledge of your PIN &ldquo;proves&rdquo; you are the owner of a specific checking account, a private key &ldquo;proves&rdquo; you are the owner of a specific Bitcoin address.</p>
        <p>And just like a&nbsp;<strong>checking account is part of a big digital ledger</strong>&nbsp;that keeps track of transactions from all the bank&rsquo;s customer accounts, a Bitcoin&nbsp;<strong>address is part of a big digital ledger</strong>&nbsp;that keeps track of all Bitcoin transactions that occur from all Bitcoin addresses.&nbsp;This digital ledger is Bitcoin&rsquo;s&nbsp;<strong>blockchain</strong>.</p>
        <p>As mentioned earlier, with a PIN or signature, is how a debit cardholder authorizes a transaction, which simply allows money to be &ldquo;moved&rdquo; from their checking account to another person&rsquo;s or entity&rsquo;s checking account, which is all recorded on the bank&rsquo;s digital ledger.</p>
        <p>In Bitcoin&rsquo;s case, instead of a PIN or a handwritten signature, Bitcoin relies on a &ldquo;digital signature&rdquo;.</p>
        <p>Creating a &ldquo;digital signature&rdquo;, is how a private key holder authorizes a Bitcoin&nbsp;<strong>transaction,</strong>&nbsp;which simply means bitcoin(s) is &ldquo;moved&rdquo; from the sender&rsquo;s Bitcoin address to the recipient&rsquo;s Bitcoin address, and this&nbsp;<strong>&ldquo;movement&rdquo; of bitcoins from one addressed to another address</strong>&nbsp;is permanently recorded on Bitcoin&rsquo;s blockchain.</p>
        <p>It&rsquo;s not a perfect analogy since there are technical differences in the way money is actually &ldquo;moved&rdquo; between the two but the point is&hellip;</p>
        <p><strong>Bitcoins are NOT stored in the wallet.&nbsp;</strong>Bitcoins are<strong>&nbsp;assigned to addresses</strong>&nbsp;that are listed on Bitcoin&rsquo;s blockchain.</p>
        <h2>A Bitcoin wallet doesn&rsquo;t store bitcoins but grants&nbsp;<em>access</em>&nbsp;to your bitcoins.</h2>
        <p>A wallet manages the private key that&nbsp;<strong>grants access to the address</strong>&nbsp;where your bitcoins are stored.</p>
        <p>What you have is a private key that allows you to&nbsp;<em>prove</em>&nbsp;you are the owner of an address and can &ldquo;spend&rdquo; any bitcoins tied to an address.</p>
        <p>Think of bitcoins&nbsp;<strong>assigned to an address</strong>&nbsp;and that information is recorded on the blockchain (ledger). To be able to unlock and move the bitcoins to&nbsp;<strong>another address</strong>, you need the&nbsp;<strong>private key</strong>&nbsp;associated with the current address.</p>
