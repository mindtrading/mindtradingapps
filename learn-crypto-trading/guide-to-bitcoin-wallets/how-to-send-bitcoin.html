        <p>How do you send bitcoins?</p>
        <p>Fortunately, just like sending NSFW selfies, sending bitcoin is a pretty simple process.</p>
        <p>In order to send or receive bitcoins, you need a &ldquo;<strong>wallet</strong>&rdquo;.</p>
        <p>The exact process for sending bitcoins will depend on the type of Bitcoin wallet that you&rsquo;re using, but the main thing you&rsquo;ll need is the &ldquo;&lsquo;<strong>address</strong>&ldquo;&lsquo; of the recipient.</p>
        <p>Similar to an email address, the address specifies the&nbsp;<strong>location</strong>&nbsp;to which bitcoins can be sent.</p>
        <p>A Bitcoin address is an&nbsp;<strong>alphanumeric string&nbsp;</strong>(a string of letters and numbers).</p>
        <p>Here are some examples to give you an idea of what they look like:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>1FeexV6bAHb8ybZjqQMjJrcCrHGW9sb6uF</li>
        <li>34xp4vRoCGJym3xR7yCVPFHoCNxv4Twseo</li>
        <li>bc1qa5wkgaew2dkv56kfvj49j0av5nml45x9ek9hz6</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A&nbsp;<strong>transaction</strong>&nbsp;is a single instance of bitcoins being sent to a&nbsp;<em>specific</em>&nbsp;address</p>
        <p>So all transactions are associated with an address.</p>
        <h2>How do I send bitcoin?</h2>
        <p>Here&rsquo;s a step-by-step guide on how to send bitcoin:</p>
        <h3>Step 1: Create a Transaction</h3>
        <p>To send bitcoins, you enter the recipient&rsquo;s address by simply copy-and-pasting it in the wallet app.</p>
        <p>If you&rsquo;re using a mobile wallet or app, and you&rsquo;re physically in front of the recipient, you can just&nbsp;<strong>ask for their QR code</strong>, which is just a graphical representation of the address.</p>
        <p>It&rsquo;ll look something like this:</p>
        <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/08/13011343/mobile-crypto-wallet-360x360.png" /></p>
        <p>Then, you can use your phone&rsquo;s camera and scan the QR code.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Keep in mind that all Bitcoin transactions are irreversible. This means that if you send them to the wrong address, you&rsquo;ll most likely never see that bitcoin again. So always make you&rsquo;re sending to the correct address!</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Once you&rsquo;ve entered the recipient&rsquo;s address, you enter the amount of BTC you&rsquo;d like to send.</p>
        <p>Make sure you are using the&nbsp;<strong>correct currency</strong>. You don&rsquo;t want to accidentally send 100 BTC when you meant 100 USD!</p>
        <p>And then you click or tap &ldquo;<strong>Send</strong>&ldquo;. Congratulations! You&rsquo;ve created a transaction!</p>
        <h3>Step 2: Sign a Transaction</h3>
        <p>After you&rsquo;ve created a transaction, your wallet software will ask you to confirm the transaction and/or ask for your password.</p>
        <p>Clicking &ldquo;<strong>Confirm</strong>&rdquo; or entering your password is what allows your wallet to use your private key to &ldquo;<strong>sign</strong>&rdquo; the transaction.</p>
        <p>Once &ldquo;<strong>signed</strong>&ldquo;, your wallet will broadcast the transaction, along with this &ldquo;digital signature&rdquo;, to the Bitcoin network.</p>
        <p>When you say you are &ldquo;sending bitcoin&rdquo;, what you&rsquo;re actually doing is&nbsp;<strong>sending a (digitally) &ldquo;signed&rdquo; message</strong>&nbsp;to the Bitcoin network authorizing the movement of a specific amount of bitcoin from your wallet address to the seller&rsquo;s wallet address.</p>
        <h3>Step 3: Broadcast a Transaction</h3>
        <p>In order to broadcast a transaction, your wallet will need access to the Bitcoin network.</p>
        <p>A wallet is not a node, it is an&nbsp;<strong>interface</strong>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<em>interacting</em>&nbsp;with a node.</p>
        <p>So your wallet uses the internet to connect to a Bitcoin node and sends your transaction to it. Once the node validates your transaction, it will then broadcast the transaction to other nodes.</p>
        <p>Once a transaction is sent, it will appear as &ldquo;<strong>pending</strong>&ldquo;.</p>
        <p>Your wallet will inform you when your transaction has been &ldquo;<strong>confirmed&rdquo;</strong>.</p>
        <h2>What&rsquo;s a Bitcoin network fee?</h2>
        <p>All Bitcoin transactions must pay a&nbsp;<strong>fee</strong>&nbsp;to be included in the blockchain.</p>
        <p>This fee is known as the&rdquo;<strong>network fee</strong>&rdquo; or &ldquo;<strong>transaction fee</strong>&ldquo;.</p>
        <p>Network fees are fees&nbsp;<strong>paid to the miners</strong>&nbsp;for processing Bitcoin transactions.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Are you wondering, &ldquo;WTF are miners?&rdquo; If you&rsquo;re not familiar with what miners are, I recommend reading my &ldquo;Beginner&rsquo;s Guide to Bitcoin Mining&rdquo;.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Many Bitcoin wallets allow you to customize the Bitcoin network fees you pay when you send bitcoin.</p>
        Transactions with higher fees attached to them are prioritized by miners, so transactions with higher network fees attached are more likely to be included in the next batch, or &rdquo; block&rdquo; of transactions that are added to Bitcoin&rsquo;s blockchain.
        <p>If you&rsquo;re in a rush, you can &ldquo;expedite&rdquo; your transaction processing by paying a higher fee.</p>
        <p>If you&rsquo;re not in a rush to have your transaction confirmed, you can save money by paying a lower fee.&nbsp;<strong>If you set the fee too low though, your transaction may take hours or even days to be confirmed.</strong></p>
        <p>In the worst-case scenario, you&rsquo;ll have to wait 72 hours until the transaction is canceled. But once the transaction is canceled, you&rsquo;ll get your bitcoins back.</p>
        <p>Most wallets select the network fee&nbsp;<strong>automatically</strong>&nbsp;to help you avoid waiting for too long for confirmation of your transaction.</p>
        <p>If you want to ensure that your Bitcoin transactions are confirmed in a timely manner,&nbsp;<strong>use the recommended network fee amount</strong>&nbsp;that your wallet provides.</p>
        <p>A Bitcoin transaction typically takes anywhere from 10 minutes to several hours to be confirmed.</p>
        <h2>How do I know if a Bitcoin transaction is completed?</h2>
        <p>If you&rsquo;d like to know the status of a transaction, you can use something called a &ldquo;<strong>Block Explorer</strong>&ldquo;.</p>
        <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/08/15123105/bitcoin-block-explorer-example-780x585.png" /></p>
        <p>It&rsquo;s an online tool for exploring the blockchain of a cryptocurrency, where you can watch and follow&hellip;live&hellip;all the transactions happening on its blockchain.</p>
        <p>Think of a Block Explorer as a search engine for a blockchain. It allows you to explore current and historical data related to transactions.</p>
        <p>To check the status of an outgoing transaction, all you have to do is enter the recipient&rsquo;s address or transaction ID in the Block Explorer&rsquo;s search field.</p>
        <p>For Bitcoin, examples of popular Block Explorers are Blockchain.com, Block stream Explorer and BlockCypher.</p>
        <p>Most wallets will actually include a link to a Block Explorer in your transaction history. If you click on the transaction link, you&rsquo;ll be able to see your transaction&rsquo;s status on the blockchain.</p>
