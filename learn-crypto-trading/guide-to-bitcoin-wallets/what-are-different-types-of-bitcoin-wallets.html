        <p>There is no such thing as THE Bitcoin wallet.</p>
        <p>There are&nbsp;<em>multiple&nbsp;</em>Bitcoin wallets available that you can use. And they come in different types.</p>
        <p>To make it easier for you to understand, I classify each &ldquo;type&rdquo; of crypto wallet into three groups:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Medium</strong>: What type of medium the wallet is stored on?</li>
        <li><strong>Connectivity</strong>: Is the wallet connected to the internet?</li>
        <li><strong>Custodianship</strong>: Who has access to, and therefore, control of the wallet&rsquo;s private keys?</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Crypto Wallets Based on Medium</h2>
        <p>In terms of&nbsp;<em>medium</em>, wallets can be broken into four main categories:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Software wallets</li>
        <li>Hardware wallets</li>
        <li>Paper wallets</li>
        <li>Brain wallets</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Software wallets</h3>
        <p>A&nbsp;<strong>software wallet</strong>&nbsp;is a computer program or mobile app that holds private keys online.</p>
        <p>They connect to the Bitcoin network through trusted full nodes, centralized services (such as centralized exchanges), or are full nodes themselves.</p>
        <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/08/13141741/crypto-software-wallet-360x212.png" /></p>
        <p>There are three types of&nbsp;<em>software</em>&nbsp;wallets:</p>
        <ol>
        <li><strong>Desktop wallets</strong>&nbsp;that are used on a desktop or laptop computer.</li>
        <li><strong>Mobile wallets</strong>&nbsp;that work as a mobile &ldquo;app&rdquo; and are used on your smartphones</li>
        <li><strong>Web-based wallets</strong>&nbsp;that work as a browser extension and are used in your web browser.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Hardware wallets</h3>
        <p>A&nbsp;<strong>hardware wallet</strong>&nbsp;is a small, portable&nbsp;<em>physical</em>&nbsp;device (similar to a USB flash drive) that keeps your private keys isolated from the internet at all times.</p>
        <p>To transact, a computer and the device manufacturer&rsquo;s software application are required to authorize (or &ldquo;sign&rdquo;) the transaction since the private keys are kept offline.</p>
        <p>Hardware wallets provide an extra layer of security than software wallets but most people don&rsquo;t use them since they&rsquo;re complicated and the devices themselves are expensive.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>I recommend hardware wallets from Ledger, Trezor, or SecuX.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Here&rsquo;s an example of what a hardware wallet looks like:</p>
        <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/08/13141156/ledger-hardware-wallet-269x360.webp"  /></p>
        <h3>Paper wallets</h3>
        <p>A&nbsp;<strong>paper wallet</strong>&nbsp;is literally a piece of paper with your address and private key printed or written on it.</p>
        <p>Paper wallets are created by downloading software, then running the software offline (disconnected from the internet) to generate a public/private key pair which you print out on a piece of paper.</p>
        <p>Here&rsquo;s an example of what a Bitcoin paper wallet looks like:</p>
        <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/08/13132607/bitcoin-paper-wallet-360x116.png"  /></p>
        <h3>Brain wallets</h3>
        <p>A&nbsp;<strong>brain wallet</strong>&nbsp;refers to a private key that is stored in the user&rsquo;s memory in the form of a&nbsp;<strong>seed phrase,</strong>&nbsp;which is a&nbsp;sequence of 12-24 words (often called a &ldquo;mnemonic phrase&rdquo;).</p>
        <p>It is similar to a paper wallet, except nothing is written down on paper. It&rsquo;s all stored in memory&hellip;.<strong>your memory</strong>.</p>
        <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/08/13143015/useless-brain-wallet-360x360.png" /></p>
        <p>If you&rsquo;ve ever forgotten a password, ca brain wallets is definitely NOT for you.</p>
        <p>Here&rsquo;s a beautiful painting of the different wallet types by medium:</p>

        <h2>Crypto&nbsp;Wallets Based on Internet Connectivity</h2>
        <p>In terms of&nbsp;<em>internet connectivity</em>, wallets can be broken into two categories:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Hot wallets</li>
        <li>Cold wallets (or &ldquo;cold storage&rdquo;)</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Hot wallets</h3>
        <p>ðŸ”¥ The &ldquo;<strong>hot</strong>&rdquo; in hot wallet refers to its connection to the interwebz.</p>
        <p>A wallet is considered &ldquo;<strong>hot</strong>&rdquo; when:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>The wallet can be directly accessed through the internet or&hellip;</li>
        <li>The wallet is on a device that is always connected to the internet</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you can access your crypto directly through a web browser or through a desktop, laptop, tablet, or mobile phone that has an internet connection, then in the words of the legendary Paris Hilton, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s hot.&rdquo;</p>
        <div>
        <div>
        <table border="1px">
        <tbody>
        <tr>
        <th>PROS</th>
        <th>CONS</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>You can access it from anywhere with an internet connection</td>
        <td>Your keys are kept on the third-party&rsquo;s servers.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>It&rsquo;s easier to recover access if you lose the private key than cold wallets</td>
        <td>Vulnerable to a wider variety of attacks than cold wallets making it less secure.</td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>
        </table>
        </div>
        </div>
        <h3>Cold wallets</h3>
        <p>ðŸ§Š The &ldquo;<strong>cold</strong>&rdquo; in a cold wallet or cold storage refers to the lack of connection to the internet.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Because cold wallets are never connected to the internet, online theft of your bitcoins is impossible. A hacker would have to&nbsp;<em>physically</em>&nbsp;steal the device to gain access to your bitcoins.</p>
        <div>
        <div>
        <table border="1px">
        <tbody>
        <tr>
        <th>PROS</th>
        <th>CONS</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>More secure than hot wallets due to offline storage of keys.</td>
        <td>If you lose your keys and don&rsquo;t and didn&rsquo;t back them up, recovery is impossible.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>Most popular hardware wallets are supported by hot wallets</td>
        <td>Transactions usually take longer.</td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>
        </table>
        </div>
        </div>
        <p>Here&rsquo;s a diagram showing how the different types of crypto wallets are classified as either a&nbsp;<strong>hot wallet or cold storage</strong>:<br /><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/02/23183627/bitcoin-wallets-types-by-connectivity.png" /></p>
        <h2>Crypto Wallets Based on Custody</h2>
        <p>When it comes to cash, there are two ways to keep it safe:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Do it yourself and assume full responsibility. (Hide it under your mattress or keep it in a safe.)</li>
        <li>Trust someone else to do it for you. (Like a bank.)</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The same thing applies to cryptocurrencies under the concept of &ldquo;<strong>custody</strong>&ldquo;.</p>
        <p>With cryptocurrencies, &ldquo;<strong>custody</strong>&rdquo; refers to the ability of a trusted entity or third party to hold and protect its customers&rsquo;&nbsp;<strong>private keys</strong>&nbsp;and cryptocurrency holdings.</p>
        <p>In terms of custody, Bitcoin wallets can be broken into two categories:</p>
        <ol>
        <li><strong>Custodial wallets:&nbsp;</strong>the wallet provider has access to your bitcoin.</li>
        <li><strong>Non-Custodial wallets:&nbsp;</strong>the wallet provider does NOT have access to your bitcoin.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Custodial Wallets</h3>
        <p>A&nbsp;<strong>custodial wallet</strong>&nbsp;is controlled by a trusted entity, with the user typically having to access its contents via a web interface. These sites store private keys for you so you don&rsquo;t have to worry about them.</p>
        <p>Custodial wallets are also known as &ldquo;<strong>hosted wallets</strong>&ldquo;. Wallets are considered &ldquo;hosted&rdquo; because a third party holds your crypto for you, similar to how a bank holds your money in a savings or checking (or current) account.</p>
        Wallets provided by&nbsp;<strong>centralized crypto exchanges (CEXs)</strong>&nbsp;are a common example of custodial wallets. They hold your bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies in an account, and they manage and control the keys.
        <p>This means that they have full control over your funds.</p>
        <p><strong>You only have permission to send and receive bitcoin.</strong></p>
        <p>There&rsquo;s a popular saying in the crypto world:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;if you don&rsquo;t control your keys, you don&rsquo;t control your coins.&rdquo;</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>If you keep cryptocurrency on an exchange, then&nbsp;<strong>it is the custodian of your private keys</strong>. You&rsquo;re trusting it with your keys in the same way you&rsquo;d trust a bank&rsquo;s vault to hold your cash.</p>
        <p>When using a custodial wallet, there&rsquo;s always a risk that the trusted third-party entity involved could be hacked or you could lose all your crypto.</p>
        <p>Many people like the convenience of using a custodial wallet since they don&rsquo;t have to store their private keys themselves and have to worry about losing them.</p>
        <p>Accessing a custodial wallet usually just requires a password, and even if you lose or forget your password, you can always contact the third-party provider to reset your password.</p>
        <h3>Non-Custodial Wallets</h3>
        <p>A&nbsp;<strong>non-custodial wallet</strong>&nbsp;gives the user full control over their funds and the associated private keys or seed phrase.</p>
        <p>This sounds great but that also means that YOU are solely responsible for the security of your own private keys.</p>
        <p>While non-custodial wallets provide the software necessary to manage your crypto, the responsibility of keeping your private keys safe falls entirely on YOU.</p>
        <p>There is no third party or a &ldquo;custodian&rdquo; to keep your crypto safe.</p>
        <p>If you lose or forget your private key or seed phrase, there&rsquo;s no way to access your crypto. They are not stored on any online server by a trusted third party and are therefore much less susceptible to theft or hacking.</p>
        <p>If you lose them, you will lose access to your funds forever. There will be no entity or third party that you can contact to help you recover your private keys.</p>
        <p>And if someone else discovers your private key, they&rsquo;ll get full access to your crypto.</p>
        <p>That&rsquo;s why when you entrust your bitcoins to nobody and take responsibility for your own funds by saving your private keys yourself, this is known as &ldquo;<strong>self-custody</strong>&ldquo;.</p>
        <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/02/23192304/bitcoin-wallets-types-by-custody.png" /></p>
        <p>&ldquo;<strong>Self-sovereignty</strong>&rdquo; is an important concept in crypto. It means that one should have access to their cryptocurrency without needing to depend on a bank or other trusted third party (TTP) to keep it safe or reveal/prove their identity. Using a non-custodial wallet helps you achieve this.</p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>A Bitcoin wallet is necessary for storing private and public keys, which are used to send and receive transactions.</p>
        <p>Different types of wallets offer varying levels of&nbsp;<strong>security</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>ease of use</strong>.</p>
        <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/02/28114011/bitcoin-wallet-security-vs-ease-of-use.png"  /></p>
        <p>If&nbsp;<strong>security and long-term storag</strong>e is your primary goal, then a&nbsp;<strong>cold wallet</strong>&nbsp;is a better option than a hot wallet.</p>
        <p>An example of a cold wallet is a hardware wallet from Ledger, Trezor, or SecuX.</p>
        <p>If you want to&nbsp;<strong>make frequent and fast transactions</strong>, without being solely responsible for the security of your wallet and seed phrase, a&nbsp;<strong>custodial hot wallet</strong>&nbsp;may be the better option.</p>
