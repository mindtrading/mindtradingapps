        <p>How do you receive bitcoins?</p>
        <p>In the previous lesson, you learned how to send bitcoins,&nbsp;now it&rsquo;s time to learn how to&nbsp;<em>receive</em>&nbsp;them.</p>
        <p>Receiving bitcoin is an even simpler process than sending.</p>
        <p>(Just like receiving selfies is even simpler than sending them.)</p>
        <p><strong>To receive bitcoin, you don&rsquo;t have to do much</strong>. Most of the work is done by the&nbsp;<em>sender</em>.</p>
        <p>It&rsquo;s mostly staring at your screen and waiting to see your Bitcoin wallet balance update.</p>
        <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/08/18074643/receive-bitcoins-waiting-1.png"  /></p>
        <p>All you have to do is to provide ONE thing to the sender:&nbsp;<strong>your Bitcoin address.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>An address is how you&nbsp;<em>receive</em>&nbsp;funds</strong>&nbsp;and acts as a virtual location where the bitcoins can be sent.</p>
        <p>Your&nbsp;<strong>wallet</strong>&nbsp;will generate a Bitcoin address for you. The address can be displayed in two ways:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>An<strong>&nbsp;alphanumeric</strong>&nbsp;string that you can copy/paste.</li>
        <li>A&nbsp;<strong>QR code</strong>&nbsp;which can be scanned by the sender using their smartphone&rsquo;s camera.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Typically, the wallet software will&nbsp;<strong>generate a new address</strong>&nbsp;for every new transaction you create. This makes it more difficult for someone to track your transaction history on the blockchain.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Make sure to double-check the address before giving it to the sender. If the sender sends the transaction and the address is wrong or has a typo, the bitcoins sent will be lost forever.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h2>How do I know what my Bitcoin address is?</h2>
        <p>To find out your Bitcoin address, you just have to access your Bitcoin wallet.</p>
        <p>While every Bitcoin wallet is a little different, your Bitcoin address will usually be clearly displayed and easily found.</p>
        A Bitcoin address consists of between&nbsp;<strong>26 and 35 alphanumeric characters</strong>.
        <p>Here are some examples to give you an idea of what they look like:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>1FeexV6bAHb8ybZjqQMjJrcCrHGW9sb6uF</li>
        <li>34xp4vRoCGJym3xR7yCVPFHoCNxv4Twseo</li>
        <li>bc1qa5wkgaew2dkv56kfvj49j0av5nml45x9ek9hz6</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>How do I share my Bitcoin address?</h2>
        <p>To make sharing your address easy, most Bitcoin wallets allow you to&nbsp;<strong>copy and paste</strong>&nbsp;your Bitcoin address.</p>
        <p>You can paste the address into a message and send it via&nbsp;<strong>text message or email</strong>.</p>
        <p>Most wallets will also provide you with a&nbsp;<strong>QR code</strong>, which is just a graphical representation of the Bitcoin address.</p>
        <p>If you&rsquo;re physically in front of the sender, he or she can scan your QR code to get your address.</p>
        <p>Here&rsquo;s an example of a Bitcoin address in a QR code format:</p>
        <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/03/29143756/bitcoin-public-address-QR-code-150x150.png"  /></p>
        <h2>Is it safe to publicly share my Bitcoin address?</h2>
        <p>You can safely share your Bitcoin address with friends, family, and frenemies.</p>
        No one can steal your bitcoin using just your Bitcoin address. In order to do that, they&rsquo;d need your seed phrase (or private key).
        <p>Even though your bitcoins can&rsquo;t be stolen just by knowing your address, since Bitcoin&rsquo;s blockchain is&nbsp;<em>publicly viewable</em>, anyone who knows your Bitcoin address can easily find out exactly&nbsp;<strong>how many bitcoins you have at that address</strong>&nbsp;by simply looking up your address in a Block Explorer.</p>
        <p>With a Block Explorer, anyone can see&nbsp;<strong><em>every</em>&nbsp;transaction that has occurred&nbsp;</strong>at an address.</p>
        <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/08/21100610/satoshi-address.png" /></p>
        <p>If you don&rsquo;t want people to see this information, you&rsquo;ll need to use a brand new Bitcoin address&nbsp;<strong>for every transaction</strong>.</p>
        <p>Fortunately, most Bitcoin wallets now allow you to create an almost unlimited number of new addresses with just a click or tap of a button.</p>
        <p>For Bitcoin, examples of popular Block Explorers are Blockchain.com, Block stream Explorer and BlockCypher.</p>
