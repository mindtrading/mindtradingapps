    <p>What is Bitcoin?</p>
    <p>While there are many different ways to answer this question, now that you&rsquo;ve gone through the previous lessons, you can now answer with confidence!</p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s now take all the concepts you&rsquo;ve learned and put them all together.</p>
    <p><strong>Bitcoin</strong>&nbsp;(uppercase &ldquo;B&rdquo;) is a new SYSTEM that manages the creation and ownership of digital &ldquo;money&rdquo; that exist independently from any government, central bank, or other central institution.</p>
    <p>This &ldquo;money&rdquo; is denominated in&nbsp;<strong>bitcoins</strong>&nbsp;(lowercase &ldquo;b&rdquo;).</p>
    <p>The Bitcoin system is a fully<strong>&nbsp;autonomous system</strong>&nbsp;that&rsquo;s basically just a bunch of computers, called&nbsp;<strong>nodes</strong>, that &ldquo;talk&rdquo; to each other over the internet.</p>
    <p>To be able to talk to each other, Bitcoin&nbsp;<strong>software</strong>&nbsp;is installed on each computer.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/02/17162517/bitcoin-software-code-360x360.png" /></p>
    <p>Anybody can download and install this software.</p>
    <p>The Bitcoin software is&nbsp;<strong>open source</strong>&nbsp;which means anybody can look at the source code.</p>
    <p>If the computer is connected to the internet and starts running the software, it becomes a Bitcoin&nbsp;<strong>node</strong>.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/03/04104707/bitcoin-node.png" /></p>
    <p>And when there are two or more Bitcoin&nbsp;<strong>nodes</strong>&nbsp;online, this creates the&nbsp;<strong>Bitcoin network</strong>!</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/03/04104809/Bitcoin-network-341x360.png" /></p>
    <p>The Bitcoin network is a peer-to-peer (P2P) network that runs 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and 365 days a year. (Like your typical 7-Eleven.)</p>
    <p>In this network, communication between computers (nodes) is done without any central administration or server, which means all nodes have equal power and perform the same tasks.</p>
    <p>It is also a<strong>&nbsp;permissionless</strong>&nbsp;network. Meaning you don&rsquo;t need permission to be part of the network. Anybody can join. Or leave.</p>
    <p>The software autonomously runs the Bitcoin&nbsp;<strong>protocol</strong>. It runs on autopilot.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/03/04104904/Bitcoin-protocol.png" /></p>
    <p>A&nbsp;<strong>protocol</strong>&nbsp;is just a&nbsp;fancy word used in the computer software world that describes a&nbsp;set of&nbsp;programming instructions or &ldquo;rules&rdquo; that allow computers to communicate and interact with each other.</p>
    <p>Think of protocols as standardized rules that determine what a system should or should not do.</p>
    <p>The Bitcoin protocol is run over the Bitcoin network and provides these computers with the&nbsp;<strong>operating instructions</strong>&nbsp;and information they need to keep track of and verify transactions occurring on the network.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>It lays out the steps that computers in the network must perform to&nbsp;<em>reach a consensus</em>&nbsp;on the validity of each transaction.</p>
    <p>Because the Bitcoin network is decentralized, meaning there is no central authority to &ldquo;obey&rdquo;, another&nbsp;<strong>&ldquo;decision-making&rdquo; method</strong>&nbsp;is needed for all these computers to come to an agreement on which transactions are actually valid.</p>
    <p>It is the Bitcoin protocol, run as a software application, that&rsquo;s installed on every computer (&ldquo;node&rdquo;) in the Bitcoin network is what allows independent members of the network to&nbsp;<strong>coordinate</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>function collectively as the Bitcoin system</strong>.</p>
    <p>The Bitcoin protocol establishes how the Bitcoin network OPERATES as a system.</p>
    <p>In addition to running the Bitcoin protocol, every node stores a&nbsp;<strong>data file</strong>&nbsp;that carries the records of ALL transactions ever made on the Bitcoin network, including the creation of new bitcoins.</p>
    <p>This file is called the&nbsp;<strong>blockchain</strong>.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/03/04110902/blockchain-as-a-file-150x150.png" /></p>
    <p>How the data is&nbsp;<strong>structured</strong>&nbsp;when they are recorded or &ldquo;saved&rdquo; to the file is what makes the blockchain different from other record-keeping methods like traditional databases or spreadsheets.</p>
    <p>Bitcoin&rsquo;s blockchain consists of a sequence of blocks where each block builds on the previous block&hellip;.creating a &ldquo;<strong>chain of blocks</strong>&rdquo; or &ldquo;<strong>blockchain</strong>&rdquo;.</p>
    <p>Inside each&nbsp;<strong>block</strong>&nbsp;is information about transactions.</p>
    <p>More specifically, the blockchain holds &ldquo;<strong>archived</strong>&rdquo; or&nbsp;<strong>confirmed</strong>&nbsp;transactions, which are packaged in &ldquo;<strong>blocks</strong>&ldquo;.</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/03/04110140/block-150x150.png" /></p>
    <p>The average time between blocks being saved to the data file (blockchain) is&nbsp;<strong>10 minutes.</strong></p>
    <p>So think of the blockchain as a continuously growing database of permanent records, that are stored in &ldquo;blocks&rdquo; that are linked and secured using cryptography.</p>
    <p><strong>There is no single instance of the blockchain.</strong></p>
    <p>Each node gets an &ldquo;official&rdquo; copy of Bitcoin&rsquo;s blockchain, which gets downloaded automatically when it voluntarily joins Bitcoin&rsquo;s network.</p>
    <p>Every node on the network acts as an&nbsp;<strong>&ldquo;administrator&rdquo; of its own version of blockchain</strong>&nbsp;(the data file). Each node does not trust each other so they&rsquo;re constantly&nbsp;<strong>re-verifying</strong>&nbsp;the data that are shared with each other and making sure all Bitcoin transactions are valid.</p>
    <p>These computers are also constantly asking each other,&nbsp;<strong>&ldquo;Are our blockchains the same?&rdquo;</strong></p>
    <p>And in the cases of disagreement, where some nodes have different ledgers, all nodes need to figure out,&nbsp;<strong>&ldquo;Whose version of the blockchain is correct?&rdquo;</strong></p>
    <p>Because every node in the Bitcoin network is acting&nbsp;<strong>independently</strong>&nbsp;when validating transactions and maintaining their version of the blockchain, there must be a non-disputable agreement in which version of the blockchain is the &ldquo;real&rdquo; blockchain among all the nodes.</p>
    <p>A&nbsp;<strong>single history of transactions</strong>&nbsp;needs to be maintained. This requires some sort of method that everyone on the network agrees will adhere to.</p>
    <p>That method is by&nbsp;<strong>consensus</strong>.</p>
    <p>The process of achieving consensus among the nodes is called the *c<strong>onsensus mechanism</strong>*.</p>
    <p>For Bitcoin, a consensus is achieved through a process called &ldquo;<strong>mining&rdquo;</strong>.</p>
    <p>Mining is the process of&nbsp;<strong>confirming transactions</strong>&nbsp;and adding them to the blockchain.</p>
    <p>Specialist nodes who participate in mining are known as&nbsp;<strong>miners</strong>&nbsp;and form a critical part of the Bitcoin network.</p>
    <p>In simple terms, miners bundle together valid transactions into a&nbsp;<strong>block</strong>&nbsp;and then compete to be the first to guess a number that starts with a certain number of zeros. So the actual &ldquo;mining&rdquo; can be described as &ldquo;guessing&rdquo;.</p>
    <p>Or even more accurate, &ldquo;guessing fast AF&rdquo;.</p>
    <p>And since miners want to guess as fast as possible, which requires using specialized computer hardware that uses up a lot of electricity, this process is expensive.</p>
    <p>To&nbsp;<strong>incentivize</strong>&nbsp;nodes to participate as miners, they earn&nbsp;<strong>transaction fees</strong>&nbsp;paid in bitcoin and also are rewarded with&nbsp;<strong>new bitcoins</strong>&nbsp;(&ldquo;block subsidy&rdquo;)</p>
    <p>The&nbsp;<strong>first miner</strong>&nbsp;to guess the correct number shares the newly &ldquo;mined&rdquo; block with the Bitcoin network. Other nodes verify that the guessed number is correct, and if it is, then everyone else updates their blockchain with the new block as well.</p>
    <p>Mining allows the entire Bitcoin network to AGREE on which transactions get &ldquo;archived&rdquo; and added to the blockchain.</p>
    <p>As you can see, there&rsquo;s a lot of stuff going on in the Bitcoin system</p>
    <p>What&rsquo;s neat is that ALL of this is being done automatically by computers! And all of it happening in&nbsp;<strong>public view</strong>!</p>
    <p>Since the blockchain keeps track of every change in ownership of every single bitcoin, the public can see that someone is sending an amount to someone else.</p>
    <p>And since the ownership of bitcoins is tied to&nbsp;<strong>addresses,&nbsp;</strong>this information&nbsp;<strong>does NOT directly link the transaction to information that personally identifies the sender or the receiver</strong>.</p>
    <p>This level of transparency, where anyone can monitor the &ldquo;movement&rdquo; of bitcoins to different&nbsp;<strong>addresses</strong>, is something you won&rsquo;t find with traditional financial institutions.</p>
    <p>It would be akin to your bank giving you (and all its customers) access to its ledger and allowing you to see, in real-time, whenever funds were moved&nbsp;<strong>from one account number to another account number</strong>&nbsp;along with the exact amount. 😲</p>
    <p>Congratulations! We have finally finished our simplified &ldquo;map&rdquo; of the overall Bitcoin system.</p>

    <p>If you understand everything that&rsquo;s mentioned on the map, find the nearest person to you and scream:</p>
    <p><strong>&ldquo;I NOW UNDERSTAND BITCOIN YO!&rdquo;</strong></p>
    <p>And then give them a big fat high five!</p>
    <p><img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2022/08/15173211/high-five-360x360.png" /></p>
    <p>If there&rsquo;s nobody around you though, you can still go up to a mirror and tell yourself:</p>
    <p><strong>&ldquo;YOU NOW UNDERSTAND BITCOIN YO!&rdquo;</strong></p>
    <p>And high-five yourself.</p>
