         <h3>Description and use</h3>
         <img src="img/43.webp"/>
         <p>Short Iron Butterfly is the opposite of Long Iron Butterfly strategy. Despite the net debit, it is not popular, because its return is smaller than a Straddle’s or a Strangle’s return. It is the combination of the Bull Put Spread and the Bear Call Spread. The strike of the higher Put equals to the strike of the lower Call. This makes the options form a butterfly shape. The investor can profit from shares with large price fluctuations. The disadvantage of this strategy is the limited profit and the maximum loss when share prices are moving in a range. The direction of the market is neutral. The investor speculates on shares with high volatility. This strategy is relatively cheap and has a limited return. The investor believes that the underlying shares have high volatility. The expiration should be at least three months. The position should be closed one month before expiry.
