         <h3>Description and use</h3>
         <img src="img/34.webp"/>
         <p>Short Call Butterfly is the opposite of Long Call Butterfly strategy. Despite the net credit nature of the investment, it is not popular, because its return is smaller than a Straddle’s or a Strangle’s return. To establish the position, the trader has to sell a lower strike Short Call, buy two middle ATM Long Calls, and sell a higher strike OTM Short Call. The investor can profit from shares with large price fluctuations. The profit is limited, and stable share prices will increase the risk. The direction of the market is neutral. The investor should look for shares with high volatility. The profit is maximised when the share closes at one of the strike prices of the Short Calls. The expiration should be at least three months.

         <ul>
             <li>Sell a lower strike (ITM) Call option.</li>
             <li>Buy two middle (ATM) Call options.</li>
             <li>Sell a higher strike (OTM) Call option.</li>
         </ul>
         <p>All options must have the same expiration. The difference of consecutive options’ strike prices must be equal. The risk is maximized if the share price is around the middle components’ strike price at expiry.</p>
