         <h3>Description and use</h3>
         <img src="img/61.webp"/>
         <p>Long Straddle option is a popular strategy. To establish the position, the trader has to buy a Long Put and a Long Call with same strike prices and expiration. The investment will be profitable whether the share prices are falling or increasing. The investment has unlimited profit and limited risk. Profit is generated when the movement of the share prices covers the premiums paid. The optimal duration is three months. Time decay has a negative effect on the value, especially during the last month before expiration. The underlying share should show pennant or flag shapes on charts. The volatility of the share should be strongly decreasing. The direction of the market is neutral. Ideally, the expected implied volatility is low. The strategy is a net debit investment. The maximum profit is potentially unlimited and the maximum loss is limited.</p>
