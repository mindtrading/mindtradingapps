         <h3>Description and use</h3>
         <img src="img/31.webp"/>
         <p>Modified Put Butterfly is similar to Long Put Butterfly, but the difference between the strike of the middle Call and the higher Long Call is smaller than the difference between the strike of the lower Call and the other middle Call. This strategy is very similar to the Modified Call Butterfly. The profit is maximised when the share price closes close to the middle components’ strike price. This strategy requires the investor to pay close attention to details. To establish the position, the trader needs to have a lower strike Long Put, two middle ATM Short Puts, and higher strike OTM Long Put in the portfolio. The investor can profit from increasing share prices or the share prices moving within given limits. Despite the attractive risk/profit ratio, the maximum profit is limited. The direction of the market is neutral or moderately increasing. The expected profit is relatively high, given the low costs. The duration of the investment is one month or less.
