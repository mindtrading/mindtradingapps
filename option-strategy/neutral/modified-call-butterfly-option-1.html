         <h3>Description and use</h3>
         <img src="img/28.webp"/>
         <p>Modified Call Butterfly is similar to Long Call Butterfly, but the difference between the strike of the middle Call and the higher Long Call is smaller than the difference between the strike of the lower Call and the other middle Call. Consequently, the profit is maximised when the share price closes close to the middle components’ strike price. This strategy requires the investor to pay close attention to details. To establish the position, the trader must buy a lower strike ITM Long Call, sell two middle ATM Short Calls, and buy a higher strike OTM Long Call. The investor can profit from increasing share prices or the share prices moving within given limits. Despite the attractive risk/profit ratio, the maximum profit is limited. The direction of the market is neutral or moderately increasing. The expected profit is relatively high, given the low costs. The expiration should be at least three months.
