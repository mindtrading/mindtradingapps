         <h3>Description and use</h3>
         <img src="img/25.webp"/>
         <p>Long Put Condor option is the opposite of Short Put Condor. This strategy is popular, even though it is a net debit investment. The popularity is from the attractive risk/profit ratio. The longed options at the two sides guarantee limited risk. To establish the position, the trader must buy a lower strike OTM Long Put, in the middle there must be a lower strike OTM Short Put and a higher strike ITM Short Put, and finally, the trader must buy a higher strike ITM Long Put option. The investor can profit from share prices moving within given limits. The risk/profit ratio and the profit range is wider than for Long Butterfly Strategy. The direction of the market is neutral. The investor speculates on shares with low volatility and small price changes. The expected profit is relatively high, given the low costs. The expiration should be at least three months.
