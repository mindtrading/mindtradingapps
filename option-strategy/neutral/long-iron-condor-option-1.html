         <h3>Description and use</h3>
         <img src="img/19.webp"/>
         <p>Long Iron Condor option strategy can be profitable if the underlying’s price increases or moves within given levels. It is basically a combination of a Bull Put Spread and a Bear Call Spread, but it can be also seen as a version of a Long Iron Butterfly. The strike of the higher Put is lower than the strike of the lower Call. This makes the options form a condor shape. The combination of two income strategies result another income strategy. Ideally, the share price closes between the middle components strike prices, which maximises the profit. In this case the options can expire and the investor can keep the combined credit. The range of the breakeven points are wider due to the Bull Put - Bear Call combination. The direction of the market is neutral. The investor speculates on shares with low volatility and small price changes. The strategy is a net credit investment. It is a short-term investment, usually one month or less.</p>
