         <img src="img/55.webp"/>
         <p>Short Straddle is the opposite of Long Straddle strategy. Short-term (one month or less) ATM Put and Call options are sold to enhance the profitability of the portfolio. This is duration is highly recommended, because of the potential unlimited risk. Both components have unlimited risk. When shares are fluctuating in both directions, the position is highly uncertain. The investor can profit from share prices moving within given limits. The direction of the market is neutral. The trader speculates on sideway market moves. The volatility is expected to decrease in the future. However, higher implied volatility is ideal. The duration of the strategy should be one month or less.</p>
