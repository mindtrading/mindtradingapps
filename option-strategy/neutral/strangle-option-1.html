         <h3>Description and use</h3>
         <img src="img/64.webp"/>
         <p>Long Strangle is a version of Long Straddle strategy, but the investment is cheaper when OTM options are purchased instead of ATM options. Due to the lower costs, higher return is expected. The two breakeven points are farther from each other in this strategy. To establish the position, the trader has to buy a lower strike Long Put and a higher strike Long Call. The investment will be profitable whether the share prices are falling or increasing. Time decay has a negative effect on the value. The direction of the market is neutral. The trader speculates on fluctuating volatility. Ideally, the implied volatility is low. The strategy is a net debit investment. The maximum risk is limited, cannot be more than the net debit. The maximum profit is potentially unlimited. The optimal maturity is three months.</p>
