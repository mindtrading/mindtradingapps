         <h3>Description and use</h3>
         <img src="img/10.webp"/>
         <p>Long Call Butterfly is the opposite of Short Call Butterfly strategy. This strategy is popular, even though it is a net debit investment. The popularity is from the attractive risk/profit ratio. To establish the position, the trader has to buy a lower strike Long Call, sell two middle ATM Short Calls, and buy a higher strike OTM Long Call. The Long Puts guarantee the limited risk. The investor can profit from increasing share prices or the share prices moving within given limits. Despite the attractive risk/profit ratio, the maximum profit is limited. The direction of the market is neutral. The investor speculates on shares with low volatility and small price changes. The expected profit is relatively high, given the low costs. The expiration should be at least three months.
