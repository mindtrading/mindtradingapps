         <h3>Description and use</h3>
         <img src="img/49.webp"/>
         <p>Short Put Butterfly is similar to Short Call Butterfly, but instead of Call positions, the strategy consists of Put options. Short Put Butterfly is the opposite of Long Put Butterfly strategy. Despite the net credit, it is not popular, because its return is smaller than a Straddle’s or a Strangle’s return. To establish the position, the trader needs to have a lower strike Short Put, two middle ATM Long Puts, and a higher strike ITM Short Put in the portfolio. The investor can profit from shares with large price fluctuations. The disadvantage of this strategy is the limited profit and the maximum loss when share prices are moving in a range. The direction of the market is neutral. The investor speculates on shares with high volatility. The potential profit has an upper limit. The expiration should be at least three months.</p>
