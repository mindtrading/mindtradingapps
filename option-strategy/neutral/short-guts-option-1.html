         <h3>Description and use</h3>
         <img src="img/40.webp"/>
         <p>Short Guts option is a version of Short Strangle, but instead of selling OTM options, ITM Call and Put options are sold. The strategy is characterised by unlimited risk on both sides. Short Guts is the opposite of Long Guts strategy. Short-term (one month or less) ITM Put and Call options are sold to enhance the profitability of the portfolio. The direction of the market is neutral. The investor speculates on sideways shares. The volatility is expected to decrease in the future. However, higher implied volatility is required to open the position. The duration of the strategy should be one month or less. This duration is highly recommended, because of the potential unlimited risk.</p>
