         <h3>Description and use</h3>
         <img src="img/46.webp"/>
         <p>Short Iron Condor option is the opposite of Long Iron Condor. The strategy is a net debit investment. Condors in the Short Iron Condor option are almost similar to the shorted butterflies (Short Iron Butterfly), but the two middle components have different strike prices. Despite the net debit investment, it is not popular, because its return is smaller than a Straddle’s or a Strangle’s return. It is the combination of the Bull Put Spread and the Bear Call Spread. The strike of the higher Put is lower than the strike of the lower Call. This makes the options form a condor shape. The investor can profit from shares with large price fluctuations. The disadvantage of this strategy is the limited profit and the maximum loss when share prices are stagnating. The direction of the market is neutral. The investor speculates on shares with high volatility. This strategy is relatively cheap and has a limited return. The investor believes that the underlying shares have high volatility. The expiration should be at least three months. The position should be closed one month before expiry.
