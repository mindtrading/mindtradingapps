         <h3>Description and use</h3>
         <img src="img/13.webp"/>
         <p>Condors in the Long Call Condor option are almost similar to the longed butterflies, but the two middle components have different strike prices. It is the opposite of the Short Call Condor strategy. This strategy is popular, even though it is a net debit investment. The popularity is from the attractive risk/profit ratio. To establish the position, the trader must buy a lower strike ITM Long Call, in the middle there must be a lower strike ITM Short Call and a higher strike OTM Short Call, and finally, the trader must buy a higher strike OTM Long Call option. The investor can profit from share prices moving within given limits. The risk/profit ratio and the profit range is wider than for Long Butterfly Strategy. The direction of the market is neutral. The investor speculates on shares with low volatility and small price changes. The expected profit is relatively high, given the low costs. The expiration should be at least three months.
