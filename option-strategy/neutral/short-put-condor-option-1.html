         <img src="img/52.webp"/>
         <p>Short Put Condor is similar to Short Call Condor, but it consists of Put options instead of Call options. Short Put Condor option is the opposite of Long Put Condor. Despite the net credit investment, it is not popular, because its return is smaller than a Straddle’s or a Strangle’s return. To establish the position, the trader has to sell a lower strike Short Put, in the middle there have to be a lowerer strike OTM Long Put and a higherer strike ITM Long Put, and finally, the trader has to sell a higher strike ITM Short Put option. The investor can profit from shares with large price fluctuations. The disadvantage of this strategy is the limited profit and the maximum loss when share prices are stagnating. The direction of the market is neutral. The investor speculates on shares with high volatility. The potential profit has an upper limit. The expiration should be at least three months.</p>
