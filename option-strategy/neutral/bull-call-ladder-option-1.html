         <h3>Description and use</h3>
         <img src="img/4.webp"/>
         <p>A Bull Call Ladder is a version of Bear Call Spread, but there is an extra Short Call involved with a higher strike price. This way the position is unlimited when share prices are rapidly increasing. It is a spread strategy, because it consists of a Long and a Short position. It is also a vertical strategy, because the bought and sold options have different strike prices. The investor speculates on neutral or increasing market prices. This strategy should be used when the trader is not totally sure about the direction of the market. The strategy is a net debit investment. It is also a neutral strategy, because it is not clear whether it is increasing or decreasing. The direction of the market is determined by the function of the share price and the first strike price. The investor expects the share price to close between the middle and the higher strike price. It is ideal anywhere within that range. Short-term options should be traded, because the increasing share prices result an unlimited risk. When the share price is below the lower strike price, the position will generate losses. When the share price is between the middle and the higher strike prices, the position will generate profit. However, when the share price is above the higher strike price, the position will generate (unlimited) losses again. Because of the extra component, there are both lower and Upper breakeven points.
