         <h3>Description and use</h3>
         <img src="img/22.webp"/>
         <P>Long Put Butterfly is the opposite of Short Put Butterfly strategy. This strategy is popular, even though it is a net debit investment. The popularity is from the attractive risk/profit ratio. To establish the position, the trader needs to have a lower strike Long Put, two middle ATM Short Puts, and higher strike ITM Long Put in the portfolio. The investor can profit from share prices moving within given limits. Despite the attractive risk/profit ratio, the maximum profit is limited. The direction of the market is neutral. The investor speculates on shares with low volatility and small price changes. The expected profit is relatively high, given the low costs. The expiration should be at least three months.
