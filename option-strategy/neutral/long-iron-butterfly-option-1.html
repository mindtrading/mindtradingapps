         <img src="img/16.webp"/>
         <p>Long Iron Butterfly option strategy can be profitable if the underlying’s price increases or moves within given levels. It is the combination of the Bull Put Spread and the Bear Call Spread. The combination of two income strategies result another income strategy. The middle Put option’s strike equals to the middle Call option’s strike price. This gives the butterfly shape. Ideally, the share price closes between the middle components’ strike prices, which maximises the profit. The direction of the market is neutral. The investor speculates on shares with low volatility and small price changes. The strategy is a net credit investment. It is a short-term investment, usually one month or less.</p>
