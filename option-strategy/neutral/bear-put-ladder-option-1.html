         <h3>Description and use</h3>
         <img src="img/1.webp"/>
         <p>Bear Put Ladder is a version of Bear Put Spread, but there is an extra Short Put involved with a lower strike price. Consequently, falling share prices can result a potential unlimited risk. When the share price (Long) is above higher strike price, the position will be potentially lossmaking. The profit is maximised when the share price is between the lower Short Put and the middle component’s strike prices. Because of the extra component, there are both lower and Upper breakeven points. The direction of the market is neutral. The strategy is a net debit investment. It is a short-term investment to avoid the possibility of unlimited losses when share prices fall.</p>
