         <h3>Description and use</h3>
         <img src="img/58.webp"/>
         <p>Short Strangle is a version of the Short Straddle strategy. The difference is the wider range of breakeven points, which increases the probability of the profitability. Instead of selling ATM options, OTM Call and Put options are sold to enhance profitability. Short Strangle is the opposite of Long Strangle strategy. Both components have unlimited risk. When shares are fluctuating in both directions, the position is highly uncertain. When shares are moving within a given range, the profits are limited. The direction of the market is neutral. The trader speculates on sideway prices movements. The volatility is expected to decrease in the future. However, higher implied volatility is ideal. The duration of the strategy should be one month or less. This is duration is highly recommended, because of the potential unlimited risk.</p>
