         <h3>Description and use</h3>
         <img src="img/1.webp"/>
         <p>Bear Call Ladder is a version of Bear Call Spread, but there is an extra Short Call involved with a higher strike price. Consequently, increasing share prices can result a potential unlimited profit. When the share price is above long strike price, the position will be potentially unlimited profitmaking. The profit is maximised when the share price is under the lower and the middle strike prices. Because of the extra component, there are both lower and Upper breakeven points. The direction of the market is increasing. The result of the investment is the function of the share price and the lowest component’s value. The strategy is a net credit investment, because more Call options are bought than sold. This makes the risks limited. The investment is medium- or long-term. Then, there will be enough time for the underlying to move the profitable direction and the time not to have a negative effect on the Long option.</p>
