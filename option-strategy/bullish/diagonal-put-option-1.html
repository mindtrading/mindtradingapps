         <h3>Description and use</h3>
         <img src="img/35.webp"/>
         <p>Diagonal Put is like Diagonal Call but the Call options are replaced by Put options. Therefore, the investments may look similar. The only question is whether trading Calls or Puts result bigger return. The purchased Long Put should be long term and OTM, and the Short Put should be short term and ITM. If the share price increases above the Short Put’s strike price, then the option expires worthless and the Long Put’s value will decrease also. The direction of the market is increasing. It is a safe investment if the Long Put’s expiration is far (back) and the Short Put’s expiration is close (front), usually monthly.</p>
