         <h3>Description and use</h3>
         <img src="img/10.webp"/>
         <p>A Calendar Call option is a horizontal spread strategy. The two options’ expiration is different and their strike prices are the same. Calendar Call is almost like Covered Call position, but the shares are replaced with a long-duration Long Call option. This step decreases the costs and increases the initial return. Because of the identical strike prices, if the share price rises above the strike price, the Short Call option will be exercised. Then the investor should sell the Long Call option, buy shares for the current market price and then sell them for the strike price. Then another option can be sold the next month. The direction of the market is mixed, neutral/increasing. The investor expects constant increase on the market. The investment is characterised by net debit, because the purchased Call options cost more than the sold Call options. It is a safe investment if the Long Call’s expiration is far (back) and the Short Call’s expiration is close (front), usually one month.</p>
