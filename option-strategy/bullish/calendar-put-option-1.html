         <h3>Description and use</h3>
         <img src="img/13.webp"/>
         <p>A Calendar Put option is a horizontal spread strategy. The two options’ expiration is different and their strike prices are the same. Calendar Put is like Calendar Call but the Call options are replaced by Put options. Therefore, the investments may look similar. The only question is whether trading Calls or Puts result bigger return. The direction of the market is mixed, neutral/increasing. The investor expects constant increase on the market. The investment is characterised by net debit, because the purchased Put options cost more than the sold Put options. It is a safe investment if the Long Put’s expiration is far (back) and the Short Put’s expiration is close (front), usually one month.</p>

         <p>Calendar Put Option Positions</p>
         <ul>
             <li>Buy a long term Long Put option.</li>
             <li>Sell a short term Short Put option (same strike price as the Long Put’s).</li>
         </ul>
     
         <h2>Steps</h2>
         <h3>Entry:</h3>
         <p>Make sure the trend is ascending or stagnating at a certain level.</p>
         <h3>Exit:</h3>
         <ul>
             <li>When the share closes below the strike price, the Short Put will be exercised automatically. The investor then sells the Long Put option, buys shares on the market, and then resells them on the market again.</li>
             <li>If the share price is above the strike price but above the lower Stop Loss at expiration, then the Short Put option should be left to expire worthless and the received premium should be kept.</li>
             <li>If the share price is above the upper Stop Loss at expiration then the Long Put option should be sold or the trader should start trading in opposite position.</li>
         </ul>
     
         <h2>Basic Characteristics</h2>
         <ul>
             <li>Maximum loss: Strike price (Put) - Long Put’s maximum value (at first expiration) + net debit.</li>
             <li>Maximum profit: Long Put’s maximum value (at first expiration) - net debit.</li>
             <li>Time decay: Time decay has a mixed effect on the value.</li>
             <li>Lower Breakeven point: At expiry of Short Put, it is the function of the Long Put’s value.</li>
             <li>Upper Breakeven point: At expiry of Short Put, it is the function of the Long Put’s value.</li>
         </ul>
