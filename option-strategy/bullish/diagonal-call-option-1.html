         <h3>Description and use</h3>
         <img src="img/32.webp"/>
         <p>Diagonal Call is almost like Covered Call position, but the shares are replaced with a long-duration ITM Long Call option. With this step, the costs are significantly lower. The position shorted should be short-term and OTM. The profit is maximized when the shares are sold on the strike price of the shorted Call option at expiration. The direction of the market is increasing. The investment is characterised by net debit, because the purchased Call options cost more than the sold Call options. It is a safe investment if the Long Call’s expiration is far (back) and the Short Call’s expiration is close (front), usually monthly.</p>
