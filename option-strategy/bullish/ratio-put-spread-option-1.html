         <h3>Description and use</h3>
         <img src="img/43.webp"/>
         <p>Ratio Put Spread strategy is the opposite of Put Ratio Backspread. The difference is that in this strategy, the Short Puts have lower strikes. Consequently, loss is going to be unlimited and profit is going to be limited. Because of the unlimited risk, increasing volatility is harmful for the position. This strategy is not recommended. Stagnating share prices make the situation better. The strategy consists of Short and Long Put options with the same expiration, but different quantities. Typically, the ratio of the sold/purchased Put options is 2:1 or 3:2. The potential loss is unlimited. The direction of the market is neutral/decreasing. The trader speculates on low volatility shares with stagnating prices. The profit is maximised when the share closes at the lower breakeven point. The investment should be short-term, maximum one month.</p>

    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Price of the underlying (share price): S= $27.65</li>
        <li>Premium (Short Puts): SP= $0.42</li>
        <li>Premium (Long Put): LP= $1.33</li>
        <li>Strike price (Short Puts): KS= $25.00</li>
        <li>Strike price (Long Put): KL= $27.50</li>
        <li>Net debit: ND</li>
        <li>Maximum loss: R</li>
        <li>Maximum profit: Pr</li>
        <li>Lower breakeven point: LBEP</li>
        <li>Upper breakeven point: UBEP</li>
        <li>Quantity (Long Put): nL= 1</li>
        <li>Quantity (Short Puts): nS= 2</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Net debit: ND = LP - 2 * SP</li>
        <li>Maximum loss (risk): R = KL - nS * (KL - KS) + ND</li>
        <li>Maximum profit: Pr = nL * (KL - KS) - ND</li>
        <li>Lower breakeven point: LBEP = KL - nS * (KL - KS) + ND</li>
        <li>Upper breakeven point: UBEP = KL - nL * ND</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>ND = $0.49</li>
        <li>R = $22.99</li>
