         <h3>Description and use</h3>
         <img src="img/29.webp"/>
         <p>A Covered Short Strangle is a risky strategy and it is a version of the Covered Short Straddle. The main idea is to sell a lower strike OTM Put option to increase the return of a Covered Call. When the share price is below the Short Put’s strike price, the risk increases. The Short Put option increases the risk of the overall strategy. The extra risk equals the difference of the Short Put’s strike price and its premium. When the share price is below the Short Put’s strike price, the Short Put will be exercised and the Short Call will expire worthless. Consequently, further shares must be purchased at the Short Put’s strike price. This situation is expensive when the share prices fall. When the share prices are below the Short Call’s strike price, the Short Put will expire worthless, the Short Call will be exercised, and the shares are going to be delivered. The direction of the market is increasing. The goal of the strategy is to increase monthly revenues. Usually the trading takes place on a monthly basis.</p>

        <h3>Exit:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>When the share price is above the strike price, the Short Call will be exercised automatically and the investor will deliver the shares. The income equals to the received premiums.</li>
            <li>When the share price is at or below the strike price, the Short Put will be exercised. Then further shares must be purchased. The investor must pay the strike price for the shares. Therefore, it is an expensive transaction.</li>
            <li>When the share price is between the two strikes, the investor can keep the premiums. Covered Short Strangle is a risky strategy and not recommended for beginners.</li>
        </ul>
