         <p>Put Ratio Backspread strategy is the opposite of Call Ratio Backspread. Put Ratio Backspread generates profit when share prices are rapidly decreasing. Furthermore, increased volatility is useful for the position. sideway prices are unbeneficial for the strategy. The strategy consists of Short and Long Put options with same the expiration, but different quantities. Typically, the ratio of the purchased/sold Put options is 2:1 or 3:2. Thus, it is a net credit investment. The potential profit is unlimited. The direction of the market is (aggressively) decreasing. The trader speculates on high volatility shares with explosively decreasing prices. The goal of the strategy is to maximise minimise risks and costs. It is a long-term investment; the maturity is at least 6 months.</p>
