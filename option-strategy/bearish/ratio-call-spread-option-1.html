         <h3>Description and use</h3>
         <img src="img/19.webp"/>
         <p>Ratio Call Spread strategy is the opposite of Call Ratio Backspread. The difference is that in this strategy, the Short Calls have higher strikes. Consequently, loss is going to be unlimited and profit is going to be limited. Because of the unlimited risk, increasing volatility is harmful for the position. This strategy is not recommended. Stagnating share prices make the situation better. The strategy consists of Short and Long Call options with the same expiration, but different quantities. Typically, the ratio of the sold/purchased Call options is 2:1 or 3:2. The potential loss is unlimited. The direction of the market is neutral/decreasing. The trader speculates on low volatility shares with stagnating prices. The profit is maximised when the share closes at the upper breakeven point. The investment should be short-term, maximum one month.</p>
