         <h3>Description and use</h3>
         <img src="img/25.webp"/>
         <p>Short Combo is the opposite of Long Combo strategy. Short Combo is a synthetic strategy, because it simulates a share-selling situation. To establish the position, the trader buys lower strike Put options and sells higher strike Call options. This investment is short-term and is usually combined with other strategies. The direction of the market is bearish. The strategy is a net credit investment. The loss is unlimited when share prices are increasing.
