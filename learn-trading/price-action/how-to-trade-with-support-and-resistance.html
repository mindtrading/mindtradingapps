<h4><strong>What are SUPPORT AND RESISTANCE?</strong></h4>
<h4><strong>SUPPORT</strong></h4>
<p>Support, as the &ldquo;buying, actual or potential, sufficient in DEMAND to halt a downtrend in prices for an appreciable period.&rdquo; and possibly reverse it, start prices moving up again. Fair price for buyers and risk to reward is more.</p>

<h4><strong>RESISTANCE</strong></h4>
<p>Resistance is the selling, actual or potential, insufficient supply to keep prices from rising for a time and possibly turn back its uptrend. Fair price for sellers and risk to reward is more.</p>

<h4><strong>FLIPPING</strong></h4>
<p>These price levels constantly switch their roles from support to resistance and from resistance to support. A former resistance, once it has been surpassed, becomes a support zone in a subsequent downtrend; and old support, once it has been penetrated, becomes our resistance zone in a later advancing phase.&rdquo;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5342 ezlazyloaded" title="FLIPPING" src="https://dotnettutorials.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/word-image-103.png?ezimgfmt=rs:721x463/rscb8/ng:webp/ngcb8" sizes="(max-width: 721px) 100vw, 721px" srcset="https://dotnettutorials.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/word-image-103.png?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb8 721w,https://dotnettutorials.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/word-image-103-300x193.png?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb8 300w" alt="FLIPPING" width="721" height="463" data-ezsrcset="https://dotnettutorials.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/word-image-103.png?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb8 721w,https://dotnettutorials.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/word-image-103-300x193.png?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb8 300w" data-ezsrc="https://dotnettutorials.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/word-image-103.png?ezimgfmt=rs:721x463/rscb8/ng:webp/ngcb8" /></p>
<h4><strong>Why are Support and Resistance important?</strong></h4>
<p>These points are not random, and the market creates them. They represent momentary changes in demand and supply forces.&nbsp;The bulls could not move the market above the swing high. This means that at that point in time, no one was willing to offer a price higher than the swing high. Traders saw no value above the swing high.</p>
<div class="default-creative-container">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Hence, subsequently, when the price moves close to near or above a wing high, we must remember that traders saw no value in buying above that point previously. Assuming that most traders have not changed their opinions, prices are unlikely to move above the swing high. Effectively, the swing high marks a price area that prevents the market from moving up. This is what we call a resistance area. Reverse for support area.</p>

<h4><strong>The Psychology of Support and Resistance</strong></h4>
<p>To illustrate, let&rsquo;s divide the market participants into three categories: the longs, the shorts, and the uncommitted. When the price comes to the support level/</p>
<ol>
<li>The longs are those traders who have already purchased contracts;</li>
<li>The shorts are those who have already committed themselves to the sell-side;</li>
<li>The uncommitted are those who have been out of the market or remain undecided about which side to enter.</li>
</ol>
<p>Traders who fear missing out would enter their trades when the price comes close to Support to get at a low price. And if there&rsquo;s enough buying pressure, the market would reverse at that location.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s assume that a market starts to move higher from a support area where prices have been fluctuating OR accumulating for some time.</p>

<p>The longs are delighted but regret not having bought more. If the market retraced near that support area again, they could add to their long positions.</p>
<p>The shorts now that they are on the wrong side of the market. The shorts are hoping (and praying) for a dip back to that area where they went short so they can get out of the market where they got in (their break-even point).</p>
<p>The final uncommitted group now realizes that prices are increasing and resolves to enter the market on the long side on the next good buying opportunity.</p>
<div class="default-creative-container">&nbsp;</div>
<p>All four groups are resolved to &ldquo;buy the next dip.&rdquo; They all have a &ldquo;vested interest&rdquo; in that support area under the market. If prices decline near support, renewed buying by all four groups will increase prices.</p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s turn the tables and imagine that instead of moving higher, prices move lower. In the previous situation, because prices advanced, the combined reaction of the market participants caused each downside reaction to be met with additional buying (thereby creating new support). However, if prices drop and move below the previous support zone, the reaction becomes just the opposite. All those who bought in the support zone now realize they made a mistake.</p>
<p>All of the factors that created support by the three categories of participants&mdash;the longs, the shorts, and the uncommitted&mdash;will now function to put a ceiling over prices on subsequent rallies or bounces. All previous buy orders under the market have become sell orders over the market. The support zone has become a resistance zone.</p>
<div class="default-creative-container">&nbsp;</div>
<h4><strong>Support and Resistance Level and Zone</strong></h4>
<p>Support and Resistance Level is more detailed and different levels with the zone. The level is one line, and the Zone is a Zone. In practice, support and resistance and supply and demand zones are formed from the same origin.</p>
<p>Support and Resistance are areas and not lines</p>
<h4><strong>Why?</strong></h4>
<p>Because you&rsquo;ll face these two problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Price undershoot and you miss the trade</li>
<li>Price overshoot, and you assume support and resistance are broken</li>
</ul>
<p>Let me explain&hellip;</p>
<p>Price &ldquo;undershoot,&rdquo; and you missed the trade.&nbsp;This occurs when the market comes close to the support and resistance line but not close enough.</p>
<p>Then, it reverses back in the opposite direction. And you missed the trade because you were waiting for the market to test your SR level. This price reversal is also called 123 reversals. Or holding a higher level of support or lower level of resistance. THIS GENERALLY OCCURS DUE TO THE AGGRESSIVE BUYERS AND SELLERS.<strong>An example: OF PRICE UNDERSHOOT</strong></p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5345 ezlazyloaded" title="Support and Resistance Level and Zone" src="https://dotnettutorials.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/word-image-106.png?ezimgfmt=rs:536x417/rscb8/ng:webp/ngcb8" sizes="(max-width: 536px) 100vw, 536px" srcset="https://dotnettutorials.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/word-image-106.png?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb8 536w,https://dotnettutorials.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/word-image-106-300x233.png?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb8 300w" alt="Support and Resistance Level and Zone" width="536" height="417" data-ezsrcset="https://dotnettutorials.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/word-image-106.png?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb8 536w,https://dotnettutorials.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/word-image-106-300x233.png?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb8 300w" data-ezsrc="https://dotnettutorials.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/word-image-106.png?ezimgfmt=rs:536x417/rscb8/ng:webp/ngcb8" /></p>
<p>Price &ldquo;overshoots&rdquo; and assumes support and resistance are broken</p>
<p>This happens when the market breaks support and resistance levels, and you assume it&rsquo;s broken.&nbsp;Thus, we trade the breakout but only to realize it&rsquo;s a false breakout. THIS TYPE OF PRICE ACTION IS CALLED UPTHRUST AND SPRING</p>
<p><strong>Let&rsquo;s DO AN EXAMPLE OF PRICE OVERSHOOT</strong></p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5346 ezlazyloaded" title="Support and Resistance Level and Zone" src="https://dotnettutorials.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/word-image-107.png?ezimgfmt=rs:700x440/rscb8/ng:webp/ngcb8" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" srcset="https://dotnettutorials.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/word-image-107.png?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb8 700w,https://dotnettutorials.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/word-image-107-300x189.png?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb8 300w" alt="Support and Resistance Level and Zone" width="700" height="440" data-ezsrcset="https://dotnettutorials.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/word-image-107.png?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb8 700w,https://dotnettutorials.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/word-image-107-300x189.png?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb8 300w" data-ezsrc="https://dotnettutorials.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/word-image-107.png?ezimgfmt=rs:700x440/rscb8/ng:webp/ngcb8" /></p>
<p><strong>So, how do you solve these two problems?</strong></p>
<p>Simple, Support, and Resistance are areas on the chart, not lines.</p>
<h4><strong>How to draw support and resistance zone</strong></h4>
<p><strong>A two-step process to find SR ZONE</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Step 1: Switch to a line chart and mark the line with the rejections.</li>
<li>Step 2: Again switch to the candlestick chart, mark the high or low of the candle near the marked line, and make the zone.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Let&rsquo;s do an example of drawing an SR zone</strong></p>

<h4><strong>Timeframe SUPPORT AND RESISTANCE</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The power of support and resistance depends on the time frame we are looking at. The higher the time frame, the higher the probability of it working.</li>
<li>Through all the timeframe support and resistance work, the rewards grow the higher the timeframe is</li>
<li>The noise in the lower time frame chart is more.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using the higher time frame and top-down analysis, put more weight on the higher time frame SR level.</p>
<p>To focus on major support and resistance levels, first, find them on higher time frames before applying them to your trading time frame for analysis.</p>
<p>For example, you can note the support and resistance levels from the weekly chart. Then, plot them on the daily chart to find trading opportunities. This method keeps you focused on important support and resistance levels instead of flooding your chart with dozens of potential support and resistance levels.</p>

<h4><strong>WHERE SUPPORT AND RESISTANCE DEVELOPED?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The first point of support in any time frame is the prior bar&rsquo;s high</li>
<li>The first point of resistance in any time frame is the prior bar&rsquo;s low</li>
<li>The second points of support and resistance are pivot points(swing high and swing low)</li>
<li>Consolidation area</li>
<li>Rejection from an area</li>
<li>Previous has acted as both support and resistance</li>
<li>Gap(invisible tail), EMOTIONAL POINT</li>
<li>Fibo retracement</li>
<li>Trend line and MA</li>
</ul>

<p>Swing highs and swing lows are market turning points. They are natural choices for projecting support and resistance zones.</p>
<h4><strong>CONGESTION AREAS</strong></h4>

<p>Fibonacci retracement is a popular method for projecting support and resistance. We can mark out retracement levels easily.&nbsp;Hence, Identify major market swings and focus on the retracement of the move by a Fibonacci ratio. Generally, Fibonacci ratios include 23.6%, 38.2%, 50%, 61.8% and 100%.</p>

<p>Flipping acts as both support and resistance. Support turned into resistance, or resistance turned into support.&nbsp;When the price breaks through a resistance level, it shifts power from sellers to buyers. The resistance level then becomes support.</p>
<h4><strong>How strong support and resistance</strong></h4>
<p>Many factors should be considered in determining how significant or strong the support or resistance level will be. These factors are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The number of occurrences</strong>.<em>&nbsp;The first-time</em>&nbsp;retrace to the area is strong.</li>
<li><strong>Volume</strong>. The higher the relative volume is at a particular price level, the more likely it is that the price level will become significant support or resistance.</li>
<li><strong>How did the price leave the level?&nbsp;</strong><em>The stronger the price moves away from a zone, the more out-of-balance supply and demand are at that zone. A heavy order is placed by smart money.</em></li>
<li><strong>How much time did the price spend at the zone?</strong>&nbsp;<em>The less time the price spends at a zone, the more out-of-balance supply and demand are at the price level. Smart money aggressively enters</em>&nbsp;When prices retrace and test the level in the future</li>
<li><strong>How far did the price move away from the zone before returning back to the zone?</strong>&nbsp;<em>The farther the price moves away from a zone before returning to that zone, the greater the reward to risk and probability.</em></li>
</ol>
<h4><strong>When support and resistance break</strong></h4>
<p>And even when prices start to falter in the higher region of the chart, bulls are technically still in control as long as they manage to keep the market up at levels higher than or equal to a former significant low. But the stronger the earlier dominance, the less likely the market will turn on any first reversal attempt.</p>
<ul>
<li>Support tends to break into a downtrend</li>
<li>Resistance tends to break into an uptrend</li>
<li>Support and Resistance tend to break when there is a tight range at the SR level.</li>
<li>The more/frequent test of support resistance weakens this level and breaks the level.</li>

<h4><strong>Here&rsquo;s why&hellip;</strong></h4>
<p>The market reverses at RESISTANCE because there is selling pressure to push the price lower. The selling pressure could be from Institutions, banks, or smart money that trades in large orders.</p>
<p>Imagine this:&nbsp;If the market keeps re-testing resistance, these orders will eventually be filled. And when all the orders are filled, who&rsquo;s left to sell?</p>
<p>It shows that participants are more aggressive in pushing/pulling the price to break the resistance/support. While the higher low toward resistance indicates aggressive by the buyers</p>
<p><strong>LET&rsquo;S DO AN EXAMPLE</strong></p>

<p>Higher lows into Resistance usually result in a breakout (formed ascending triangle). Lower highs into Support usually result in a breakdown (formed descending triangle).</p>

<h4><strong>Resistance tends to break into an uptrend.</strong></h4>
<p>For an uptrend to continue, it has to break new highs consistently. So, shorting at resistance is a low-probability trade in an uptrend.&nbsp;Instead, going long at Support is a better trade or break out from the last high.</p>

<h4><strong>Support tends to break into a downtrend.</strong></h4>
<p>For a downtrend to continue, it has to break new lows consistently. So, going long at support isn&rsquo;t a good idea in the downtrend.&nbsp;But, going short at Resistance is a great idea or breakout from the last swing low.</p>
<h4><strong>Support and Resistance tend to break when there&rsquo;s a tight range</strong></h4>
<p>Resistance is an area with potential selling pressure. So, the price should move up quickly.</p>
<p>Now&hellip; what if the price didn&rsquo;t move down and instead consolidated at resistance?</p>
<h4><strong>What does it mean?</strong></h4>
<p>It was a sign of strength as the bears couldn&rsquo;t lower the price.&nbsp;Perhaps there&rsquo;s no selling pressure, or there is strong buying pressure. Either way, it doesn&rsquo;t look good for the bears, and resistance will likely break.&nbsp;An example: the opposite of Resistance:</p>

<h4><strong>Support and Resistance Trading Summary:</strong></h4>
<p>Trading with support and resistance is one of the foundational methods used in technical analysis. Support and resistance levels are like psychological barriers to the price of an asset and can be identified by the high and low price points on a chart where the price has a visible change in direction.&nbsp;Here&rsquo;s a basic guide on how to trade using support and resistance:</p>
<h4><strong>Identifying Support and Resistance:</strong></h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Support Level:</strong>&nbsp;This is a price level where a downtrend can be expected to pause due to a concentration of demand. As the price of an asset drops, demand for the shares increases, thus forming the support line.</li>
<li><strong>Resistance Level:</strong>&nbsp;Conversely, this is a price level where a trend can pause or reverse due to a concentration of selling interest. As the price of an asset rises, sellers begin to outnumber buyers, leading to downward pressure and a potential reversal in direction.</li>
</ol>
<h4><strong>Drawing Support and Resistance:</strong></h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Horizontal Lines:</strong>&nbsp;The most basic way to identify these levels is by connecting the high and low points on a chart with horizontal lines.</li>
<li><strong>Trend Lines:</strong>&nbsp;These can be drawn along the successive highs or lows in a trending market to indicate dynamic support and resistance levels.</li>
<li><strong>Moving Averages:</strong>&nbsp;These can also act as dynamic support and resistance levels as the price of an asset tends to bounce off the moving average lines.</li>
</ol>
<h4><strong>Trading Strategies:</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Buy at Support:</strong>&nbsp;Traders may enter a long position when the price of an asset is at or near the support level, expecting the price to rise.</li>
<li><strong>Sell at Resistance:</strong>&nbsp;Conversely, they may take a short position or sell when the price approaches the resistance level, anticipating a decline.</li>
<li><strong>Breakouts:</strong>&nbsp;When the price breaks through a resistance level, it could signal a new upward trend, leading traders to enter a long position. Similarly, a break below a support level might indicate a new downtrend, prompting a short position.</li>
<li><strong>Bounces:</strong>&nbsp;A price bouncing off a support or resistance level and not breaking through it can be a signal for a trade in the direction of the bounce.</li>
<li><strong>Pullbacks:</strong>&nbsp;After a breakout, prices often retest the breached support or resistance level &ndash; a pullback. Traders might wait for a pullback to complete before entering a trade.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Tips for Trading with Support and Resistance:</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Confirmation:</strong>&nbsp;Look for confirmatory signals such as candlestick patterns (like a pin bar or engulfing pattern) at these levels before entering a trade.</li>
<li><strong>Volume:</strong>&nbsp;Increasing volume on a breakout or at support/resistance levels can confirm the strength of the level.</li>
<li><strong>Time Frames:</strong>&nbsp;Confirm support and resistance levels across different time frames for greater reliability.</li>
<li><strong>Risk Management:</strong>&nbsp;Always use stop-loss orders to limit potential losses if the price breaks through a support or resistance level unexpectedly.</li>
<li><strong>Flexibility:</strong>&nbsp;Treat support and resistance levels as zones rather than precise lines because market movements can often penetrate these levels slightly before respecting them.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Common Mistakes to Avoid:</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ignoring Trend:</strong>&nbsp;The current trend should dictate your bias toward support and resistance. In an uptrend, emphasize support levels; in a downtrend, focus on resistance.</li>
<li><strong>Relying Solely on S&amp;R:</strong>&nbsp;Do not base trades solely on these levels; use other indicators and analysis methods to confirm signals.</li>
<li><strong>Not Accounting for False Breakouts:</strong>&nbsp;Sometimes, the price may briefly break through a level before reversing. This is known as a false breakout or &ldquo;fakeout.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Risk Management:</strong>&nbsp;Always combine support and resistance strategies with sound risk management practices. This means knowing where to exit if the market moves against your position and only risking a small percentage of your trading capital on any single trade.</p>

<p><strong>Technical Nuance:</strong>&nbsp;Remember that these levels are more accurately represented as zones rather than strict lines. Many traders look for areas of support and resistance rather than exact price points. This considers the market volatility and the fact that different traders may draw slightly different levels.</p>
<p>Trading with support and resistance is best used with other indicators and analysis techniques. It requires practice to interpret support and resistance levels accurately, and traders should always be prepared for the eventuality that the market may not respect them.</p>
